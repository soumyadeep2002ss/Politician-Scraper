The 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party was elected by the 18th National Congress on 15 November 2012, and sat in plenary sessions until the communing of the 19th National Congress in 2017. It was formally proceeded by the 17th Central Committee.

The committee is composed of full members and alternate members.[1] A member has voting rights, while an alternate does not.[1] If a full member is removed from the CC the vacancy is then filled by an alternate member at the next committee plenum — the alternate member who received the most confirmation votes in favour is highest on the order of precedence.[1] To be elected to the Central Committee, a candidate must be a party member for at least five years.[1]

The first plenary session in 2012 was responsible for electing the bodies in which the authority of the Central Committee was invested when it was not in session: the Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee. It was also responsible for approving the members of the Secretariat, Central Commission of Discipline Inspection and its Standing Committee. The second plenary session in March 2013 was responsible for nominating candidates for state positions.

The remaining plenary sessions of the 18th Central Committee were known for announcing a wide range of reform programs on a scale unprecedented since the Deng era, including "comprehensively deepening reforms", "ruling the country according to law", and complete the construction of a "moderately prosperous society". The 18th CC also saw the highest number of members expelled from the body due to corruption in the party's history.

The 18th CC was elected using the method "more candidates than seats".[2][a] At the 18th National Congress, delegates could vote for 224 possible candidates for 205 seats for full membership, and 190 candidates for the 171 alternate members.[4] 8.5 percent of the member candidates and 10 percent of the alternate candidates failed to be elected.[4] Of the 373 full and alternate members, 184 of them (i.e., 48.9 percent) were elected to the Central Committee for the first time.[5] Five of the nine members born in the 1960s were associated with the Communist Youth League (designated as Tuanpai by foreign commentators).[6]

Few offspring of previously high-standing officials (known as "princelings") managed to obtain full membership on the 18th CC, though a few were named alternate members.[b][6] The number of members who worked in central-controlled state-owned enterprises increased from one in the 17th CC to six, while Zhang Ruimin (head of Haier) was re-elected.[7] The number of members from the military remained constant from the previous committee at around 20 percent, continuing a longstanding tradition.[6]

Plenum	Start–end	Length	Summary
1st Plenary Session	15 November 2012	1 day	Xi Jinping was elected General Secretary and CMC Chairman. A 25-member Politburo, 7-member Politburo Standing Committee and seven member Secretariat with Liu Yunshan as first-ranking secretary were elected. The plenum approved the composition SC–CCDI elected by the CCDI 1st Plenary Session, and the election of Wang Qishan as CCDI Secretary, CCDI Secretary-General and several CCDI deputy secretaries.
2nd Plenary Session	26–28 February 2013	3 days	The meeting approved lists of nominees for leading posts within the 12th National People's Congress and the 12th CPPCC National Committee, as well as a State Council restructuring plan aimed at a "simpler and decentralized administration".[citation needed]
3rd Plenary Session	9–12 November 2013	4 days	Xi Jinping made a report on behalf of the Politburo titled '"The Decision on Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reforms".[8] Market allocation of resources was given, in official speech, a "decisive role".[9] Procedures were taken to liberalize the banking system, with the goal of achieving significant results by 2020.[9] The National Security Commission and the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms were established, and both are led by Xi.[9] The meeting anticipated the abolition of re-education through labour and an easing to the one-child policy.[9]
4th Plenary Session	20–23 October 2014	4 days	It passed a comprehensive package of legal reforms.[10] The decision upheld the supremacy of Communist Party rule and emphasized the importance of the Constitution.[10] It resolved to establish circuit tribunals (巡视法庭) and cross-jurisdictional circuit courts and prosecution agencies.[11] The decision also said that management of court resources of in municipal and lower level courts would be managed directly by the provincial level.[11] The Central Committee passed resolution to expel Yang Jinshan, Jiang Jiemin, and Li Dongsheng, officials who have been dismissed during the anti-corruption campaign launched after the 1st Plenary Session.[10]
5th Plenary Session	26–29 October 2015[12]	4 days	The session passed a draft of the 13th five-year plan, with provisions for combating poverty. Secondary education for children of less well-off families will gradually be made free, including any school fees; the document also called for a "comprehensively well-off society" by 2020 and a total elimination of "poverty counties" (pinkunxian), and a universal relaxation of the one-child policy: any married couples could now have two children. The Central Committee passed a resolution confirming the expulsion of CC members Ling Jihua, Zhou Benshun, Yang Dongliang, and CC alternate members Zhu Mingguo, Wang Min, Chen Chuanping, Qiu He, Yang Weize, Pan Yiyang, and Yu Yuanhui from the party; at the time, this was the largest ever number of CC members expelled during any CC plenum due to corruption; the record was broken two years later at the 7th plenum.[13]
6th Plenary Session	24–27 October 2016	4 days	The 6th plenum's main focus was on "strict discipline and supervision of the Communist Party." Xi Jinping strove for greater transparency in the decision-making process in local governance, which also represents his effort to establish a positive image of China's Communist Party overseas. This is in addition to his actively promoted anti-corruption campaign within China's political system. Xi was declared the "leadership core" of the party. The Central Committee passed a resolution confirming the expulsion of CC member Wang Min, and CC alternate members Lü Xiwen, Fan Changmi, and Niu Zhizhong.[14]
7th Plenary Session	11–14 October 2017	4 days	The 7th plenum was the final plenary session of the 18th Central Committee, convened to affirm achievements of the past five years and laying the groundwork for the 19th Party Congress.

The plenum saw the greatest number of expulsions at a single plenum post-Cultural Revolution party history.[15]

Notes
Name, Ethnicity, Office, Rank and institutional membership are listed in accordance with the Hanzi column, but can be sorted alphabetical by pressing the button next to the column titles.
The Hanzi column is listed according to the number of strokes in their surnames, which is the official ordering method.
Ranks listed are the highest rank each individual held during their term; if they were promoted from sub-provincial level to provincial-ministerial level during their term on the Central Committee, they would be listed under a provincial-ministerial level rank; military ranks are listed separately from civilian ranks, with the exception of military officials who hold positions on civilian bodies, in which case both military and civilian ranks are listed
The Office column lists offices that the individual held during their term on the Central Committee (i.e. between 2012 and 2017) and is not intended to be an exhaustive list of offices they held over the course of their career; if the individual was transferred between different offices, dates are included to indicate the time period they held each office. Generally, offices held between the conclusion of the 18th Party Congress and the National People's Congress in March 2013 are excluded. Dates reflect the term of office only within the duration of the CC session; therefore someone whose term in parentheses indicates 2012–2015, for example, does not necessarily imply that they held the office beginning in 2012; similarly, those whose term ends in 2017 does not necessarily indicate that they relinquished that office in 2017.
Only substantive offices are listed; for example it is customary that an individual will hold office both as provincial party secretary and chair of the provincial People's Congress. In this table, the latter title is not listed.

Alternates[edit]
Notes
The individuals below are listed according to the number of votes in favour received at the Party Congress that elected the committee; if the number of votes in favour they received were the same, they are ordered by the number of strokes in their surnames.
Name (birth–death), Ethnicity, Office, and Rank can be sorted alphabetical by pressing the button next to the column titles.
Replacement of expelled CC full members
At each plenum, previously expelled full members of the Central Committee are replaced by alternate members. Alternate members are promoted to full members based on their rank sequence, determined by the number of votes they received at the previous party congress. In October 2017, at the 7th plenum, 11 such replacements were made. However, in a seeming departure from protocol, Liu Xuepu, Zhu Yanfeng, Zheng Qunliang, and Zhao Jin were skipped over from consideration – a possible indication that they had themselves ran afoul of party regulations prior to the plenum.

Provincial Party Standing Committee
Notes[edit]
^ Prior to the 1980s, the composition of the Central Committee was essentially pre-determined by the party's top leaders.[3] However, beginning at the 13th Party Congress in 1987, the number of candidates standing for office had been increased to be greater than the number of seats available.[3] With this method, the candidates that receive the lowest confirmation votes in favour at a party congress would not be elected.[3]
^ It is notable that Li Xiaopeng, the son of Li Peng, gathered the fewest votes of those elected to alternate membership, making him rank last on the alternate member list.[7] Li served as Governor of Shanxi during his term as an alternate member of the Central Committee.[7]
^ "Active" political positions refer to the offices of Governor and provincial-level Party Secretary; often, an individual is considered retired when they relinquish either of those offices due to age, and are assigned some kind of committee membership in the National People's Congress.
^ Wu Aiying's expulsion from the party at the plenum was the first public announcement of her downfall; she had been Minister of Justice earlier in 2017 and seemingly retired without much fanfare.
^ Wang Zhigang's position is unusual in that he is a party branch secretary of a ministry, as opposed to a minister. In most cases, a minister is concurrently the party branch secretary of the ministry. In this case, the Minister of Science and Technology, Wan Gang, is not a member of the Communist Party, so Wang tends to party duties at the ministry and is ranked as a full minister-level official.
^ Quan has been, since 2006, a minister-level official by virtue of his position as the party branch secretary of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, which is nominally a non-partisan, apolitical body that is given ministry-level status for the purposes of administration and protocol. He is the only ethnic Korean full member of the Central Committee.
^ Li was investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and assigned leading responsibility for corruption at the Ministry of Civil Affairs; as a result, he lost his Central Committee membership. He was, however, allowed to maintain his party membership on a two-year probationary basis.
^ Yang was investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and accused of disciplinary failings, and demoted in 2017.
^ Wu Xinxiong holds a position that is normally considered deputy-minister level. However he was formerly the Governor of Jiangxi and maintained his rank when he transferred to positions in Beijing. His successor Nur Bekri was given similar treatment.
