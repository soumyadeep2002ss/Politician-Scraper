Michele Jennings was born in Sacramento, California and has been entertaining audiences nearly her entire life. She began performing for family functions and then graduated to performing throughout the city. A dancing prodigy, Michele's dancing talents were amazingly impressive and she soon became the dominant dancer with rap superstar "McHammer". McHammer along with his other back-up dancers and singers had the chance to share the stage with incredible opening acts like EnVogue, Jodeci, Boys 2 Men and TLC.It was a good friend who officially brought Michele to McHammer's attention and by 1989 she was on the road back-to-back performing hits like "You Can't Touch This", "2 Legit 2 Quit". As a product of the 80s, Michele had emerged as one of the most accomplished black dancer in hip-hop music history, successfully evolving from street-like dancer to a professional phenomenon.Solo success for Michele is inevitable and by the mid 90s, she had become infinitely more excited about breaking away from the nest that she had known since she was 17. Dancing (with other Artist) and Commercial ("The Indiana Jones Ride") gigs consistently orbited, culminating nice residuals to cover any down time she might encounter. A TV natural, she ventured into films, TV & Plays, such as playing a Gang Member in "Strange Days" and a Black Panther in "Panthers", Charlotte in "Beyond Therapy" and Doris in "Owl and the Pussycat". Michele is on her way to acting in elaborate films.Another good friend of Michele introduced her to one of the Executive Producer's of the hit TV show,"Proud Family, The" (2001)_, who brought Michele on board as a Voiceover Actor. Since then, Michele has added more acting gigs to her credits. Along with being Development Director of Jambalaya Studio and Associate Producer on a film called "Marigold" which was released August 2008.Despite it all, Michele's skills as a dancer, actor and business person is unparalleled, and it is these prodigious talents that will ultimately prevail over the negative aspects of her life.
