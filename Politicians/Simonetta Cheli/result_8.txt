Clouds remain one of the biggest uncertainties in how the atmosphere drives the climate system. A better understanding of the relationship between clouds, aerosols and radiation is a high priority in both climate research and weather prediction.
That's exactly the job of the upcoming European Space Agency - ESA / JAXA: Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency #EarthCARE mission! 
Here's a technical overview of the satellite's instruments:

Exciting to see research is being done on this topic.  When I first heart about reflection of solar radiation through clouds and white surfaces, one of my thoughts was that contrails could be helpful to block solar radiatio.  Ulrich Schumann shared a couple weeks ago their research on impact of contrails.  As the graph shows there is also the aspect of trapping radiation and would heat up the atmosphere.  
❓Could there be a solution where airplanes create for specific segments of their flight contrails❓

True. Clouds, Aerosols are a major factor in varying uncertainty ranges in different climate models. Such variances in turn have a significant impact on communicating &  building trust amongst all the stakeholders.

yes, I agree with you. In fact, I attempted to observe if the terrain under the cloud has a role in shaping the cloud's amazing structure. Beautiful clouds.

An exiting start of the week and the year with European Fisheries Control Agency - EFCA!

We signed a Memorandum of Understanding to work together on using #EarthObservation data to ensure #sustainableoceans. 
Looking forward to working together🛰️

Very interesting day today visiting SITAEL establishment.

SITAEL will supply satellites with hyperspectral optical instrumentation for the Italian IRIDE Earth Observation Constellation (IRIDE Spazio).

Exciting times ahead in 2024 for us at the European Space Agency - ESA's Earth Observation Programme 🛰️!

As we embark on a year of launches, ESA EO is set to achieve new milestones with five planned launches - a record for us! 
Here's a sneak peek into what's coming.

FutureEO - EarthCARE Launch (May 2023):
Get ready for the launch of EarthCARE, our most complex Earth Explorer ever, in collaboration with JAXA: Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. This mission marks a breakthrough by measuring vertical profiles of cloud particles and aerosols with the goal to enhance climate models and weather predictions.

Innovative New Space Micro-satellite  
Arctic Weather Satellite (launching in June): 
Embracing a New Space approach, this micro-satellite will shed new light on the rapidly changing Arctic. Carrying a cross-track scanning microwave radiometer, the Arctic Weather Satellite mission provides measurements of atmospheric humidity and temperature.

Phisat-2 (launching in June): 
Demonstrating AI technology for Earth observation, leading to revolutionary ways of collecting, distributing, and analysing data about our planet.

Copernicus Sentinels 
Critical continuity for the world's largest EO operational program, Copernicus, with new units for 2 Sentinel missions: Sentinel-1C and Sentinel-2C.

🌍 Moreover, stay tuned for ESA's brand-new Earth Science Strategy set to be unveiled around mid-2024. This strategy will address the impact of climate change, the needs of a growing global population, and advances in Earth system knowledge, open science, commercial space, and digital innovation.

🌱 In line with our commitment to climate action, ESA will continue working on the next steps of key projects such as the Space for Green Future Accelerator and the next phase of the Destination Earth initiative.

There is still so much untapped potential of #EarthObservation for the health sector.
This (and more) is being discussed today and tomorrow at the #EO4Health User Forum: https://lnkd.in/dRfgpt99). 
Following a number of pilot projects in this domain, we recently kicked off a new activity called EO4Health Resilience (more info: https://lnkd.in/dbuyvDPg).
This project involves NGOs and large entities in the health sector and foresees a hackathon in Spring. 
 Agreements for cooperation are already in place with World Health Organization, FAO and the United Nations Environmental Programme, but the  European Space Agency - ESA is currently seeking further collaborations with public and private actors and non-governmental organisations, to co-design new solutions that could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare policies and operations, creating more resilient societies.
 
Earth Observation data is very helpful to understand the ideal climatic and environmental conditions for water borne (eg: Colera and E. coli. More info here: https://lnkd.in/d6YiK66H), vector borne (eg: Malaria, West Nile virus. See here for more info: https://lnkd.in/dyD3s3fe) and non-communicable diseases (eg: cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases linked to environmental factors).
 
An interesting report on the latest trends in the health sector and how it intersects with the space sector can be found here: https://lnkd.in/darCTbnJ

If you will be following #WEF2024 pin this down! 
#AI is already a big part of #EarthObservation and its role will increase even more in the near future.

⚠️#WEF2024 👇
 
Space is finally getting the attention it deserves, rising in political and societal relevance as a practical solution to the real challenges of today and tomorrow. Have you ever thought about how European space missions can help to shape the safer, greener, more sustainable and more efficient society of the future that you envision?
 
ESA astronaut Matthias Mauer and I will be at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week to discuss with world leaders, academia, industry, and the media about:
 
✔️Global risks such as poverty rates, extreme weather, and water quality and how we can use Earth Observation data-driven decision making to forecast and mitigate
✔️Using AI to tackle climate change
✔️Human exploration of the Moon and beyond
✔️Industry and technology of the future
✔️The growing importance of cooperation and partnerships, particularly with the rising players
✔️Satellites for safety and security
✔️Predictions and best practices for a healthy space economy
 
My personal highlights for the week:
 
Monday
➡️Opening Ceremony
 
Tuesday
➡️The Global Risks Consortium
➡️”Activating the Commercial Use of Earth Observation Data for Climate and Nature”. Moderated by Stacy Janiak, I will be a firestarter alongside Gim Neo, and Ibrahim Al-Zu'bi from Deloitte, Centre for Nature and Climate at WEF, and ADNOC Group, respectively.
 
Wednesday
➡️ “Beyond Borders: The Space Industry and Technology of the Future” where Henry Foy from Financial Times will moderate and I will be a panellist alongside Dan Tenney from Lockheed Martin and Grzegorz Zwolinski from the SatRev.
➡️ “Taming Competition in Low and High Orbit” livestreamed at 👉https://lnkd.in/dYEt8QEY Moderated by Alison Snyder from Axios, my fellow panelists will be Doreen Bogdan-Martin from International Telecommunication Union, Guru Gowrappan from Viasat, and my longtime professional friend, Will Marshall from Planet Labs.
➡️ “Where Will the Space Economy be by 2035?” where I will be joined by several experts and thought leaders in the field.
 
Thursday
➡️ “Space*AI” Moderated by Daniel Dobos from Swisscom, I will be joined by Olivier Oullier from Inclusive Brains and Brian Schmidt, Nobel Laureate in Physics.
 
Any media requests can be made to ESA Media Relations, Bernhard L. von Weyhe, at bvw@esa.int.

Call for media: secure a seat to see the #Earthcare satellite one last time before it ships to the launch site! 

All info here: 
https://lnkd.in/dw4CZDYS 

EarthCARE is the largest and most complex of all of ESA’s trailblazing Earth Explorer missions – missions that deliver critical information to understand how our world functions and the impact that human activity is having on natural processes.

Great news from ESA Council: 

ESA Council approved the Amendment of the Contribution Agreement between the European Space Agency - ESA and the European Commission. DestinE will enter its second phase in mid-June of 2024 and will evolve the DestinE system and ramp-up operations, with a focus on consolidation, maintenance and continuous evolution of the components of the DestinE system.
The digital twins will be accessible through a user-friendly and secure cloud-based digital modelling and simulation platform that will be developed by ESA.
The models will help scientists, politicians and the general public to understand the complex interactions that environment and humans will play in shaping Earth’s future: https://lnkd.in/dvxFAPRX
