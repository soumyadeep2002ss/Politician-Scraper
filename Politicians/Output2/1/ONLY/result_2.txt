Provincial Party Standing Committee
Notes[edit]
^ Prior to the 1980s, the composition of the Central Committee was essentially pre-determined by the party's top leaders.[3] However, beginning at the 13th Party Congress in 1987, the number of candidates standing for office had been increased to be greater than the number of seats available.[3] With this method, the candidates that receive the lowest confirmation votes in favour at a party congress would not be elected.[3]
^ It is notable that Li Xiaopeng, the son of Li Peng, gathered the fewest votes of those elected to alternate membership, making him rank last on the alternate member list.[7] Li served as Governor of Shanxi during his term as an alternate member of the Central Committee.[7]
^ "Active" political positions refer to the offices of Governor and provincial-level Party Secretary; often, an individual is considered retired when they relinquish either of those offices due to age, and are assigned some kind of committee membership in the National People's Congress.
^ Wu Aiying's expulsion from the party at the plenum was the first public announcement of her downfall; she had been Minister of Justice earlier in 2017 and seemingly retired without much fanfare.
^ Wang Zhigang's position is unusual in that he is a party branch secretary of a ministry, as opposed to a minister. In most cases, a minister is concurrently the party branch secretary of the ministry. In this case, the Minister of Science and Technology, Wan Gang, is not a member of the Communist Party, so Wang tends to party duties at the ministry and is ranked as a full minister-level official.
^ Quan has been, since 2006, a minister-level official by virtue of his position as the party branch secretary of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, which is nominally a non-partisan, apolitical body that is given ministry-level status for the purposes of administration and protocol. He is the only ethnic Korean full member of the Central Committee.
^ Li was investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and assigned leading responsibility for corruption at the Ministry of Civil Affairs; as a result, he lost his Central Committee membership. He was, however, allowed to maintain his party membership on a two-year probationary basis.
^ Yang was investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and accused of disciplinary failings, and demoted in 2017.
^ Wu Xinxiong holds a position that is normally considered deputy-minister level. However he was formerly the Governor of Jiangxi and maintained his rank when he transferred to positions in Beijing. His successor Nur Bekri was given similar treatment.
