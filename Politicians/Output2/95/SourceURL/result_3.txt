PREFACE 
Free  and  fair  elections  are  the  corner  stones  of  democracy.  India  is  the  largest  
democracy  in  the  world  and  is  known  world  over  for  conducting  free,  fair  and  peaceful  
elections.  Elections  in  India  are  conducted  under  the  direction,  control  and  supervision  of  the  
Election  Commission  of  India.  The  actual  task  of  conducting  elections  is  carried  out  at  the  
State  level  by  the  State  election  machinery,  aided  by  the  District  Administration  and  various  
other  functionaries,  which  prominently  include  the  Booth  Level  Officers  appointed  for  each  
polling stations. 
The  polling  for  General  Elections  to  14
th
  Vidhan  Sabha  was  conducted  in  the  State  on  
1
st
  Dec.,  2013.  The  programme  schedule  of  these  elections  was  announced  by  Election  
Commission  of  India  on  4th  Oct.,  2013.  All  200  ACs  of  the  State  were  subject  to  polls  on  a  
single day.  
The  planning  for  these  elections  had  started  long  before,  in  fact  since  the  annual  
revision of the electoral roll with reference to date 1.1.2013. At that time, the emphasis was on 
increasing  enrolment  of  voters,  focusing  specially  on  youth  and  women  voters.  Also,  drives  
were launched to improve the health of electoral roll with regard to deletion of duplicate entries, 
correction of errors and improving the  EPIC/PER  ratio.  After  final  publication of electoral rolls 
on 5
th
 Jan., 2013, a drive for enrolment of women voters especially was continued to improve 
the  gender  ratio  of  electoral  roll.  In  the  months  of  July  and  Aug.,  2013,  a  Special  Summary  
Revision  of  Electoral  Roll  was  again  undertaken  to  give  opportunity  to  remaining  electors  to  
enroll  themselves  and  also  to  improve  the  health  of  electoral  roll  further.  The  exercise  for  
rationalization of polling stations was carried out much before in the year 2012 itself.  
After the Special Summary Revision held in Aug., 2013, the Election Department carried 
out a detailed and vigorous training programme for various levels of officers. At the same time, 
the  Department  prepared  detailed  Compendia  of  instructions  on  various  subjects  and  started  
preparing for the conduct of poll. The Election Department also prepared training literature for 
various  categories  of  officials  incorporating  latest  guidelines  and  instructions  of  the  Election  
Commission of India. 
The  biggest  challenge  before  the  Election  Department  was  firstly  to  ensure  a  peaceful  
and  fair  poll  and  secondly  to  ensure  having  voter  participation.  For  ensuring  free,  fair  and  
peaceful  election,  the  Election  Department  requested  the  Election  Commission  of  India  to  
provide adequate Central Para-military Forces (CPMF). As a result, the State got an allocation 
of  509  Companies  of  CPMF,  which  is  the  highest  ever  for  Assembly  poll.  With  proper  

deployment  of  the  CPMF  as  well  as  State  Level  Forces,  it  was  ensured  that  a  fully  secure  
atmosphere  was  provided  in  all  parts  of  Rajasthan.  The  result  of  this  exercise  was  that  the  
Assembly  poll  in  th  entire  Sate  was  completely  incident  free  and  peaceful.    A  detailed  
vulnerability  mapping  exercise  was  also  carried  out  before  the  Polls  to  ensure  that  the  
vulnerable  voters  who  are  normally  denied  their  voting  rights,  also  come  forward  easily  to  
exercise their franchise.  
A  detailed  and  carefully  planned,  Voter  Awareness  Programme  was  embarked  upon  
during  the  run  up  of  the  Polls,  under  SVEEP(Systematic  Voter  Education  and  Empowerment  
Programme). Innovatively designed  messages were floated for targeting various categories of 
voters like youth, women and the urban voters.  Ground level activities were also undertaken in 
a big way by all Districts to motivate voters to come out and cast their vote on the poll day. All 
this was done under the Systematic Voter Education and Empowerment Programme (SVEEP) 
under the guidance provided by Election Commission of India.  
Due to these efforts made by Election Department, a historically high voter participation 
of  75.76%  was  recorded  in  the  Assembly  Polls  -2013  in  Rajasthan.  Not  only  this,  for  the  first  
time, the participation of female voters was more than the participation of male voters in so far 
as voting at polling booths is concerned. The Election Commission of India took cognizance of 
this  high  achievements  of  the  State  and  honored  the  State  with  National  Award  for  Best  
Electoral  Practices,  which  was  given  away  by  the  Hon’ble  President  of  India  on  25
th
  Jan.,  
2014.

The  entire  election  machinery  at  the  field  level  comprising  of  District  Administration,  
police officers, Booth Level Officers and other officers involved in the election process need to

and  officials  of  the  Election  Department  also  similarly  deserve  appreciation  for  their  untiring
