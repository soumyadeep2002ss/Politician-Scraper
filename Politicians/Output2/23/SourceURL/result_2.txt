The Cabinet
The Cabinet is a group 
of councillors that 
takes most of  
the decisions on  
what the Council  
does. 
It is made up of a 
Leader chosen  
by the Full Council  
and nine other 
councillors appointed 
by the Leader.
•  Each Cabinet 
 member looks after  
 an individual area  
 of responsibility
•  They make decisions  
 on how the Council’s  
 services are delivered
