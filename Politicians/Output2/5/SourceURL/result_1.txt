In a decision delivered on Friday, the Quebec Court of Appeal has reversed a judge’s decision made four years ago and has ordered that former city of Montreal executive committee chairperson Frank Zampino undergo a new trial on fraud and corruption charges.

In 2019, Quebec Court Judge Joëlle Roy ruled that Zampino’s rights were violated during a Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit (UPAC) investigation because police recorded conversations Zampino had with his lawyers. Roy placed a stay of proceedings on the charges filed in the case against Zampino and other accused.

The Crown appealed Roy’s decision and on Friday the Quebec Court of Appeal ordered the new trial.

“Although it finds the respondents’ rights were violated, the court is of the view, however, that such violations were not so serious as to warrant a stay of proceedings. Although the police’s conduct during the wiretap operation may be marked by negligence, the seriousness of the conduct was considerably less than that found by the trial judge, such that a stay of proceedings is not the only remedy,” the appellate court wrote in a special summary of its lengthy decision.

As part of the UPAC probe, investigators were authorized to intercept the conversations of 39 people. The authorization included a clause that allowed the interception of conversations the people targeted had with “unknown persons.”

Only Zampino and another accused were targeted by the wiretaps.

“That wiretap operation led to the interception of numerous private communications. Of those interceptions, several hundred involved the participation of lawyers,” the court wrote.

The court also decided that five other people charged in the same case — Bernard Poulin, Normand Brousseau, Dany Moreau, Robert Marcil and Kaziemierz Olechnowicz — will also have to undergo a new trial. Zampino was the first to file a motion for the stay of proceedings, invoking an infringement of his rights under Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The other men charged in the case filed a motion based on similar considerations.

The UPAC investigation began as a probe into the city’s controversial water-meter contract and broadened into an investigation into political financing. The charges alleged Zampino and his co-accused were involved in a scheme to hand out municipal contracts to engineering firms in return for political financing, kickbacks and other benefits.

The men are charged with fraud, breach of trust, municipal corruption and conspiracy.

Working under then-mayor Gérald Tremblay, Zampino, 64, was second-in-command at Montreal city hall from 2002 to 2008.
