address you all at this 106THInternational Labor Conferenceat the ILO. FirstI 
would like totake thisopportunitytocongratulatethe president for his election 
and  effective  chairing  of  the  conference.  Similarity  I  must  commend  Director 
Guy Ryder and his team at the ILOfor his visionary leadership, innovative ideas
that compel this   important organization to address issues thatare important to
the world of work as well as humanity at large.

migration, decentwork for peace and resilience and fundamental principles are

th

about  30% where women and  45% youth ,  voted for change and new direction 
for the country. 
The   overwhelming   support   that   Somali people   have   shown   puts   huge 
responsibilities on the government to deliver.The sustainability of the popularity 
and the legitimacy of the state very much hinges   on our ability as a government 
to deliver on the most basic of public goods and it is also has a bearing on our 
state building efforts.  
The legacy of decades of sustained conflict, insecurity and state fragility has led 
to  high  –Un-employment  rate,  poverty,  infrastructural  gaps      and  weak  state  
institutions. To  address  these  daunting  developmental  challenges  and  bring 
about  transformational change  that  uplifts  the  living  conditions  of  our  citizens  
and  attain  social justice  our  government  has    embarked  on  radical  path  of  
structural, legislative, and institutional reforms. 
 As identified in our national development plan some of the  key priority policy 
areas  include:  reforming    the  financial  sector  Civil  service,  security  sector  and 
the  adoption  of  country  strategies  for  poverty  reduction  with  the  creation  of  
decent and environmentally friendly jobs at the center. 
Mr. President    
The issue of Labor migration was highly discussed and debated in the respective 
subcommittees.    In  an  era  of  globalization, understandably  so, the  increased

mobility of   human resources as well capital from one part of the world to the 
other      is  becoming  a  very  sensitive  subject.    Somalia,  however,  welcomes  the   
pragmatic approach of the ILO to deal with the issue of labor migration and the 
need  to  think  about  the      governance  of  labor  migration  both  domestically  and  
globally.  
If I might share my  country’s mixed experience with  Labor migration with you 
all   : on one hand, the Somali  diaspora sends about an estimated 2 billion dollars 
annually back  home  which  serves  as    life  line  to  hundreds  of  thousands  of  
Somali house holds,  on the other hand the dangerous and inhumane conditions 
that  the Somali youth are exposed to while  traveling through the  north African 
desert and the unforgiving  Mediterranean  sea in which thousands have paid the 
ultimate  price  of  losing  their  life  .this   is  a  matter  of  serious concern  for  the  
Somali government and must come to an end through the creation of decent jobs 
at home.   
Therefore,    for  the  Somali  government  and  the  Somali  people  the  creation  of  
decent  jobs  is  not  singular  objective  we  seek  to  deal with  unemployment  in  its  
the  ‘traditional  sense’,  the  absence  of  social  protection  schemes,    places the 
Somali youth in a very difficult situation where their choices for survival comes 
down   to   either   taking   on   the   dangerous   north   African   desert   and   the   
Mediterranean  ocean  to  reach  Europe  or  even   worst  becoming   vulnerable  to  
being recruited by extremist and anti-statist forces such as Al-shabaab
