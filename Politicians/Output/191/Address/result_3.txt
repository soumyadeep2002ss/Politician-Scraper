Lalduhoma, the founder of Zoram People's Movement (ZPM), took oath as the chief minister of Mizoram on Friday. The swearing-in ceremony, presided over by Governor Hari Babu Kambhampati, took place at the Raj Bhavan complex in Aizawl.

Having met the Governor on Thursday to stake his claim to form the government, Lalduhoma expressed his gratitude for the honor and outlined the priorities of his administration. "Our priority is to support agriculture, and we have identified four key items for immediate attention," he said.

The ZPM leader, who led his party to a resounding victory by securing 27 out of 40 assembly constituencies in Mizoram, shared his thoughts on the historic win. "This is the blessing of God and the people, for which I am very happy and thankful. We had been expecting such a significant win. There is no contender at all, as it was already announced to the people that if ZPM returns to power, Lalduhoma is going to be the CM," he said.

Following the swearing-in ceremony, Lalduhoma plans to hold a press conference to unveil the government's priorities. The ZPM's triumph marked a departure from the longstanding political trend in Mizoram, breaking the cycle of power between the MNF and the Congress.

Lalduhoma's journey, from overseeing the security detail of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to leading the ZPM to victory, reflects a lifetime of overcoming challenges. A former IPS officer, Lalduhoma's career began in 1977. He served as a squad leader in Goa, tackling issues related to drug supply and smugglers, earning recognition from the national media.

Lalduhoma quit his job to join the Congress and was elected from Mizoram's lone Lok Sabha seat in 1984. He eventually founded the ZPM six years ago. The party quickly gained prominence, becoming a key player in Mizoram's political landscape.
