Ms. Beagle is a diplomat from New Zealand and a senior international civil servant. She brings some forty years of experience of multilateral diplomacy, working on peace and security, development, human rights, management, gender and organizational reform.

Throughout her career, Ms. Beagle has played a leadership role in the interagency bodies of the UN system, including as Chair of the High-Level Committee on Management of the CEB, and Chair of the CEB Task Force to address sexual harassment in UN organizations. She was formerly the Chair of the Assistant Secretary-General Advisory Group of the UN Development Group and a member of the Board of the UN System Staff College. 

Ms. Beagle is a committed advocate for gender equality and an active member of the International Gender Champions, a leadership network that brings together senior female and male decision makers to break down gender barriers. She has spearheaded the development and implementation of programs and approaches to improve and accelerate diversity and inclusion, women’s empowerment and rights-based approaches.
