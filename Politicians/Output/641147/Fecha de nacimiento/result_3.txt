“Urbs ipsa moenia sunt,
civitas autem non saxa
sed habitatores vocantur”
T
he principle of Isidoro of Seville still preserves its force intact. The cities are
certainly of stone, wood, clay brick —today also of iron, glass or concrete—
but  in  essence  it  is  its  inhabitants  who  give  them  substance,  describes
them  and  characterizes  them.  Conceptually  this  binomial  “large  city-people”
must be understood in a diachronic dimension and of great amplitude. 
In  the  city,  we  are  not  only  fellow  citizen  of  our  contemporaries;  a  virtual
relationship is created and a bond that extends the centuries and the genera-
tions  that  unite  them.  If  this  was  not  so,  we  could  hardly  speak  of  tradition,
memory  and  civic  identity.  These  concepts  would  not  be  more  than  rhetorical
and formulations devoid of sense.
It  seems  that  today  we  all  agree:  historians,  philosophers,  sociologists,  and
architects on the unquestionable importance of the urban phenomenon. The mil-
lenarian vicissitudes of mankind, measures to the interior of the multiple experi-
ences of civility (civis = city) always appear marked by the presence of the urban
centers. And it seems that any complex social organization without its testimo-
ny  could  not  occur.  From  remote  times,  the  valleys  furrowed  by  rivers,  the  low
coasts, high plateaus and shallow lands (bajíos), have been the scenes of impor-
tant settlings. In them, the food production was organized, the labor division and
of  the  distribution  of  wealth  was  forged,  the  original  formulas  of  coexistence
were elaborated and conceived and power was organized and redefined.
Much  has  been  written  and  discussed  on  the  social-historical  morphology
and dynamics of the city, either to emphasize the planetary importance of the
