We cannot forget that the exhibition, fairs and conventions center, the Córdoba Biotech project that is finally underway, and the strengthening we are having in the Rabanales Technology Park with the arrival of Escribano, the activation of a new commercial park carries For the services sector to be reactivated and enlightened, it is not only an action that we do directly with them, but what it entails.

-What companies will soon announce your arrival in Córdoba?

-Now we have the arrival of Notary, with 40 initial jobs, an investment of 20 million and the next purchase of more land, or that commercial park that will generate more influx of people who come and consume in Córdoba, there are 10 million Of economic repercussion that CEFC has had, we are in a sweet moment, but we can never lower our guard. He is in the hands of the entrepreneur when to announce his arrival, we are working to create those bonds of approach to them, who see the local administration as a friend, an ally. There are contacts, nurseries spaces for the entrepreneur, companies of five or ten workers who need a first space and can have it with us.

"We want entrepreneurs to see the local administration as an ally"

-The ordinances and the tax descent will have something to do ...

-We Undoubtedly, budgets also enter here, which this City Council can say that it has an active local management from the first hour.

-How have the Cordoba of that descent benefited?

-Our objective is to continue with that fiscal decline, they are attractive to companies and investment, necessary for businessmen to breathe and function and in the end lead to that improvement in economic development that I think we are living in Córdoba. In general, it is the Cordoba who have been able to benefit, in this last ordinance it is when a first decrease in the Tax on Economic Activities (IAE), a wink and the first time that is collected. But not only is that, it is the attitude on the part of the local government so that logistics and technological innovations are spearhead of what Córdoba is, which is heritage, culture and it is a company, it will be our battle horse, it is my illusion and where we will reinforce.

-In the previous mandate there was a lot of delay in the budgets, it is understood that in this it should not happen since you have a majority ...

-The of this year will go through the Local Government Board and we will make the official presentation of the draft, but we will sit down to talk with the municipal opposition groups, even if we have that majority, which they also remind us. The Popular Municipal Group works in dialogue and listening because it is good, not only listening to our professionals and businessmen in the city, but also the opposition and what they see timely to transmit and see reflected in our budgets.

-What projects are in portfolio?

-We are elaborating all the corresponding sheetsCórdoba Biotech teeth that, as you know, is 80% co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund within the Plurirregional Operational Program of Spain Feder 2014-2020, we are preparing for the project to be totally city, there are very interested partners in the field National that will be part, we soon hope to announce those incorporations. Not only do we talk about technology or agriculture, it is health, which is very important because we have always been health ambassadors, we have to be inside and that Córdoba is an epicenter. We also talk about the agri -food project, Agrotech will take its impulse in this mandate and will join Córdoba Biotech, they will work close together. In the issue of entrepreneurship, a powerful network and impulse to show that strong Córdoba that the investor needs to see, never undermining public services, because they carry care of citizens.

-How is people explained then the rise in garbage and water?

-I would have to ask the central government because the rise we have of the fees, if the central government takes it away, we do not apply it, but if it imposes them we cannot not give quality services and work for citizens as they deserve, they are Some increases that are imposed.

-The paper of the IMDEEC for the Blet is important, at what point we are?

-The logistics base is important for what it represents in itself, those 1,600 jobs are very important, they are the epicenter of a great economic development for our city that will not only benefit those entrepreneurs, but it will reach the citizens Through talent. We have in Córdoba a great talent that we have to enhance and put at the service of the Blet and all the companies that we will be able to enjoy in Córdoba, as we are already seeing with a notary, the investment it has, the personnel that comes and the potentiality . All these companies need specific formations and from the Delegation of Economy and Employment we are working on these training packages to be able to give that possibility to our citizens.

"We have a very big enemy, the central government is undermining that being an entrepreneur is a problem, which is bad"

-How is the work of these training packages?

-In brief we are going to see the first news by the IMDEEC for those formations, we are working side by side with the Junta de Andalucía for that professional training and we will be able to announce the measures that are being carried out.

-Will this serve for young Cordoba to return to the city?

-The generational relay cannot be forgotten, they are key legs that are in our itinerary. There is a lot of interest in returning to Córdoba and many young people who are seeing the city as a possibility of work, but we need to show it, give them the opportunity to return or to come and the training will be very important.

-What is the vision of young people from the Cordoba business world?

-We have a very big enemy, the central government is undermining that being an entrepreneur is a problem, which is bad, it is a big problem for young people if we transmit that. When I talk about entrepreneurship and business world, very few young people raise their hands and say they want to undertake or be entrepreneurs, which is not easy, but there is nothing easy, and when you start throughTar with them do see a possibility and see something else. When you are an entrepreneur, you are because you want to get a personal dream, but because you know that it comes to society in many ways, business associations have a very powerful roots with social institutions and entities and we have not stopped working We need those entities, the businessman wants to be with them.

-How is this vision of entrepreneurship to change?

-What we are doing is working with professional training and with institutes, a very direct work, with training days where young people are finding possibilities, how to work on those attitudes, how to approach the business world. Enhance that direct relationship so that the students of the centers can be. The central branch is essential, to show new projects, which are fantastic, the logistics cluster will also have a lot of impact, a technology park that is being put at the forefront after so many years or Rabanales 21.

-What was pending of the previous mandate for this?

-It was the beginning and illusion makes everything increase. I believe that we did the tasks well, that we worked hard to show that our business fabric is important, it is powerful, it is there, not only in the social but socially. It is a productive fabric that in Covid times gave the face for the city and I think that what we work on was that knowledge and recognition of this fabric was seen. Now we are working to strengthen it, to improve it, to make everyone who comes has a welcome to a land that is not only culture and heritage, but also a company. Logistics and technology are essential.

"Our business fabric is important, it is powerful, it is there"

-What a few years can we say that Córdoba is also a business city?

-For that path we are going, I think it is already saying, the CEFC already begins to be a rival for other squares, always together with the Congress Palace of Torrijos Street, that we work together and hand in hand for that congressional tourism, that Economic and social impact that is so important, you cannot understand the economy of Córdoba if it is not understood that its impact falls into the social sphere, that is fundamental. I believe that we are achieving it, we are working on that aspect, in private public collaboration, that the business feels listening to the local administration.

-The opposition has criticized the management of CEFC and subsidies granted to make congresses there ...

-The opposition has to make its criticism, throw us from our ears, but should be measured and well worked. CEFC is positioning itself in the national and international environment in a very powerful way and should see it. It is important that they do not see it as a space for boasting of this local government, it is for the boast of all entrepreneurs, from commerce to artisans.

-Are there any project to activate a bus line that goes to CEFC?

-The level of lines we are in contact with Aucorsa, the congressmen and the City Council are working based on the needs. There are congresses that will comeCórdoba who will have concrete needs and Aucorsa will serve them. It is done in a timely manner, there is influx and contact with the taxis and the parking lot is there, but the most important thing is the apadero we need to stop the train, we want to take care of the infrastructure, but we need to facilitate power Open there and have the railways at the service of CEFC, that would be ideal. From the center of Córdoba there are four kilometers, only eight minutes, we cannot say that it is far from the city, it is part of it.

-What do you feel more proud so far in mandate?

-The first thing that comes to mind are our entrepreneurs, the professionals of Córdoba who day by day build city. I have to say that I feel very proud of our mayor, who has been the first mayor who puts Córdoba as a business, who puts our city at the head of many cities that will be ahead of business development. I think Córdoba can be proud of his mayor.
