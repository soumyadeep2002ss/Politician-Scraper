The Pontevedra PSOE revealed this Thursday the list with which it will attend - if you receive the approval of the party organs - to the municipal elections of May 28. The candidate, Iv√°n Puentes, presented the relationship to the Local Executive Committee and will now be sent to the Provincial Commission of List for its ratification.

As planned, Puentes and Councilor Yoya Blanco occupy the first two positions of the candidacy. The number 3 is for Manuel Fari√±a Casanova, 41, professor and secretary two IES Frei Mart√≠n Sarmiento. He currently also occupies the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Socialist Association of Pontevedra.

The obligation of the PSOE to make "zip lists" alternating men and women, relegates the current councilor of Benestar Social, Marcos Rey, at number 5. It is the same place he occupied in 2019, and although the PSOE obtained four ediles Rey ended Entering the corporation when giving up its acta Paloma Castro, which in 2020 was chosen parliamentary. Precisely, this repeats in the municipal candidacy the same since it occupied in 2019, the 4, which is theoretically a "exit" position, since four were the socialist mayor then and four is the result that is most repeated for the PSOE in the surveys that have been known so far.

In the number 6 of Carmen Hermo, artist and professor of drawing at the IES Frei Mart√≠n Sarmiento; and L 7 is for Guillerme P√©rez Agulla, director of Foundation Lu√≠s Tilve.
