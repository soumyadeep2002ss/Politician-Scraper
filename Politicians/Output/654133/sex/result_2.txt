Glad to organize this week at United Nations #UNGA with Heerad Sabeti, Michelle Muschett, Otto Scharmer, Jennifer Blanke, Ana Carolina Diaz and Max Kelly  this #UNGA high level roundtable on Realigning Development Finance with the SDGs Through Economic Systems Transformation.

Almost 50 leaders of government and philanthropy joined this 1st dialogue co-hosted by:
- Rania A. Al-Mashat, Egypt 
- B√•rd Vegar Solhjell  Norad - Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation 
- Lotte Machon, Denmark
- Erika Mouynes, Panama
- Larry Kramer and Brian Kettenring, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation 
- Heather Grady, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors 
- Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen, The LEGO Foundation 
- Heerad Sabeti, Fourth Sector Group 

The interlocking crises of climate, biodiversity, governance and inequality are consequences of outmoded economic systems that have prioritized financial performance at the expense of the well-being of people and the future of our planet. 

We must transition toward more inclusive, sustainable and resilient economic systems. Development finance has a critical role to play and we must take advantage of the different but also complementary and synergistic roles of governments and philanthropy to:
- fill the $3,7 trillion SDG finance annual gap, 
- to align all finance with the SDGs and 
- to support the economic systems transformation.

Stay tuned. More to come.

Just concluded a 5-days joint mission to the Middle-East with my colleague Sigrid Kaag (new Senior Humanitarian and  Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza).

I visited #Gaza and also had meetings in #Cairo, #Al-Arish, #Jerusalem and #Amman with Ministers, civil society and with my UNOPS team.

UNOPS  was recently assigned by United Nations SG Ant√≥nio Guterres to:
- support the operationalization of the Office of the new Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza; 
- and to operationalize and manage the new UN mechanism aiming to facilitate, coordinate, monitor, and verify humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza. 

Therefore, the purpose of this mission to #Gaza was quite clear: assess the challenges and identify potential operational solutions to increase #volume, #speed and #impact of aid into Gaza. 

I also had the chance to meet some colleagues of my courageous UNOPS team in Gaza and hear directly from them the challenges that have been facing. I want again to recognize their commitment and dedication as they continue to support the implementation of critical UNOPS  projects on the ground despite the severe conditions in Gaza.

In Gaza, the ability to deliver even basic aid has been decimated by intense hostilities, restrictions on movement, fuel shortages, and disruptions in communications.

Against unimaginable hardship, UNOPS is committed to staying and delivering for the people of Gaza, enabling access, enhancing security, and working towards sustainable peace and development.

I feel very honored to lead since April 2023 this fantastic UNOPS Team working in infrastructure, procurement and project management in more than 85 countries. 

Our role is particularly important in the most fragile and conflict-affected contexts.

I want to congratulate Sigrid Kaag for her appointment (following the recent approval of Security Council Resolution 2720) as United Nations Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza. Sigrid is the right person for this extremely difficult and important mission.

I also want to thank the UN SG Ant√≥nio Guterres for tasking UNOPS with the responsibility of:

- supporting the full operationalization of the Office of Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza and the establishment of the United Nations mechanism to facilitate, coordinate, monitor, and verify humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza.

The situation for humanitarian workers in #Gaza is beyond impossible. I can‚Äôt commend enough my amazing UNOPS Team in Gaza for their crucial role: 

- procuring and delivering fuel for health, clean water, telecommunications and food distribution; 

- supporting mine action; 

- and bringing mattresses, blankets, hygiene kits. 

But the population needs are much higher. 
As the United Nations SG Ant√≥nio Guterres has said, we are at a severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza and it is urgent to reach a humanitarian ceasefire.

A minha entrevista no P√∫blico conduzida pela jornalista Aline Flor.

O combate √†s altera√ß√µes clim√°ticas √© urgente, alcan√ß√°vel e proveitoso, gerando crescimento econ√≥mico e emprego. 

Mas n√£o vale a pena escamotear a verdade. Nesse processo de descarboniza√ß√£o teremos vencedores e vencidos e algumas actividades econ√≥micas e algumas empresas n√£o s√£o compat√≠veis com a trajet√≥ria para a economia verde e para a descarboniza√ß√£o. Ora, mais do que fazer disso um pretexto para adiar ou hesitar na ambi√ß√£o clim√°tica, compete aos Estados - sim, essa √© uma fun√ß√£o que se lhes exige- apoiar a reconvers√£o das atividades econ√≥micas obsoletas e a requalifica√ß√£o dos trabalhadores. 

Do mesmo modo, a transi√ß√£o justa exige solidariedade internacional. Nao se pode exigir aos pa√≠ses em desenvolvimento que esverdeiem os seus padr√µes de consumo e produ√ß√£o de energia, se tiverem de continuar a deparar-se - sem suficiente apoio internacional - com contextos de pobreza, desigualdade e fragilidade (2200 milh√µes de pessoas sem acesso a √°gua segura, 700 milh√µes sem acesso a eletricidade e 800 milh√µes em situa√ß√£o de pobreza extrema). √â no dom√≠nio da solidariedade e da coopera√ß√£o para o desenvolvimento que se joga o futuro da a√ß√£o clim√°tica.

 A narrativa de que as guerras e os conflitos dificultam o foco num combate ambicioso √†s altera√ß√µes clim√°ticas √© falsa. N√£o se trata de optar entre travar os conflitos e a mudan√ßa clim√°tica, at√© porque as duas quest√µes est√£o profundamente interligadas. Opini√£o de Jorge Moreira da Silva, Subsecret√°rio-geral da ONU e diretor executivo da UNOPS

The result was not perfect. But we can still consider it very positive. A real breakthrough.

First, nobody disputed the robustness of the Global Stocktake exercise. Facts are facts - and everyone is committed to rescuing the 1.5 degree target.

Second, instead of just asking countries to generally agree to new goals, there was a decision to focus on clear, specific steps to take action:
-Tripling renewable energy capacity globally by 2030;
-Doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030; 
-Accelerating the phase-down of all coal-fired power plants;
-Transitioning away from fossil fuels (first time that such a commitment was made). 
- Doubling finance to climate adaptation by 2025;
-And agreeing to define new commitments on climate finance by 2024. 

Finally, for the first time, climate justice received the highest attention. #COP28's focus on loss and damage was both significant and historic in this regard, with the operationalisation of the Loss & Damage Fund and with the operationalisation of the Santiago network. As you can imagine, I couldn't be happier with the decision taken at the COP28 to choose UNOPS  and United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) as the co-hosts of the Santiago Network, which is poised to play a key role in providing essential technical assistance and capacity building, tailored to the needs of the countries most affected by climate change.

With COP28 concluding, the need for immediate action stands out more strongly than before. 

In this critical point, we cannot afford to be complacent or hesitant. The urgency of climate action is not only a challenge but also a profound opportunity. We have the chance to transform this urgency into actionable, affordable solutions that can drive growth, create jobs, and promote greater equality.

UNOPS  - with its operational mandate and with its #GettingThingsDone culture - will continue supporting developing countries in this transition to a fairer, greener, safer world.

"Even though the final result did not reflect the urgency of the situation as much as needed, we can still consider it very positive."

Listen to UNOPS Chief Jorge Moreira da Silva's reflections on an historic result from #COP28.

At the Aqaba Process meeting, chaired by King Abdullah II, in Amman, we discussed concrete solutions to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza.
