VENICE AND THE VENETO 
DURING THE RENAISSANCE
THE LEGACY OF BENJAMIN KOHL
Benjamin G. Kohl (1938-2010) taught at Vassar College from 1966 till his
retirement as Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities in 2001.
His doctoral research at The Johns Hopkins University was directed by
Frederic  C.  Lane,  and  his  principal  historical  interests  focused  on
northern Italy during the Renaissance, especially on Padua and Venice.
His scholarly production includes the volumes Padua under the Carrara,
1318-1405(1998), and Culture and Politics in Early Renaissance Padua
(2001), and the online database The Rulers of Venice, 1332-1524(2009).
The database is eloquent testimony of his priority attention to historical
sources  and  to  their  accessibility,  and  also  of  his  enthusiasm  for
collaboration and sharing among scholars.
Michael Knaptonteaches history at Udine University. Starting from
Padua in the fifteenth century, his research interests have expanded
towards  more  general  coverage  of  Venetian  history  c.  1300-1797,
though focusing primarily on the Terraferma state.
John E. Lawteaches history at Swansea University, and has also long
served the Society for Renaissance Studies. Research on fifteenth-
century Verona was the first step towards broad scholarly investigation
of Renaissance Italy, including its historiography. 
Alison A. Smithteaches history at Wagner College, New York. A
dissertation on sixteenth-century Verona was the starting point for
research interests covering the social history of early modern Italy,
gender, urban elites, sociability and musical academies.
