Abstract 
 
 
This dissertation explores the use and dissemination of Aristotelian political theory in 
Italian literature from the late medieval period, when the first fragments of Aristotle’s 
political thought appeared in the West, to the sixteenth century, when vernacular 
Aristotelian literature flourished. I show how late medieval and Renaissance authors 
employed Aristotle’s Politics in various ways, according to their political background 
and allegiances, their approach to the text and their intended audience. I also 
demonstrate how, reciprocally, the vocabulary and classifications in the Politics shaped 
their understanding of their own political context.  
 
The thesis is divided into six chapters. The first chapter offers an overview, for 
comparative purposes, of the Latin and Greek reception of the Politics in Western 
Europe. The remaining chapters proceed chronologically. Chapter Two explores the 
place of the Politics in Italian vernacular literature of the late thirteenth and the 
fourteenth centuries. Chapter Three does the same for the fifteenth century, as well as 
considering the impact of Neo-Platonism and the ‘questione della lingua’ on vernacular 
political Aristotelianism.  
 
The three remaining chapters cover the sixteenth century. Chapter Four concerns 
Antonio Brucioli, who composed a series of Aristotelian political dialogues in the 1520s 
and in 1547 produced the first vernacular translation of the Politics. The subject of 
Chapter Five is Bernardo Segni, whose translation of the Politics, accompanied by the 
first full vernacular commentary, was published in 1549. Chapter Six deals with a 
representative selection of the wide-ranging vernacular material written on the Politics 
in the second half of the sixteenth century.  
 
The dissertation concludes with an evaluation of the changing uses of the Politics in 
Italy from the late thirteenth century to the end of the sixteenth, examining the different 
ways in which the treatise served as a key to understanding politics and political reality.
