Contribution to the Service Evolution Task for the Integration of the HF Radar (HFR) in the 
CMEMS INSTAC. 
x Team: two research engineers. 
x Role: member of the working team. 
x Methods: integration of quality-controlled Near Real Time (NRT) HFR data within the In Situ 
TAC products based on the INCREASE project recommendations. The performed activities 
aim to insure a realistic calendar to start the provision of NRT HFR data in April 2019. The firs
t 
task consists in organizing the Integration of the NRT HF Radar data in products such as Sea
-
In-Situ  Near  Real  Time  observations  for  first  integration  in  V5 according to the 
recommendations  produced  in  the  INCREASE  project.  These  include  the  delivery  o
f 
standardized data with RTQC procedures. The second task consists in the support of th
e 
implementation of the production of NRT Total and Radial velocities of surface current that wil
l 
be in place in a pre-operational mode in the INSTAC production unit for October 2018, and 
then delivered in V5 in April 2019 and V6 in April 2020.

Definition of data and metadata interoperable formats and QA/QC procedures to be adopted 
as European standards for coastal radar applications within Italian flagship project RITMARE, 
EU projects JERICO-NEXT, INCREASE (CMEMS) and SeaDataCloud (SDC), EuroGOOS HFR 
Task Team. 
x Team: three senior researchers, one technician and one research engineer. 
x Role: member of the working team. 
x Methods: definition of data and metadata formats compliant with CF-1.6, ACDD, Unidat
a 
Dataset  Discovery  and  INSPIRE  conventions.  Definition  of  QA/QC procedures:  Q
A 
procedures are based on IOOS best practices and QC methods are based on SNR, spatia
l 
geometry (GDOP) and statistics. The defined data and metadata formats and the QA/Q
C 
procedures are intended to be adopted as official European standards within the European 
HF Radar network and within the European services for delivery of NRT and historical HF
R 
data (CMEMS and SDC).

Sea surface current monitoring using High Frequency radar 
x Team: one senior researcher, one technician and one research engineer. 
x Role: member of the working team. 
x Methods:  development  of  a  control  software  tool  for  the  data  management,  from  data 
gathering at the sites to the final velocity data production. Realization of OGC complian
t 
interoperable data format architecture (netCDF based) and management of a THREDDS 
catalog for data visualization and access. 
The data produced by the system are processed for quality control through signal to nois
e 
ratio analysis and GDOP analysis. Technical reports and scientific papers (peer-review an
d 
conference proceedings) are produced.

x Methods: image processing, feature extraction, Machine Learning, feature elimination. 
The developed method is based on the Elastic Net Tikhonov Regularization method and i
t 
allows  for  the  training  of  predictive  models  for  gelatinous  zooplankton  identification. The 
generated  models  automatically  detect  gelatinous  zooplankton  specimens  in  underwate
r 
images. The validation of the models is made in a cross-validation framework based on 
ground truth datasets. Technical reports and scientific papers (peer-reviewed and conferenc
e 
proceedings) are produced.
