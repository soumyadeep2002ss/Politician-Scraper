20probably one of the sectors where developing countries have the highest competitive advantage and the one that allows them for a stronger participation in the global economy.
• A point in case is no doubt Cape Vert, Maldives and soon Samoa and the role that tourism has played in allowing these countries (SIDS) to be among the few that graduated or will graduate from the LDCs category.
• Addressing this challenge requires a better understanding of the impact and potential of tourism as a tool for development and a strong advocacy among decision markers as we need to strongly place tourism as one of the priorities in international development aid.
• In this regard, and though it’s clear much remain to be done, some key milestones have been reached:
– In 2011 Tourism was for the first time included in the LDCs agenda as part of the IPoA stemming from LD CIV in Istanbul;
– In 2012, for the first time tourism was included in the G20 Leaders Declaration as a sector fuelling jobs; and

– In 2012, a major milestone was achieved with the inclusion of two paragraphs on sustainable tourism in the Rio+20 Outcome document The Future We Want, including in the 10YFP on sustainable consumption and production.
– In 2013, in the 4th Global Aid for Trade Review, tourism has been identified by WTO and OECD, as one of the key 5 sectors with great potential for high impact through Connecting global firms through tourism value chains.
Dear Friends,
The recognition of the importance and potential contribution of tourism in national development strategies and in the global development agenda is becoming a reality. We must remember that meeting the needs of today’s tourists and host communities while protecting and enhancing opportunities for the future is key.
A heavy responsibility lies on our shoulders – tourism’s public and private sector decision makers. A responsibility to make sure that tourism and sustainability advance together hand in hand. And this responsibility – to reconcile economic, social and environmental ambitions –is being increasingly embraced by the tourism sector. This is being exemplified by the fact that this event is taking place.
As the leading organization for tourism, the World Tourism Organization endeavours to maximize tourism’s contribution to, inter alia, development and international understanding, while minimizing its negative impacts, paying particular attention to the growth potential of developing countries.
But we cannot achieve this mission alone.

Strategic Partnerships for Development, such as the Steering Committee on tourism for development and the Global Partnerships for sustainable tourism will be key framework for moving towards a collective action. The acceleration of the achievement of the MDGs, the Rio+20 implementation plan, the 10YFP and the post 2015 agenda with the SDGs represents a great opportunity for us to pursue our tourism advocacy efforts.
Yet, to achieve this objective, not only tourism should be placed higher in the development agenda and, but most importantly, the level of assistance in tourism should match the potential the sector has to contribute to the development objectives. Today, the tourism sector represents a mere 0.13 % of all Official Development Assistance (ODA) and 0.5% of Aid for Trade. Tourism should be an integral part of the current discussion in the context of Financing for Development.
When it comes to looking at result-based investment and aid efficiency in allocating Aid for development, it is essential to give developing countries the capacity to fully gain from the benefits the tourism sector offers, to build a better life for all within a people’s centered green development model.
We trust that this event will provide the basis for informed decisions on priorities and actions that need to be taken to ensure tourism’s ever growing contribution to the three dimensions of sustainable development – economic growth, social inclusion and environmental preservation - in line with our commitment to a better future.
