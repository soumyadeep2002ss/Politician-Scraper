The 15 most frequently asked questions by candidates for the Spanish citizenship test (CCSE)

1- What is the CCSE?

The “Constitutional and Sociocultural Knowledge of Spain Exam” (CCSE) evaluates the test taker’s knowledge of the constitution, society and culture of Spain. Passing the test is a legal requirement for all those who want to apply for Spanish citizenship.

2- When can I take the CCSE?

Official CCSE sessions are held on the last Thursday of every month, except in August and December, at the times set by the Instituto Cervantes.

3- Where can I take the CCSE?

You can take the CCSE in any of the exam centres officially recognised by the Instituto Cervantes, including Route 66 Idiomas. Our academy, located in the centre of Valencia and easily accessible by public transport, is the ideal place to take the exam as you’ll be in good hands and away from the crowds.

4- How can I register for the CCSE?

You have to register for the exam and pay the exam fee online at examenes.cervantes.es

Although the registration process is fairly simple, you can read our step-by-step Guide to registering for the Spanish nationality exam with Route 66 Idiomas (in Spanish).

5- How much does it cost to take the exam?

The CCSE registration fee is €85 (eighty-five euros) and is the same wherever you take the test.

Paying the exam fee is the last step in the registration process and must be completed on the official website: examenes.cervates.es

6- How long does the exam last?

The exam lasts for 45 minutes but most candidates finish before the time is up.

7- What mark do you need to pass the CCSE?

The result of the exam is PASS or FAIL. To pass you must answer 15 or more questions correctly out of the 25 questions on the exam.

If they receive a FAIL or ABSENT grade, a candidate will be able to sit the exam a second time at no extra cost. To do so, the candidate must select the resit option in their online profile.

8- When will I get the result of my nationality exam?

About 20 days after the exam, the Instituto Cervantes will notify all candidates that the results have been published. Once candidates have received this email, they should access their online profile/user area at examenes.cervantes.es where they will find their result.

9- Once I’ve passed the exam, can the result expire?

Yes. A CCSE pass grade is valid for 4 years from the date it is issued. Consequently, it should be used to apply for Spanish citizenship before this 4-year period is over.

10- Do I have to take the CCSE?

There are some Spanish citizenship applicants who do not have to take the CCSE. These are:

Minors.
Those with modified legal capacity.
People with learning difficulties (accreditation must be given to the Ministry of Justice)
People who have attended school in Spain and completed their obligatory secondary education in the country.
Those with Sephardic origin who are over 70 years old.

Those who do not know how to read or write must request a partial dispensation from the Ministry of Justice which they will later have to show to the exam centre so they can take the CCSE orally. Said dispensation must be shown to the exam centre as far in advance of the exam as possible.

11- Can I change the exam centre or exam date I’ve chosen?

Yes, you can change the place and date of the exam you’ve chosen as long as the registration dates for the relevant sessions are still open (both the exam you want to change and the new exam session you want to select must both be open to registrations) and the examination centre you want has places available.

12- What are the questions on the Spanish nationality exam like?

The exam is made up of 25 questions about Spanish government, legislation, citizen participation, culture, history and society. There is only one correct answer to each question.

Here are some example questions:

13- Where can I study for the exam? Is there a preparatory textbook?

Every year the Instituto Cervantes puts together a free manual which includes all the questions which could appear on the paper on the day of the CCSE. You can download this manual from the Instituto Cervantes’ website and it is also available on our website: DOWNLOAD CCSE 2023 MANUAL NOW.

You can also download a free app for mobile phones which will help you prepare for the test.

14- What documents do I need to take with me to the exam session?

If the candidate is applying for citizenship due to permanent residency in Spain, they must take:

Candidates who are citizens of non-EU countries
Registration receipt received via email.
Original passport.
Original, valid TIE (NIE card).

 

Candidates who are citizens of EU member states
Registration receipt received via email.
Original passport.
Original, valid TIE (NIE card), or identity document from their country of origin.

 

If the candidate is applying for citizenship due to Sephardic origins, they must take:

Registration receipt received via email.
Original passport.
Original, valid identity document from their country of residence, if this is outside of the European Union, or their original, valid TIE if they are resident in Spain.

 

15- What do I have to do to take the exam a second time?

Candidates will have to take their resit at the same exam centre where they first sat the exam. They must take the exam for the second time within a maximum of 18 months from the date of the first exam.

This second chance will be available to candidates who have received a FAIL grade in their first sitting or those who did not attend their first sitting.

You cannot request a second sitting until the grades from the first sitting you registered for have been published. In other words, you will have to wait at least 3 weeks after the date of your first exam to be able to register for a resit.
