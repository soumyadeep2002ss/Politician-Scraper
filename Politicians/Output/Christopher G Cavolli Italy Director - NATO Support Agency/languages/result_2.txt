There is something about the picture of General Cavolli that strikes me. His apparent humility. Most generals wear as many as eight rows of medals, some truly earned but most gratuitously given to generals while the valor of enlisted men and junior officers is overlooked. Gen. Cavolli wears three medals, The Defense and Army Distinguished Service Medals and Legion of Merit. All well earned. His Airborne wings, Ranger tab and Combat Infantry Badge tell the most important story of his contributions to our country.

I don't know if Chris Cavoli rmembers me from the good old days in Garmisch, where we both served at the College of International Security Studies of GCMC
. Anyway, I wish you all the best. NATO  will be lucky to have you at this formidable position.

Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and General Manager of the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) Stacy Cummings concluded contracts for $1.2 billion in artillery ammunition.

“This demonstrates that NATO’s tried and tested structures for joint procurement are delivering,” said the Secretary General. “Russia’s war in Ukraine has become a battle for ammunition, so it is important that Allies refill their own stocks, as we continue to support Ukraine.”
