0Opposition was, however, unrelenting, as it continued shouting slogans, demanding that the CM as well as other two ministers - Ashok Choudhary and Mukesh Sahni - be moved out of the House during voting despite Manjhi’s continued insistence that Kumar was present in the capacity of the leader of the House only. Choudhary and Sahni are not members of any House at present.

The Leader of Opposition, however, said that the rules were being violated right in the presence of the Pro-tem Speaker. “They stole the mandate in 2015 and have again done it. Now, it is happening before the chair. It is a mockery of democracy,” he added, while the opposition members sat in the well.

In the midst of the din, with the opposition unmoved, Manjhi again read out the motion for election of Sinha as the Speaker once again and asked those in favour to stand up for counting. “Your disruption is meaningless and clearly shows that you have some weakness and are trying to stall proceedings. If you have the numbers, go back to your seats and be counted. If you have the numbers, that will show. I have clearly said that those not members of the House would not vote, but they could remain present,” he added.

Despite counting those in favour of the motion for Sinha’s election, the Opposition remained unmoved, disregarding the Chair’s repeated requests to get back to their seats. Later, Manjhi adjourned the House for five minutes.

As soon as the House reassembled, Ajit Sharma urged the Chair for an attendance register, as some outside members were also present, but Manjhi rejected it and ordered those in favour of the motion to stand up once again for counting. Tejashwi Yadav tried to question the presence of the CM, but Manjhi reiterated that he was there as leader of the House.

Later, the Speaker asked those against the motion to stand up for counting. After the counting, the Opposition was again in the well, shouting slogans. Manjhi urged the opposition members to get back to their seats for announcement of results.

Constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap, too, later said that there was nothing wrong in the presence of the CM in the House and the ruling of the Speaker was paramount. “Such things have happened in the past also, but this is the first time such a demand has been raised. The leader of the House can remain present in the House. It appears clearly a political move,” Kashyap added.

The NDA commands 125 members plus it has the support of an independent and the lone member of the LJP. The RJD, with 110 members, was hoping that ‘conscience voting’ will tilt the scale in its favour. The AIMIM’s stand that the Speaker should be a unanimous choice also dampened the opposition alliance’s prospects.
