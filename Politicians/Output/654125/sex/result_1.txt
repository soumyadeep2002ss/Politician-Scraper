#JFTC members joined International #DenimDay to show support and solidarity with victims of sexual harassment. Together with US NATO Brigade we are celebrating this day today, five days prior to its official date (29 April), wearing blue jeans.

29 April is known as International Denim Day. The US Army stands with the international community to recognize this day to raise awareness of sexual violence and victim blaming. This campaign began after a ruling by the Italian Supreme Court where a rape conviction was overturned because the justices felt that since the victim was wearing tight jeans she must have helped the person who raped her remove her jeans, thereby implying consent. The following day, the women in the Italian Parliament came to work wearing jeans in solidarity with the victim. As the longest running sexual violence prevention and education campaign in history, Denim Day asks community members, elected officials, businesses and students to make a social statement through fashion by wearing jeans on this day as a visible means of protest against the misconception that surround sexual violence.
