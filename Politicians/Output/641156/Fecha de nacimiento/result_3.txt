The Spanish Habsburgs and 
Dynastic Rule, 1500–1700
Providing  a  novel  research  methodology  for  students  and  scholars  with  an  
interest in dynasties, at all levels, this book explores the Spanish Habsburg 
dynasty that ruled the Spanish monarchy between c. 1515 and 1700.
Instead of focusing on the reigns of successive kings, the book focuses on 
the Habsburgs as a family group that was constructed in various ways: as a 
community of heirs, a genealogical narrative, a community of the dead and a 
ruling family group. These constructions reflect the fact that dynasties do not 
only exist in the present, as kings, queens or governors, but also in the past, 
in genealogies, and in the future, as a group of hypothetical heirs.
This book analyses how dynasties were ‘made’ by the people belonging to 
them.  It  uses  a  social  institutionalist  framework  to  analyse  how  family  dy-
namics gave rise to practices and roles. The kings of Spain only had limited 
power to control the construction of their dynasty, since births and deaths, 
processes  of  dynastic  centralisation,  pressure  from  subjects,  relatives’  indi-
vidual  agency,  rivalry  among  relatives  and  the  institutionalisation  of  roles  
limited their power.
Including several genealogical tables to support students new to the Span-
ish Habsburgs, this book is essential reading for all students of early modern 
Europe and the history of monarchy.
