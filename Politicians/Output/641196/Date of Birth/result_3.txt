ABOUT US

The Spanish Desalination and Reuse Association (AEDyR) was created in 1998 following the enormous interest in Spanish desalination technology around the world, as a result of the International Desalination and Reuse Association (IDRA), formerly known as IDA, Congress held in Madrid at the end of 1997.

Given the technological level and the references of the Spanish desalination market at the IDRA Congress held in San Diego (California) in 1999, AEDyR was admitted as a full member with the same status as other associations of continental scope, such as the European Desalination Society and the American Desalination Association.

The aim of the Association, as stated in its statutes, is “to promote the appropriate use of seawater and brackish water desalination and the reuse of reclaimed wastewater, thereby contributing to the sustainable management of water resources”. To this end, it carries out a series of activities, among which we would highlight its congresses. They are important meeting points for the sector and for the dissemination of research and technological innovations, as well as training and preparation activities for technicians.

Throughout its history, AEDyR has had three presidents: José Antonio Medina (1997-2009), Manuel Rubio (2009-2014) and Domingo Zarzo, who assumed this position in 2014. Medina combined his presidency in AEDyR with the presidency in IDRA from 2005 to 2007. In addition, a member of the AEDyR Board of Directors, Miguel Ángel Sanz, has also been president of IDRA (2017-2019).

The aim of AEDyR is to promote the appropriate use of desalination and water reuse, contributing to the sustainable management of water resources.

In the year 2000, AEDyR organised its first national congress in Murcia, which at the beginning has an annual periodicity. From 2004 the event becomes biennial and from 2012 it becomes international, evolving to its present status as one of the biggest events focused on desalination and water reuse held in Europe.

AEDyR also periodically organises technical conferences. These events are eminently technical on different topics of interest to our members in which the latest technological, commercial and research innovations are presented.

In addition, AEDyR is committed to training since its inception. From 2001 to 2013, intensive courses have been given every two years. From 2014, the Association promotes and actively participates in the official online course of Specialist in Desalination and Water Reuse that is held annually by the University of Alicante.

AEDyR, with its nearly 300 members, brings together practically all the companies in the sector and public institutions in Spain with an interest in the field of desalination and reuse: construction companies, engineering firms, manufacturers, universities, research centres and public administrations.

Since its foundation, AEDyR has actively maintained collaborations and agreements with other national and international private and public organisations in the water, desalination and reuse sector in matters related to research, development, good practices and efficient use of energy.

AEDyR intends to represent everyone, i.e. construction companies, engineering companies, service companies, manufacturers, universities and research centres, public administrations, and any person who individually wishes to be in contact with this industry.
