Amparo Folgado Tonda, Mayor of Torrent

Dear citizens,



It is for me a pleasure to welcome the web portal of the City of Torrent, capital of L’orta Sud, as mayor of this great city.



In this space we want to offer you access to all the information, administrative, citizen, tourist and interest so that you can enjoy your experience with torrent, either for reasons of an inexcusable nature, as official procedures or procedures, or more informally , to consult any data or information from our city.

Our vocation is to cover, in the most appropriate and complete way possible, the needs that each citizen has, so we aspire to turn this website again into a reference of smart cities. A resource in which the citizen can access and connect immediately with his town hall, which can know and use all the services we put available to his hand.



A large city is not only defined by a title, but for everything that it does for its citizens and what they expect, so this website also intends to be the perfect tool for citizens to transfer their concerns, complaints or suggestions. The way of knowing from the Consistory the reality and day to day of our city.



This, and much more, offers the municipal website, with a main objective: to enhance the possibilities and strengths of our city. A city with history, heritage and open to all, in continuous expansion and progress, which offers all kinds of services and in an ideal site for investment and generation of wealth.

In short, our claim as a government team isOffer an effective, participatory and transparent portal to all citizens. And I invite you all to enter it, make the most of all the functionalities it provides and to connect with the most digital torrent.

Write to the mayor
