OCCULTISM AND MEDIUMSHIP IN FERNANDO PESSOA

Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)

Alisson DiÃªgo Dias de Medeiros

2016-03-01

Full Text Available This work is the result of a research on the influence that the occultism had on the work of the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa. To delimitate the study, we selected papers of Fernando Pessoa, which Â suggested that the poet considered himself medium, and hence influenced his work, building his depersonalization. This work presents, thus, as main objectiveto analyze personal papers of Fernando Pessoa, whose outstanding characteristic is the presence of occultism and the supposed mediumship defended by him in response to non-literary and heteronymic manifestations. To this end, I focused on specific objectives, which are: a to study the speech of Fernando Pessoa on his supposed mediumship / occultism b to analyze specific texts that are, for the poet, mediumistic manifestations c to study excerpts from a set of personal letters in which Fernando Pessoa suggested being a medium. It is true that this dissertation will address many discussions already made by scholars and specialists in Fernando Pessoa, but we consider the possibility to deepen issues and contribute to the critical fortune of the poet.

Testing the three axis magnetometer and gradiometer MOURA and data comparison on San Pablo de los Montes Observatory.

A magnetometer and gradiometer named MOURA has been developed with the objective to measure the magnetic field on Mars in the frame of Mars MetNet Precursor Mission (MMPM) [1]. MOURA is a compact, miniaturized, intelligent and low cost instrument, based on two sets of triaxial magnetometers separated one centimeter from each other to do gradiometry studies. It has a resolution of 2.2 nT, and a field range of + 65Î¼T, which can be extended to +130 Î¼T when sensors are saturated. [2] These sensor heads are Anisotropic MagnetoResistances (AMR) Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) by Honeywell, specifically HMC1043, which has been selected due to their relative low consumption, weight and size, factors very important for the mission with very limited mass and power budget (shared 150 g for three full payloads). Also, this technology has been previously successfully employed on board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to perform geomagnetic surveys in extreme conditions areas [3], and in severalspace missions for different applications. [4] After the development of the MOURA Engineering Qualification Model (EQM) in November 2011, an exhaustive set of tests have been performed to validate and fully characterize the instrument. Compensation equations have been derived for the temperature corrections in the operation range (between -135 Â°C and 30 Â°C) in controlled environments. These compensation equations have been applied to field data, which have shown to follow the daily Earth's magnetic field variations as registered by San Pablo Geomagnetic Observatory (IAGA code: SPT) (available at www.ign.es and www.intermagnet.org) with deviations lower than 40 nT. These deviations were attributed to several error factors as the different locations between MOURA and SPT and other possible different geomagnetic conditions. Due to the above, a measurement campaign on SPT installations are been done. The main objective is to compare MOURA measurements on a relevant environment, with data

Didelphidae marsupials (Mammalia, Didelphimorphia from the Late Pleistocene deposit of the Gruta dos Moura Cave, northern Brazil

Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)

Patricia Villa Nova

2015-03-01

Full Text Available The present study acknowledges the diversity of fossil marsupials from the Gruta dos Moura cave, as well as environmental and climatic aspects during the Quaternary. The results show that this is the largest diversity of Pleistocene marsupials recorded in a single cave: Didelphis albiventris, D. aurita, Gracilinanus agilis, G. microtarsus, Marmosa murina, Monodelphis brevicaudata, M. domesticaand Sairadelphys tocantinensis. Furthermore, the described specimens are also part of the only fossil assemblage unequivocally referable to the late Pleistocene. Paleontological studies suggest an intimate association with dry and open environments with high abundance of water sources. Since most of the identified taxa are characteristic of open forests and gallery forests, this could represent the actual environment around the Gruta dos Moura cave. Recent studies identified sympatric occurrences between species from open and dry environments and species from humid forests that were identified among our material and are characteristic of humid regions. Therefore, these species could inhabit gallery forests and capons, or even ecotones, inside a dry and open environment. Moreover, the extinction of Sairadelphyscould also indicate that the climatic and environmental conditions changed or that the past environment was more heterogeneous than the current environment of the region.

Moura tragedy the model for this year's underground exercise

Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)

1991-10-01

Mines Rescue teams in the 1991 E.K. Healy cup competition handled an underground exercise based on the Moura No. 4 colliery explosion which killed 12 miners on July 16, 1986. The contest organisers and hosts went to great lengths to achieve realism. This included underground water barriers and ventilation tubes being tossed around, meat, offal and bullock's blood being strewn and using trickel dusters to produce a smoke effect restricting visibility to 20 metres. The other exercises in the contest were: a theory test; and exercise involving gas monitoring, power isolation and fire fighting; and a first aid section dealt with an electrical accident near water. The task in the underground exercise was to retrieve information. The Chairman of the Assessors reported that the theory and fire fighting were handled fairly well. Handling of the electrical incident was not too bad, with the life saving techniques being very well done. The underground exercise revealed different ways of gathering information. While leadership styles and team member interaction varied this was not detrimental to efficiency. 9 photos.

Objective: To observe the effect of CD34 cord blood stem cell transfected by plasmid vector plRES2-FL-IL-3 on the mouse after irradiation and to investigate its mechanisms. Methods: In the co-expressed group (12 mice), CD 34 + cord blood stem cells were transfected by plasmid vector pIRES2-FL-IL-3.5 x lO 5 cells were injected intravenously in the mouse. The hemogram changes in mice were detected 2, 4 and 6 weeks after radiation. At 6 weeks after irradiation, the expression of the CD 34 in spleen was detected by immumofluorescence method. The mRNA level and the activity of IL-3 and FL were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Other 3 groups were CD 34 + cell group (CD 34 group), pIRES2-IL-3 group(IL 3 group) and pIRES2-FL group(FL group), and there were 12 mice in each group. Results: The survival rate of CD 34 group, IL3 group and FL group at the 6th week were 25.0% (3/12), 50.0% (6/12) and 50.0% (6/12), respectively. It was 91.7% (11/12) in the co-expressed group, which was higher than those in the other groups. The expression of the CD 34 of spleen in the co-expressed group was higher than those of the other groups. The mRNA level and the activity of IL-3 and FL of spleen in the co-expressed group were higher than those in the other groups too. Conclusions: The CD 34 '+ cord blood stem cells transfected by plasmid vector pIRES2-FL-IL-3 have hemogenesis promotion effect on the mice after irradiation, which was related with the aggregation, proliferation of stem cells and the high expression of the interest proteins..

Fernando Zamora: un poeta raro

Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)

JuliÃ¡n Alonso

2014-03-01

Full Text Available Fernando Zamora no es solo un poeta que pinta o un pintor que escribe, sino un creador en el mÃ¡s amplio sentido de la palabra, un espÃ­ritu libre y fronterizo que no se deja influenciar por los clichÃ©s al uso en cuanto a lo que es y no es Arte, ni por la obsesiva sistematizaciÃ³n que de las diferentes disciplinas trata de establecer la crÃ­tica tradicional. Fernando Zamora pinta, escribe, pasea, reflexiona pero es mucho mÃ¡s que eso, porque no se entenderÃ­a el todo sin sus partes. Para inspirarse necesita pasear, recorrer campo y caminos, alejarse de la civilizaciÃ³n pero para completar su tarea tambiÃ©n precisa regresar a territorio conocido y pisar tierra firme, por mÃ¡s que vuelva siempre cargado de ideas y objetos perdidos o desahuciados. Transita por la frontera, a veces de un lado, a veces del otro, las mÃ¡s con un pie en cada orilla, y asÃ­ surgen unas obras que pocas veces podemos â€”ni Ã©l mismo puedeâ€” determinar a quÃ© territorio pertenecen, pero ahÃ­ estÃ¡n, afirmando su existencia y la de su creador, un poeta raro, sin duda, pero tambiÃ©n un artista con mAyã.
