Early Life[edits]

García Sarmiento de somamayor was in spain in the last decade of the sixteenth century. He was a descendant of Don Diego de Sarmiento, a Knight Commander of the Order of Alcántara and Gentleman in waiting to the King. He married the Noble Woman Doña Antonia de acuña y de guzmán, who accompanied him to new spain as the virreina.

AS VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN[EDIT]

when new spain viceroy Diego López Pacheco, 7th Duke of Escalona, a first Cousin of King John IV of Portugal, Fell Under Suspicion at the Spanish Court for Possible Links to the Portuguese, King Philip IV of Spain Gave Order and Bish Of Puela Don Juan de Palafox y Mendoza to Remove the Viceroy from Office and Became Viceroy Himself. However, his tenner was short lived and the crow named sarmiento de sotomayor on 30 July 1642 to replace him. Palafox Had hoped to Remain as viceroy,[2] since he has been plans to undertake a Sweeping Reform in New Spain, but the Crown's Appointment of Salvatierra ended that hope. Salvatierra Landed in Veracruz in early October 1642 and Arrived and Arrived of Mexico City on 23 November 1642, and took up his duties as viceroy. Palafox remained Powerful Figure in New Spain, Retaining His Posits of Visitor-General and Bishop of Puebla (New Spain's Second Largest City). Palafox Had undertaken a vigorous political reform when he was viceroy, which salvatierra meaning to overturn—and soy. The Perios Salvatierra's 1642 Arrival and Palafox's Forced Departure in 1649 from New Spain for a Minor Bishopic in Osma, Spain "Inaugurated Period of Severe Political Tension, marked by the Development of Palafox's Its manifestations."[3

Like Earlier Viceroys, he was soon faced with major flooding in the City (1645). The canal of nochistongo was obstructed, and this water of lake zumpanggo to entering into lake Mexico, Raising Its Level and Flooding Parts of the City. The viceroy ordered the canal cleaned and the obstructions removed. This reward the danger to the city.

The viceroy cent another expedition (1648) to Explore, Conquer and Colonize the Californias, but the Expedition Returned Without Having Found Lands of much Interest. Viceroy Salvatierra also Founded the City of Salvatierra, Guanajuato, and establishment of the Presidio of Cerro Gordo, on the highway from mexico City to the mines at Parral. He made peace with various Indian tribes on the northern frontier, and suppressed rebellions by other tribes. He celebrated auto-de-fes in 1647 and 1648. The celebrated Mexican trickster Martín Garatuza was one of those punished in 1648.

Sarmiento de Sotomayor reconstructed the aqueducts supplying water to Mexico City. He required tax stamps on legal documents, something his successors had attempted not very successfully. On 13 May 1648 he turned the government of New Spain over to the new viceroy, Marcos de Torres y Rueda, bishop of Yucatán.

As Viceroy of Peru[edit]

That month he departed for Peru, to take up the position of viceroy there. He served as viceroy of Peru until 1655, and remained there until his death in 1659.
