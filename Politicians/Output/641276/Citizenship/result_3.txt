ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY
It is the policy of the Latin American Studies 
Association (LASA) that all participants in 
LASA activities will enjoy an environment free 
from all forms of discrimination, harassment, 
and retaliation. As a professional society, 
LASA is committed to providing an 
atmosphere that encourages the free 
expression and exchange of scholarly ideas. 
In pursuit of that ideal, LASA is dedicated to 
ensuring equality of opportunity and 
treatment for all members, regardless of 
gender, gender identity or expression, race, 
color, national or ethnic origin, religion or 
religious belief, age, marital status, sexual 
orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or any 
other reason not related to scientific merit. 
Harassment of colleagues, students, or other 
conference participants undermines the 
principle of equality at the heart of these 
professional fora and is inconsistent with the 
principles of free inquiry and free expression. 
Harassment, sexual or otherwise, is a form of 
misconduct that undermines the integrity of 
LASA meetings and events and is considered 
by LASA to be a serious form of professional 
misconduct. Participants who violate this 
policy will be subject to appropriate 
disciplinary measures. 
LASA Anti-Harassment Policy 
The following Anti-Harassment Policy 
outlines expectations for all members of the 
Latin American Studies Association (LASA), 
including those who serve in elected or 
appointed positions. It reminds all members, 
and especially those serving in key roles in 
the Association, that all professional 
academic ethics and norms apply as 
standards of behavior and interaction in the 
course of LASA-related activities. 
1. Purpose 
LASA is committed to providing a safe and 
welcoming environment for all members and 
staff, free from harassment, bullying, 
discrimination, and violence based on age, 
race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, 
language, sexual orientation, gender identity 
or gender expression, disability, health 
conditions, socioeconomic status, marital 
status, domestic status, or parental status 
(hereafter, simply harassment). LASA 
recognizes that there is a distinction between 
victimization through harassment and 
legitimate, justifiable, and appropriate 
constructive criticism. Nothing in this 
document shall be construed as a limitation 
on the ability of LASA members to evaluate 
and critique the merit of one another’s work.
2. Expected Behavior 
All members of LASA, especially those in 
leadership roles as described above, are 
expected to abide by this Anti-Harassment 
Policy in all meeting venues, including 
ancillary events as well as official and 
unofficial social gatherings, and in the course 
of LASA activities outside of Congresses and 
Section events, as well as EC and other 
meetings. 
LASA members are expected to follow the 
norms of professional respect that are 
necessary to promote the conditions for free 
academic interchange. If you witness 
conduct directed towards a Congress or 
meeting participant, be proactive in helping to 
stop that conduct or limit its effect. LASA 
members are expected to alert conference 
security personnel or law enforcement if they 
see a situation in which someone might be in 
physical danger.
3. Unacceptable Behavior 
Harassment consists of a singleintense and 
severe act, or multiple persistent or pervasive 
acts, which are demeaning, abusive, 
offensive, or create a hostile professional or 
workplace environment. Harassment may 
include unwelcome sexual solicitation or 
physical advance which involves an 
expressed or implied reward for compliance 
or threat of reprisal for refusing to comply, or 
verbal or non-verbal conduct that is sexual in 
nature, thereby creating what reasonably may 
be perceived as a hostile or intimidating 
environment; it may also include threatening, 
intimidating, or hostile acts; circulation of 
written or graphic material that denigrates or 
shows hostility toward an individual or group; 
epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping based 
on group identity. The purposeful exclusion of 
a person who is a member of a decision-
making committee such as but not limited to 
executive council, section, nominations 
committee, award committee, etc. through 
misinformation, isolation, and lack of 
communication about matters in which that 
person should be included based on their 
official or designated role may also constitute 
harassment.
4. Addressing Grievances 
Complaints about unacceptable behavior at 
the LASA Congress or any other EC activity 
should follow the “Procedures for Violations 
of LASA’s Anti-Harassment Policy”. Affected 
members can contact any of the following 
LASA officials: 
LASA Ombudsperson 
A team of two LASA Ombudspersons will be 
recruited among qualified members of LASA. 
One of the Ombudspersons will identify as a 
woman, the other as a man. One will be 
based in Latin America, the other from any of 
the other regions in which LASA has 
members. Once the Ombudspersons are 
recruited, their appointments will be subject 
to approval by two-thirds of the Executive 
Council. The ombudspersons are available 
for confidential consultation about concerns 
related to harassment in violation of this 
policy, but play no role in addressing of 
alleged violations of LASA’s Anti-Harassment 
Policy.
Policy Advisor 
A trained staff member who can provide 
detailed information about the options for 
pursuing a formal harassment complaint. See 
“Procedures for Violations of LASA’s Anti-
Harassment Policy”.
