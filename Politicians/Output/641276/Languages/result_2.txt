Solving the "Billable-Hour Burnout" problem üî• | Big 4 Auditor turned Burnout Coach + Speaker | Empowering accountants, lawyers + consultants to have the career + at-home life they want without the stress üëãüèºüíÅüèª‚ôÄÔ∏è

‚Å†Do you speak another language (or perhaps even two)? ‚Å†
‚Å†
I always found other languages fascinating.‚Å†
‚Å†
As a child, I used to write down the Spanish words and phrases Ricky Ricardo spoke in "I Love Lucy"‚Å†. ‚Å†
‚Å†
In college, I studied abroad in Madrid, Spain, embedding myself deeply into Spanish culture. (Enjoy the throwback photo :) )‚Å†
‚Å†
After that experience, I continued to study Spanish however I could. I didn't have funds to triple-major, but I chose to "audit" Spanish classes to keep the language fresh. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Until I started my first full time job... ‚Å†
‚Å†
Sadly, I no longer practiced Spanish after graduating college. I thought I had to give up on the things I love to do well in my career. ‚Å†
‚Å†
I got especially rusty during my burnout days. No surprises there. ‚Å†üôÑ‚Å†
‚Å†
During my career, I once applied for a secondment in Buenos Aires, but my Spanish wasn't fluent enough to qualify.‚Å†
‚Å†
Disappointing, but it never stopped me. ‚Å†
‚Å†
I decided to keep it alive when I travel. I've returned to Spain several times travel to Central and South America to keep my proficiency alive. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Today I'm leaving for an adventure vacation to Chile where I'll be practicing my love of the Spanish language as I hike through beautiful Patagonia. ‚Å†
‚Å†
Even the hotel's customer service team knew I was excited to practice Spanish. They sent me a list of Chilean slang. :)‚Å†
‚Å†
Which language(s) do you speak? What do you love most about speaking another language? Share your thoughts in the comments below. ‚§µÔ∏è‚Å†

I studied Spanish for 6 years but never had the opportunity to use it. I recently started learning Swahili as Zanzibar is on my bucket list!

I often talk to women about the challenges they face in today‚Äôs workforce and one stands out pretty clear: 
¬†
It‚Äôs lonely at the top.
¬†
As part of my mission to support the hardest-working women, I‚Äôm creating the community I wish existed. 

This is the first of many, but I invite you to join the üéâ inaugural virtual networking eventüéâ¬†to build valuable and authentic relationships, tap into new resources, and expand your customer base/referral sources.

üìÖ¬†WHEN: February 23th, 2023 @ 12:30-1:30PM ET

DAY 5/5: You are responsible for your unhappiness.‚Å†
‚Å†
As I reflect on this experience 11 years later, I blamed my circumstances for my unhappiness--an inconsiderate manager, weekly travel to the coldest city in the US, and having no time for me. ‚Å†‚Å†
Making matters worse, I tortured myself by cutting-out the people and things I loved. ‚Å†
‚Å†
It was a toxic relationship AND I had more control than I thought.


üî∑WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE TO PREVENT BURNOUT?üî∑‚Å†
‚Å†
So many things, but here's a short list:‚Å†
‚Å†
1. Said "NO" more. ‚Å†
My trip to the ER started years prior. I was taught that the path to success was based on saying YES to everyone, working the longest and pushing the hardest. I was wrong. I should have embraced boundaries sooner.

2. Been more aware of my body. ‚Å†
To suppress any aches and pains in the months leading up to the ER, I took pills/goops/creams to alleviate physical and mental discomfort. Instead, I should have paid more attention to the ‚Äúhow,‚Äù ‚Äúwhen,‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of my symptoms. ‚Å†

‚Å†3. Asked for help sooner. ‚Å†
After my burnout episode, I went into a downward spiral, thinking I wasn't smart enough or good enough. And because I thought "I had to solve for it on my own" it took me years to fully recover. I should have hired a coach, mentor and/or therapist earlier than I did.

‚Å†4. Found a community where I could be authentically me.
This one is BIG. In a mostly male-dominated field, it can feel like you're not seen or heard. And for women leaders, it's especially lonely... but not anymore.

üí•I've been promising a little surprise, and here it is. üí•

Next Friday, 2/23 from 12:30-2PM ET, I'm hosting a virtual networking event for the hardest-working women. This is an opportunity to meet, connect and authentically build community. 

Register now by using the link in my profile!

Here we are, 11 years later. I share this story to prevent other women accountants, attorneys and consultants from having the same fate (or worse). ‚Å†
‚Å†
If I can offer one thing: learn from my story and don't let it become yours.‚Å†
‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†
The best time to work on your burnout? Years ago.‚Å†
‚Å†
The second best time? Today. ‚Å†

Take action now.

Have you ever tried cleaning your house, and mid-way in you look around and everything‚Äôs a complete mess?

This sentiment was the equivalent step in my burnout journey. 

Life felt messy and hard... AND it was where the work actually began.

PS Have a read and be on the lookout for tomorrow's post. I have a little surprise for you. :)

And just when I thought it was over, it was only beginning...
