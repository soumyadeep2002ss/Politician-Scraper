With great joy and illusion I share that I have started a new professional challenge. The vocation remains the same: strengthen the Ibero -American region. Now from the cities, in union of Ibero -American Capital Cities (UCCI).
Many thanks to the Ibero -American Conference and the Ibero -American General Secretariat (Segib) for so many years of learning and growth. We continue!

Within the framework of the 44th edition of the International Fair of Tourism Fitur, the Union of Ibero -American Capital Cities (UCCI) and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) we will present the Ibero -American Tourism Strategy of the Future (EIT) in the main stage of the City Council of Madrid, member city of UCCI, which also exercises the co -presidency of the international body and is its headquarters since 1982.
The EIT has also had the collaboration of the tourism responsible for the cities of Andorra La Vella; Bogotá; Buenos Aires; Mexico City; Lime; Madrid; Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and seeks to offer a local tourism management model that can be perfectly scalable to other cities and regions.
See you in #fitur

The Assembly also agreed to enhance the bilingualism of the region and declare the 2024 year of the Portuguese UCCI language and promote work in new areas of Latin America, through strategic alliances with entrepreneurs, universities, businessmen and other civil society actors.
It was my first general assembly in this, my new professional house, UCCI. We make Madrid happy and satisfied with the illusion and commitment to implement each of the agreed points.
Thanks to the UCCI coordinators. Thanks to my team that has worked tirelessly so that the assembly is a success.
Let's go for more.

Union of Ibero -American Capital Cities (UCCI) and CEU Digital today started a course on sustainable, intelligent and sensitive cities with the commitment to respond to the challenges, challenges and opportunities that cities have as nodes closest to citizens.
More than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, and this number is expected to continue growing in the coming decades. Although growth is unequal according to the region, it will be constant (UN).
The main environmental and human impacts are concentrated in cities: it is estimated that urban areas generate approximately 60% of world GDP, at the same time as 70% of carbon emissions and 60% of the use of resources.
It was for me a great satisfaction today inaugurate this course together with highlight Guarantee S3 answers.

Within the framework of the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly #Eurolat that held its fifteenth meeting in Madrid this week, I participated, on behalf of Ibero-American General Secretariat (Segib) in the Food Security Working Group and Fight against Hunger. Together with representatives of FAO, Action against Hunger and the European Investment Bank (BEI), from Segib we share the strategic priorities of the critical food security route, agreed by the heads of state and government of the region in the XXVIII Ibero -American Summit of Santo Domingo.
Although the ALC region is the largest net food exporter in the world, producing more than double what it consumes, with possession of more than 30% of the world's fresh water and about 40% of renewable aquatic natural resources, the Food insecurity and hunger have retreated at levels of the year 2000.
In this context, each of the organizations presented its vision. We all agree that it is from work in #Aliazas that we can overcome this great challenge on both sides of the Atlantic.
The Ibero -American Conference proposes a series of urgent actions to be developed (a total of 25) grouped into 4 large categories (below).
There is a long way to go. Parliaments, together with governments, private sector and multilat organismsErales have a shared responsibility before them. No country may in isolation outdoor food insecurity.
It has been an enriching experience. Thanks to the European Parliament Office in Spain, the Senate of Spain Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation - AECID, #Parlatino #Parlacen #Parlasur #Parlandino for the invitation
