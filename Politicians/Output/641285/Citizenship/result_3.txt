One more year, the general director of the #UCCI, Ana Román, delivered the Rosas of the Retirement Park to the Iberia crew to be transferred from the Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barojas airport to Mexico City.

This tradition, which already has 69 years of history, serves as a bond of union and brotherhood between both cities. Once in Mexico, the roses were collected by the president of the Ibero -American Fraternity A.C. (FIA), Fabián Maguey Ramírez and Queen Fia de Charros del Pedregal, Brianda Pereznegron, to later transfer them to the Basilica of Santa María de Guadalupe as offering to the Virgin.
