María Isabel Franco Sánchez (born 1970) is a Spanish journalist and politician, previously of Citizens (Cs), who was that party's candidate for President of the Region of Murcia ahead of the 2019 Murcian regional election as well as Vice President of the Region of Murcia and Regional Minister of Women, Equality, LGTBI, Families and Social Policy since August 2019.[1][2][3]
