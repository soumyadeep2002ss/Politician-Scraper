Dear President,
We  are  contacting  you  to  denounce  the  worrisome  situation  in  Spain  related  to  the
proposed reform of sedition and embezzlement offences deemed to be adopted at the
proposal of the government and its and their pro-independence partners.
You will find attached to this letter a manifesto from the Association for the Defence of
the  Values of  the  Transition,  after  having  examined the  proposal  for  an  Organic  Law,
which reduces the embezzlement of public funds and abolishes the crime of sedition as
defined in the 1995 Criminal Code.
Citizens Pro Europe adheres fully to the mentioned manifesto and recalls that:
•The EU is a community of law where the rule of law is the foundation of its stability
and democratic functioning.
•The  Constitutional  order  of  any  Member  State  of  the  European  Union  is  an
indivisible  part  of  the  EU  legal  order  and  must  be  safeguarded  and  defended
against those that try to break it.
•Abolishing  the  crime  of  sedition  runs  contrary  to  the  Spanish  constitution  and
represents a direct threat to the legal order of Spain and the European Union.

•Reducing the penalties for embezzlement by politicians puts at risk the financial
interest  of  Spain  and  of  the  European  Union,  especially  in  a  country  highly
dependent on EU funding.
Multiple  instances  have  strongly  criticized  these  proposals,  which  lack  the  necessary
consensus and, if adopted, would not only put in danger the Constitutional order in Spain
but also the financial interest of the European Union. We would like to recall that Spain
is due to receive €140 billion from the NGEU alone.
There  should  be  no  room  in  the  EU  to  legislatead  hominento  protect  the  political
interests  of  a  few,  preserving  their  narrow  political  majority  in  the  Parliament,  and to
providethe  factoimpunity  for  politicians.  It  would  be  unthinkable  for the  European
institutions  to,  in  the  wake  of  the  recent  Qatar  scandal,  propose  the  lowering  of  the
threshold  of  responsibility  for  those  involved.  The  proposals  mentioned  above  would
have precisely the effect of lowering such standards. Europe must stand firm in the wake
of  such  undemocratic  practises,  as  it  has  done  in  the  past  with  Poland  and  Hungary.
Democracy in our continent must not be an instrument to safeguard the interests of a
powerful few, be they elected or not.

We hope and trust that the European institutions will address, as a matter of urgency,
this very worrisome legal proposals with the Spanish government.
Yours sincerely,
Prof. Dr Teresa Freixes
