Changes in the Municipal Group of the Popular Party. This Thursday in the Plenary Session has accepted the resignation of Antonio Saldaña as a councilor, resigns that he has been elected Andalusian parliamentarian. In addition to councilor, Saldaña was the spokesman of the popular in the City of Jerez, and now that position is already held by Jaime Espinar. The spokesman of the popular group is now Almudena Martínez del Junco and, therefore, she and Espinar are the two councilors with exclusive dedication.

To occupy the position that leaves Saldaña, the PP have had to go to the 13th place in the list with which they attended the last municipal elections, the position occupied by Yesssika Quintero Palma, which will be a new popular councilor. Quintero is the president of the Venezuelan Association of Jerez and so far exercised as an insurance agent.

But, in the electoral list in the positions prior to that of Yesssika were Nausika Botamino, municipal worker, and Álvaro Real, general director of water infrastructure of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development of the Junta de Andalucía. The two, Botamino and Real, have renounced to be councilors.

Precisely, if there were another new vacancy in the popular ranks, which held the following position on the electoral list of the 2019 elections was María José García Pelayo, already designated by her party as a candidate for mayor of Jerez.
