Growth and Emerging Markets Committee

The Growth and Emerging Markets Committee is the largest Committee within IOSCO, representing over 75% of the IOSCO's ordinary membership. The Committee seeks to promote the development and greater efficiency of emerging securities and futures markets by establishing principles and minimum standards, providing training programs and technical assistance for members and facilitating the exchange of information and transfer of technology and expertise.

The GEM comprises 90 members and 24 non-voting associate members who include the world's fastest growing economies and 10 of the G-20 members. Emerging economies are expected to represent a growing portion of IOSCO membership as new members continue to join.

IOSCO is the only international standard setter that has a Committee solely responsible for emerging market issues. This inclusiveness increases IOSCO's effectiveness and positions it to play a bigger part in shaping the global regulatory framework: The GEM has been allocated a seat on the IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board.
