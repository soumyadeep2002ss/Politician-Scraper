IOSCO signs new headquarters agreement with the Government of Spain 
 
The   International   Organization   of   Securities   Commissions   (IOSCO) has   today   signed   a   new 
Headquarters Agreement with the Kingdom of Spain.  This agreement will provide IOSCO with many 
of  the privileges commonly accorded  to  international  organisations,  providing  it  with  a sounder  basis 
upon which to operate as the headquarters for its global membership. 
 
Greg Tanzer, Secretary General of IOSCO, said: 
 
“On  behalf  of  IOSCO, I  would  like  to  thank the Spanish  State for the  support it  has 
shown us since our arrival in Madrid in 2000.  I believe that today’s new agreement will 
provide IOSCO with a sound basis from which to continue its contribution to the efforts 
of the global economic community in addressing the current financial crisis. 
 
“I  would  also  like  to  extend  my  appreciation  and  gratitude  to  our  colleagues  at  the 
Comisión  Nacional  del  Mercado  de Valores  (CNMV), particularly  Fernando  Restoy, 
who have  been  kind  and  helpful  hosts  over  the  last  eleven  years  and  have  been 
instrumental in assisting us in concluding this agreement.” 
 
IOSCO is the leading international policy forum for securities regulators and is recognised as the global 
standard setter for securities regulation.  The organization's membership regulates more than 95% of the 
world's  securities  markets  in  115  jurisdictions  and  its  membership  continues  to  expand.  It  has  been 
headquartered in Madrid since 2000.
