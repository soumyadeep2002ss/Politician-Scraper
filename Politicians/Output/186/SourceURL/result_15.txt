20but somewhere he failed to perform his duty as far as convincing the INDIA bloc leaders to propose the name of Nitish Kumar as convener or the coordinator. Nitish ji is a sharp politician and he had got this sense that continuing Lalan babu in the top post might cost him when the time of seat-sharing comes. Nitish ji is a hard bargainer and he wanted to take everything in his control before the talks could begin. A message was already given to Lalan babu to tender his resignation, he just followed the instruction of Nitish ji,” a senior JD(U) leader who was present in the meeting told The Hindu on the condition of anonymity.

The JD(U) leader however denied that Mr. Singh was shown the door because of his proximity with Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, as claimed by BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi.  

‘Lalan is RJD agent’

Mr. Modi, however, reiterated that his prediction has been fulfilled, alleging that Mr. Singh was engaged in breaking the JD(U) at the behest of Mr. Yadav.

“Removing him from the post of national president has come true within a week but this is the beginning of the game, not the end. The split of the party is certain. Those who were calling the news of Lalan Singh’s resignation as a ‘game of media and BJP’ will now have to hide their faces for a few days. After the removal of Lalan Singh, the workers celebrated it by distributing sweets and bursting crackers in the JD(U) office as if they had got freedom from a wrong person,“ Mr. Modi said.

He further claimed that two groups have formed within the JD(U), one led by Mr. Singh which includes 12 MLAs and supports the RJD chief, and another group which maintains goodwill towards the BJP. Mr. Modi also opined that if Mr. Singh had not been removed in time, he would have merged the JD(U) into RJD while working as Mr. Yadav’s agent.

Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav termed Mr. Modi’s claims as “imaginary”, and congratulated Mr. Kumar over his new role. He also denied reports of cancelling a trip to Australia, scheduled for January 6, due to the changed political scenario. “It’s nothing as such, foreign trips are part of the government and last time I went to Japan also. I keep getting the invitation and recently I got the invitation from London and Berlin as well. Many times, government officials visit there,” he said.
