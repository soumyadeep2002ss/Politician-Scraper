A first information report has been lodged against Janata Dal  United leader and Member of Bihar's Legislative Assembly Anant Singh in connection with the murder of  contractor Sanjay Singh.

Sanjay was shot dead in broad daylight, at Boring Road in central Patna, on Tuesday. Police sources said that Sanjay, who is related to Anant Singh, also had a criminal background.

"MLA Anant Singh, along with his shooter Bhola Singh and three others, were named as accused in the killing of Sanjay Singh," said a police official.

Sanjay Singh's nephew Raja Parikhshit, the main witness in the case, lodged an FIR naming Anant Singh as the conspirator.

Anant Singh, a JD-U MLA from Mokama and a close aide of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, has 21 criminal cases lodged against him. And he reportedly continues his illegal activities even now.

Sanjay's elder brother Arvind Singh also accused Anant Singh of ordering the killing.

About two months ago, Anant Singh had hit the headlines after brutally assaulting a journalist and a photographer, who had gone to his Patna residence to seek his comments about reports linking him to the rape and murder of a local woman. Anant Singh was arrested after the incident but he was later released on bail.



In 2004, Anant Singh was seen brandishing an AK-47 in public, but no action was taken against him despite the fact that only security personnel are allowed to carry the assault rifle.
