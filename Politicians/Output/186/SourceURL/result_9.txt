Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar's mother Parmeshwari Devi died today after protracted illness at his official residence here, officials at the chief minister's house said.

As Kumar was exchanging New Year greetings with people, officials posted at the CM's house informed him that his mother was serious and suffering from breathlessness.

An ambulance with a team of doctors was called to attend to her, but she fell unconscious and breathed her last with Kumar and other family members being at her bed side.

She was 92.

She was shifted to one Anne Marg, the chief minister's residence, a fortnight ago from the Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology after improvement in her condition and since then she had been there where doctors kept attending on her on daily basis.

As the news of her death spread, deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi and several other ministers, including Vijay Choudhary, Vijendra Yadav and NK Yadav, visited the CM's house to offer condolences.
