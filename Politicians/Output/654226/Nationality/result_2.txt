Report on the Administration of Justice
in the year 2022
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We were taught to respect the magistrates, and it was there
also taught to respect the laws and not to forget
Never we have to protect those who receive offense.
And we were also taught to respect those laws not
writings that reside in the universal feeling of what it is
just and of what is common sense.
Here in Athens we do this.

INTRODUCTION
 
First of all, I address my deferent greeting to the President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella
expressing particular satisfaction for the renewal of his assignment which will also allow the
Judiciary to continue having a safe driving and a precious guarantee of respect for his
constitutional prerogatives.
I also greet:
the representative of the Superior Council of the judiciary;
Dr. Giusi Bartolozzi, deputy chief of Cabinet Vicar, representative of the Minister of
Justice;
all civil and military authorities;
The magistrates of the District and the colleagues of the other judiciary;
the district lawyer and the lawyers of the State, the presidents of the councils of the Order of
District and lawyers, with whom we share the difficult exercise of jurisdiction;
the magnificent rector of the University of Palermo and the illustrious exponents of the academic world;
honorary magistrates;
the police forces, an efficiency model and to whom I renew once again, in this
Solemn opportunity, my gratitude for the commitment that depicts daily in all
institutional tasks. A commitment that just a few days ago was crowned by the capture of
Matteo Messina Denaro to whom a patient, long and unrelated work of
investigation managed with a choral action under the coordination of the Public Prosecutor's Office
of Palermo and completed in the absolute compliance with the rules of a state of law from
Carabinieri to whom I address a particular praise;
The administrative staff who contributes to the functioning of the
Justice;
Journalists whose correct information activities constitutes an indispensable garrison of
democracy;
The teachers and students who are physically present this year again and are certain
who will make their contribution to the debate again.
Finally, I thank Radio Radicale for the precious work he continues to do.
 
************************
 
Also in the period in question the functioning of the administration of justice in this
judicial district presented a diversified trend between the two sectors of jurisdiction.
In the civil sector there is a turnaround compared to the previous year: in fact,
After a year characterized by a significant increase in both the surviving [6.2%] and the
Definitions [16.6%] with consequent reduction of the final slope [-6.5%], in the A.G. 2021-22 yes
observe a flexion genhad not only of the surviving [-6.4%] but also of the
definitions [-6.5%], which produced a decline in the number of pending procedures equal to
6.2%.
