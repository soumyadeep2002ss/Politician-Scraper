The case of the personal prelature of the Genoese
In late Baroque Rome
Abstract: This Essay Publishes The Preliminary Findings of a Study of the Personal Prela
Tures Established in Rome Bethaeen the Seventenenth and Eighteenth Century by Some
Cardinals Belonging to the Genoese Aristocracy. Of Particle Importance in This Context
Are the Pallavicino and Spinola Prelatures, Respectively founded by Cardinals Lazzaro
Pallavicino (in 1679) and Gio. Battista spinola ‚the young man '(in 1707). These ecclesiasti
Cal positions Were Established by Means of a Bequest Assigning a Significant Annual
income (Alongside the use of a prestigious residence, Fully Furnished and endowed with
A Library, in The Case of the Spinola Prelature) to the Kinsman Who in Each Generation
Showed Most Promise Ameng Those Who Had Entered The Clergy. Above All, Lazzaro and
Gio. Battista Desired The Beneficiaries of the Bequest to take up permanent residence
At the Papal Court, Thereby Establishing a Firm Connection Bethaeen the Family and the
Curia. Personal Prelatures Thus Sagar to Be a Further Part of the Larger Social, Politi
Cal, and Cultural Picture of the Nationes in Rome. The Spinola Prelature, in Particular,
Responded to the More Specific Aim of Establishing in Cardinal's Court As a Site of Diplo
Macy, with spaces suitable for socializing and political negotiation.
The intent of these pages is to make known the first results of a research that specifically
concern the personal prelatures established in Rome, between the end of the seventeenth century and the beginning of the
Next century, by some purple belonging to the nobility, old 'Genoese -
Spinola, Pallavicino - or exponents of families, new 'who now boasted
bonds of equivalent weight and intensity with the court and the Curia: Costaguta, Giusti
niani.
Many questions that still surround the birth of these institutions: a
phenomenon completely unexplored and rich in interest, in the framework of political relations
plomatic, social and economic between the Republic of Genoa and the papacy, scope of
research which in turn is scarcely frequented.

Cati at the Barberinian age) I remember that of Diego Pizzorno, the most full -bodied, Genoa and Rome between five

This case of study on the other hand appears to be well predisposed to Dialogre
with a further address, which proved to be very prolific and capable of guaranteeing
precious advancements. I am referring to the rich masses of work on the papal court
2
  It is on
Social, cultural and political mosaic consisting of the Nationes of Rome.

  We know that
Starting from the second four hundred and at least until the mid -seventeenth century the papacy
he pursued "a unitary project", aimed at "organizing foreign presence ...
Through colleges, hospitals, national churches "; program "which had a
declared a religious sign, but evident in the economic and cultural level ";
In short, an idea of a "polycentric city", consisting of a dense "network of embassies
And of cardinal courts ".
4
Albeit with a few decades of delay, the personal prelatures in fact became
A further piece of this same mosaic. On the other hand the appearance of these
Institutions in late Barocca Rome would seem first of all to respond to the specifications
necessity of the republic and its patriciate.

The tuning point of 1644: the party of the Republic '
and the signs of Genoa on the palaces of the cardinals
Andrea Spinola (1562? –1631), the most important Genoese political thinker of the age
modern, he wrote that the Cardinals, 'not served the republic, indeed the
They disappear ... it is madness to believe that we can expect good served by our cardinals ";

His other pages benefit to clarify the assumption: "Sometimes it gives up a lot to our repu
Blici who neglected them publicals are treated in Rome with the medium of our prelates and cardi
nali. Mostly solely to be immersed in the interests of the Court and many, for the drawing
De ’lor growth, there is no love of homeland that holds".
6
  In other words, Spinola, who
Ben met Rome and his court, remained faithful to the republican tradition,
convinced that it would be better to "use any citizen of our citizens,
That it was, as we say, of a short hood and subject to our secular hole ".
7
   There
Praxis was precisely quite another, that is, it is "very well known that the cardinals of the nation 'occupy
they often see political interests ..., doing from intermediaries to the pontiff e
the Curia ",
8
  And that "Some even assumed the aspect of agent of his government".

In 1644, with the death of Urban VIII - with the sunset of the Barberinian age, he was
