the neighbouring Christian kingdom of Asturias. Under Sancho I Garcés (905–925), the rulers of Pamplona expanded their dominions south of the Ebro River, capturing Nájera and much of La Rioja. Under Sancho III Garcés (1000–35), the Navarrese established a brief hegemony over all of Christian Spain. Sancho’s empire proved short-lived, however, for at his death the kingdom was divided up into Navarra, Aragon, and Castile. In 1076 Sancho Ramírez of Aragon occupied Pamplona. Navarra was then ruled by the Aragonese crown until 1134, when it recovered its independence under Garcia IV, who reigned until 1150. A succession of French dynasties ruled Navarra after 1234.

Though Navarra at an early date ceased to have a frontier with the Muslims, many Muslims continued to live there. They were allowed to serve in the army and also provided an important source of skilled artisans. Large Jewish congregations, aljamas, existed in the chief towns and were protected by the Navarrese kings when persecution became serious elsewhere. Despite its small size in the later Middle Ages, Navarra played an important part in international politics, partly because it controlled the main pass into Spain in the western Pyrenees and was a buffer state between Gascony, Castile, and Aragon. The chief pilgrim roads from the north to Santiago de Compostela also traversed the kingdom.

In 1512 Ferdinand II of Aragon occupied the Spanish portion of Navarra, which was formally annexed to the Castilian crown in 1515. The Spanish portion was governed by a viceroy and retained many of its own laws and institutions until 1833, when it was fully incorporated into Spain. The French portion of Navarra, consisting of the northern slope of the western Pyrenees, remained a separate kingdom until 1589, when it was united with France.

Vicente Rodriguez

Spanish Navarra continued to retain some of its historical foral (regional) rights, mainly in the areas of taxation and administration, until the end of the Francisco Franco regime in 1975. Upon Spain’s subsequent transition to democracy, Navarra’s historical status as a foral community was recognized within the framework of Spain’s 1978 constitution and Navarra’s statute of autonomy of August 10, 1982.
