Introduction

Insopressible human instinct, practiced aimed at knowledge, aimed at some eras to
military or religious conquest, in any case basic for trade, but also experience
aimed at achieving physical or spiritual salvation, the journey, in its varied facets, the
City and territories, goals of the journey in history, are the main object of investigation of the essays
presented in this volume.
Starting from'Theme articulation of the VIII AISU Congress held in Naples in the
September 2017, the following contributions, offered by scholars from all over the world,
they highlight a multiplicity of meanings and retrace a wide range of traces,
assuming different views and using different approaches, headed by the many areas
disciplines that invest urban history.
Therefore, numerous essays collected here are dedicated to the relationship between travel and
knowledge, in its values and purposes, sometimes detecting the individual character, Talaltra
the collective one, highlighting the ways and forms of the gaze with which in time the
places, focusing on the related descriptive sources.
Another section of this collector's work proposes an overall reflection on the themes of
modern tourism as a practice that absorbs those of leisure among its main reasons
and Loisir, as a cultural category extended to a large audience of subjects, as a phenomenon
social and global social from which significant transformations of the urban territory descend
and extra -urban. The consequent adjustment, modernization,
enhancement of infrastructures, and in general the transformations, aspects examined in one

Some writings, then, focused on the theme of the historic city, which as a scenario of the
artistic, literary and consumer goods related to travel, has become attractive
of the new cultural and tourist industry, as a place stretched outwards and open
the reception, characterized by its creative abilities and by an intrinsic vocation towards
innovation. In this context, the influence of the narrative, of the literature of
travel, guides, figurative and visual arts, information and communication,
of new technologies, together with the role played by fashions and trends, by religious factors,
as well as by public policies.
Another section of the volume faces the city as a background of great events, and as such
object of chronicles and literary descriptions, multiple narratives that since the end of the nineteenth century
They also made use of new media for representation.
Numerous studies, again, analyze the theme of the relationship between the different religions which, in times
different, have configured opportunities for varying travel, moved by devotion and by
proselytism, from wishes of conquest or by care vocations, thus reconstructing a
significant chapter of history of culture, as well as architecture.
Finally, the attention to the gaze of the other is also important, identifiable over time with the
merchant, the military, the politician, the diplomat, the migrant or the refugee: experiences that
