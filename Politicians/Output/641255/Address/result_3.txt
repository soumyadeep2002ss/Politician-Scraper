Valladolid International Film Festival (Seminci) is not officially inaugurated until the mayor of the city and the councilwoman in charge of the festival are accredited. So, as tradition dictates, on the first Friday of the festival, Jesús Julio Carnero and Blanca Jiménez Cuadrillero officially became the week’s opening ceremonies as mayor and councilor for Tourism, Events and City Branding, respectively.

They were accompanied by José Luis Cienfuegos, who is also premiering his first Seminci from the inside, in his case as director, and by Unicaja Duero, a veteran entity in its support of the festival, represented by Manuel Rubio, regional director, and María José Rivera, Institutional Relations director of the entity. The official picture was completed by Mila Aguado, manager of Fecosva (Valladolid commerce association), and Jesús Herreras, its president.

Mayor and festival director also invited all the members of the festival team to be photographed with them before enjoying the cake made by the city bakers.

The 68th Seminci is expected to be a busy one and, above all, it is committed to the participation of the public. In addition to the hundreds of screenings programmed, there will be an endless number of activities designed so that Seminci members can interact with the protagonists. In this case, there are 107 meetings between round tables, talks, presentations, and dialogues.
