The League of Arab States (LAS) shares a common mission with the United Nations (UN):  promoting peace, security and stability by preventing conflict, resolving disputes and acting in a spirit of solidarity and unity. In doing so, the two organizations also work together to expand economic opportunity, advance respect for human rights and build political inclusion. 

The UN and the LAS signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 1989, which was renewed in 2016 by concluding a Protocol of Amendment. In June 2019, the UN opened a Liaison Office to the League of Arab States in Cairo, the first such office to be funded through the regular budget. The UN and LAS secretariats and respective agencies, funds and programmes regularly hold general cooperation and sectoral meetings. as mandated by the General Assembly. The two organizations also continue to invest in building their engagement through capacity-building exercises and staff exchanges. The Security Council also has sought to strengthen interaction with the LAS, including by holding informal informal meetings between its members and the LAS.
