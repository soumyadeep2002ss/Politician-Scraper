European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said after a foreign affairs council Monday that the council had greenlit a new mission proposed by Italy, France and Germany to protect Red Sea shipping from attacks by Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.
    "We have agreed, in principle, to start the EU mission in the Red Sea," he said.
    "Now we have to work on unanimity as to when (it will start)," he added.
