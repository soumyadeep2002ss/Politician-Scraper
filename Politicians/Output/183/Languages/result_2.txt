Sushila Devi wins silver at Commonwealth Games 2022.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS
Sushila Devi Likmabam clinched the silver medal in Women's Judo 48 kg categor at the Commonwealth Games 2022.
This was her second CWG silver medal.
She was defeated in the final by by Michaela Whitebooi of South Africa.
Judoka Sushila Devi Likmabam clinched India's seventh medal, and the first outside weightlifting at the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham. She won the silver medal in the women's 48 kg category at the Games. In the final, she was defeated by Michaela Whitebooi of South Africa.
The final proved to be an end to end encounter with both judokas not leaving an inch till the final whistle as both of them failed to register a single point at the end of regulation time. The contest then went into a golden score period, where the South African Judoka clinched the gold medal after winning a point by putting Sushila Devi's shoulders to the mat.
Sushila Devi had quite a smooth ride in her run-up to the final clash against the South African. In the quarter final she registered a 10-0 win over Malawian judoka Harriet Boniface. In the semi-final she again crushed her opponent 10-0, defeating Mauritian Judoka Priscilla Morand.
This is her second silver medal at the Commonwealth Games. In the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, then 19-year-old Sushila Devi won the silver medal in the same category. This makes her the most successful Indian judoka in the event's history, and the first Indian to win two medals at the quadrennial event. She also became the third silver medallist for India at the Commonwealth Games 2022, after weightlifters Sanket Sargar and Bindyarani Devi.
In fact, Sushila Devi became the first Indian to qualify in judo at the Olympics, when she did so at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Shortly after Sushila Devi's win, Vijay Kumar Yadav won the second medal for India at the event in the sport. He defeated Cyprus' Petros Christodoulides to clinch the bronze medal in the men's 60 kg category. India now have won eight medals at the Commonwealth Games, and ensured a further medal in Lawn Bowls Women's four category.
