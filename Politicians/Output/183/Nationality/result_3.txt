2C etched her name in the history of the Indian sport. An elusive gold medal slipped out of her hand but Shushila has done what no other Indian judoka has done in the past.

The Birmingham medal is a reward for not giving up. Shushila will certainly be hungrier for more after the historic showing at the Commonwealth Games.
