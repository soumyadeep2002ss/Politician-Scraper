55 years
University professor
Feminist and public school activist

«The VTLP project has been a breath of fresh air. Another way of doing politics that opens doors and windows on a controllable scale, to build social majorities that work for a more just, human, sustainable, feminist and equitable city. »

Biography

I was born in the middle of the olive grove, in Torredonjimeno (Jaén), where I spent my childhood and adolescence, studying in public centers, up to 18 years. I marched to study pedagogy at the University of Granada and there I spent my university years beginning to participate in unit student organizations (measures, democratic leftist movement of students) and in the communist youth of Andalusia in the trepidant 80s.

I started studying my doctorate between scholarships and precarious jobs until in 1994 I arrived in Valladolid where I still live and I have been able to develop my personal and professional life. For more than 25 years I am a professor at the Faculty of Education and Social Work, doing what I like, teaching and learning with my students.

Participation in organizations

Milito in IU since its foundation and I am coordinator of the Local Assembly of Valladolid for 7 years. As a teacher, I participate in pedagogical renewal movements and on the platforms in defense of public education.

As a woman, I have participated in several periods in the Women's Coordinator of Valladolid and in different feminist associations. As a worker, I am affiliated with the CCOO and Union Delegate Teaching Union. I also have a usual relationship with the organizations of the Third Sector of the city, with which I work with my students, future teachers, teachers and social educators.

Motivational guideline

From the beginning, the Valladolid project takes the floor has been a fresh air for me. Another way of doing politics that opens doors and windows on a controllable scale, that of the city, to build social majorities that work for a more just, human, sustainable, feminist and equitable city. There is nothing !!

I have participated in the project since its inception and now it's time to step forward. I think it is necessary to close the shoulder, provide knowledge and experiences and continue advancing in an exciting and solid project, which has shown with facts that a city can be governed from other parameters, with other policies and that makes every day we live a little better (Although I am not sure that we can fix from the City Council the cold, the only defect of this beautiful city)
