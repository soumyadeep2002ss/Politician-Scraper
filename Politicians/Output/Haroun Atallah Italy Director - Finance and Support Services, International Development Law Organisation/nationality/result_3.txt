IDLO AND THE UN

By combining research and thought leadership on the rule of law with expertise in implementing it, IDLO cuts a distinct profile in the development sector. Our topical interventions are multiplying in international fora – above all at the United Nations, where we are emerging as a privileged interlocutor. We have observer status and liaison offices in New York and Geneva. Every year, IDLO addresses the General Assembly. We work closely with the Italian mission, and undertake joint projects with the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UNICEF and UNAIDS.

In both New York and Geneva, we participate in high-level meetings and co-host rule-of-law themed events. Our research and conclusions are showcased at the Human Rights Council, and we facilitate debates and encounters that further the world's understanding of law and development. While not part of the UN, we are aligned with its goals, synchronized with its processes, and increasingly listened to.
