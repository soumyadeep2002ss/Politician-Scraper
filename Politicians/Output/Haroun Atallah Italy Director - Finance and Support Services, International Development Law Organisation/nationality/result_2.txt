Board of Trustees

The Board of Trustees is Islamic Relief’s highest governing body, responsible for overseeing operations globally and setting strategy. The Board is made up of seven members who each bring a diverse set of skills and experience to the Board, while also representing partner offices in Australia, Canada, Malaysia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.

 About us > Board of Trustees
Our Values And Faith Perspective

Our new governance structure means that the first seven people elected to the Board of Trustees represent partner offices in seven countries: Australia, Canada, Malaysia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. Over the course of 2021 there is scope for the Board to double in size as more partners elect representatives to the IGA, the IGA in turn elects more Board members, and a number of independent trustees are selected from outside Islamic Relief by the global family.

A term for an Islamic Relief Worldwide trustee is four years, and each trustee is limited to two terms. Elections will take place at the end of each four-year term and additionally if a place on the Board becomes vacant in the middle of a term.
