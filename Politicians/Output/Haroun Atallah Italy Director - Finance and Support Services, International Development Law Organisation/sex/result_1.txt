Do you possess substantial experience in senior management responsibility including the development of strategies? Proven track record of raising funds and marketing as well as knowledge and understanding of Islamic principles of Waqf and endowment management laws and broader Charity standards (in England & Wales)? If so, we would be delighted to hear from you!
 
The International Waqf Fund (IWF) aims to provide a sustainable source of funding for Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW) through promoting Waqf, managing the IRW endowment funds and allocating the returns to development projects in accordance with the wishes of the donors.

IWF also collaborates with the IRW members to promote Waqf and sustainable income for IRW projects. IWF will grow the Waqf fund and manage Waqf assets to ensure that endowment funds are safely invested, and returns used for supporting humanitarian and development projects for those in need.

IWF delivers on its stated objectives in support of the IRW vision and in compliance with Islamic jurisprudence (sharia) regarding Waqf.
