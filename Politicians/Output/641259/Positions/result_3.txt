History [edit]
Main article: Valladolid Council

When Count Ansúrez arrived as lord and governor of the town there were already two parishes, an insignificant defensive enclosure and a fence. There was also a reconcilium or council as a citizen organization, a meeting of the people represented by the most notable. The two parishes were that of San Miguel and that of San Julián, both with their respective hamlet forming parishes or collations. The fence must have been of little height, rather an palisade. The concilium that Count Ansúrez has already established and to the one that is directed in the endowational letter and in other documents, was the germ of what was later called council , Council and finally community.1

When, in 1072, Alfonso VI entrusted Count Pedro Ansúrez and his wife Doña Eylo Alfonso the repopulation of Valladolid, the demographic increase and the appearance of an incipient commercial sector predisposed to the appearance of the council of Valladolid, 2 as a form of local government , to whose front was the Dominus. The first document quoted by this council dates from 1095.3 gradually, the attributions of the council were increasing until in the middle of the 12th century, at the head of the town was a judge appointed by the king, which granted judicial independence to the institution .

The first meetings of the Council were held in foreign premises or in the cloister of the Collegiate Church of Santa María, until 1338, when their own houses were built in the old Plaza de Santa María (today University of the University). Simultaneously, there was another town hall, located in the Plaza Mayor, on land assigned by the missing convent of San Francisco, located on the southern sidewalk of the square.

The Town Hall, in the Plaza Mayor of Valladolid, is the headquarters of the City Council since 1908.

In the thirteenth century, in charge of the Costcile Vallisoleti, four mayors and a Meri Merino were found; He was subject to an important real intervention and composed of notaries, jurors, commissioned by the seal, montaneros, defeseros etc.4 In the middle of the century, Alfonso X the Wise, established an exclusivity regime to access municipal positions.
