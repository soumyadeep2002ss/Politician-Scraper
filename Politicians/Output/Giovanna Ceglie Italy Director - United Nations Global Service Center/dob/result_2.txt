Our Leadership

The United Nations Global Service Centre (UNGSC) is an integral part of the United Nations Department of Operational Support (DOS) Office of Supply Chain Management (OSCM), and a close partner of the Office of Information and Communications Technology (OICT).  

To guarantee robust and uninterrupted communications and advanced technology services globally, UNGSC operates from two bases, one in Brindisi, Italy, and one in Valencia, Spain (the United Nations Information and Communications Technology Facility, UNICTF).  

UNGSC is comprised of three pillars: Supply Chain Service (SCS); Service for Geospatial Information and Telecommunications Technology (SGITT); and Central Service (CS).
