Antonio Mollari, un problema di comunicazione / Antonio Mollari, a communication problem

Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)

Gianfranco Berchiesi

2015-01-01

Full Text Available La riscoperta della figura di Antonio Mollari, in seguito al ritrovamento presso il Comune di Petriolo di cinque sue tavole acquerellate, ebbe inizio con la mostra del 2006, nella quale lâ€™esposizione di alcune delle piÃ¹ interessanti tavole conservate a Trieste, Foligno e Macerata e una conferenza del Prof. Cruciani Fabozzi, seguita dalla storia della famiglia Mollari ad opera dellâ€™Ing. CarratÃ¹, delinearono un primo â€œritrattoâ€ della personalitÃ  di Antonio Mollari. Da quella data Ã¨ poi maturata lâ€™idea di indagare in maniera piÃ¹ adeguata la sua attivitÃ , giungendo al Convegno tenuto allâ€™Abbadia di Fiastra nel 2013. Lâ€™autore mette in evidenza come la figura di Antonio Mollari, al di lÃ  del giudizio tecnico che possono esprimere i relatori che si sono succeduti nel Convegno, ha un problema legato alla comunicazione. Chi era Mollari e come potrebbe essere adeguatamente presentato in una riunione di persone non addette ai lavori? Era architetto, ingegnere, tecnico? Oppure, alla bisogna, era lâ€™una o lâ€™altra di queste figure? In this report it is narrated that in 2006 the figure of Antonio Mollari was reproposed, after the discovery of five watercolormaps at the municipality of Petriolo, by means of a small exhibition to which Prof. Cruciani Fabozzi gave the right approach. From that date an interest in the idea of a more appropriate and extensive discussion on Antonio Mollari is later gained, reaching the Conference held in the Abbey of Fiastra in 2013. The author highlights how the figure of Antonio Mollari has a problem with the communication, beyond the technical opinion, expressed by the speakers that have taken place in the conference. Who was Mollari and how could he be adequately presented at a meeting of persons not qualified in this matter? It was Architect or Engineer? Or, as needed, was the one or the other of these figures?

Implementation of an Online Climate Science Course at San Antonio College

Reyes, R.; Strybos, J.

2016-12-01

San Antonio College (SAC) plans to incorporate an online climate science class into the curriculum with a focus on local weather conditions and data. SAC is part of a network of five community colleges based around San Antonio, Texas, has over 20,000 students enrolled, and its student population reflects the diversity in ethnicity, age and gender of the San Antonio community. The college understands the importance of educating San Antonio residents on climate science and its complexities. San Antonio residents are familiar with weather changes and extreme conditions. The region has experienced an extreme drought, including water rationing in the city. Then, this year's El NiÃ±o intensified expected annual rainfalls and flash floods. The proposed climate science course will uniquely prepare students to understand weather data and the evidence of climate change impacting San Antonio at a local level. This paper will discuss the importance and challenges of introducing the new climate science course into the curriculum, and the desired class format that will increase the course's success. Two of the most significant challenges are informing students about the value of this class and identifying the best teaching format. Additionally, measuring and monitoring enrollment will be essential to determine the course performance and success. At the same time, Alamo Colleges is modifying the process of teaching online classes and is officially working to establish an online college. Around 23% of students enrolled in SAC offered courses are currently enrolled in online courses only, representing an opportunity to incorporate the climate science class as an online course. Since the proposed course will be using electronic textbooks and online applications to access hyperlocal weather data, the class is uniquely suited for online students.

Feasibility study on rehabilitation of ICE San Antonio Power Plant

Energy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)

2001-03-01

Costa Rica takes a power generation system using hydro power generation as the main source, and possesses medium-capacity gas turbines to supplement needs in the dry season and the peak load. However, a problem has come up that, in addition to the cost rise in gas turbine fuel, the power generation efficiency has been aggravating due toaged deterioration of the generators being used. In association therewith, the problem is now a factor to increase CO2 emission, which is a worldwide problem. Keeping in mind to link it to the clean development mechanism (CDM), the present project is, taking up the SAN ANTONIO power plant as the investigation object, intended to perform a comprehensive discussion on the CO2 emission reducing effect, profitability, and proliferation effect, by executing the conceptual plant design. The up-grading plan for thermal power generation systems in Costa Rica consists of replacement of the gas turbines, handling of phase modifiers, and achievement of the combined cycle. The plan agrees with the present feasibility study intended of CO2 emission reduction, consisting of the modification plan of the SAN ANTONIO power plant, that is the plan to replace the over-aged gas turbines at the power plant. Its necessity has been identified. It was disclosed that the project has the effects of reducing CO2 of 82,000 tons annually, and the investment can be recovered in nine years. (NEDO)

Antonio Mollari fra Canova e Valadier / Antonio Mollari between Canova and Valadier

Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)

Elisa Debenedetti

2014-04-01

Full Text Available Non Ã¨ difficile inserire Antonio Mollari in un contesto europeo. Ad Antonio Canova lo lega una prima, importantissima lettera del 4 maggio 1807 nella quale, in seguito ad un invito trasmessogli dallo scultore, ma di cui Ã¨ responsabile Filippo III Colonna, enumera tutte le sue opere; la seconda risale al 25 febbraio 1809. Dalla prima missiva si riescono a stabilire numerosi contatti con Giuseppe Valadier: a Corridonia (Collegiata dei Santi Pietro, Paolo e Donato; Ospedale e Chiesa di San Salvatore e a Macerata (Palazzo Conti giÃ  Ugolini. Tanto da giungere a considerare Mollari come il continuatore del Valadier nei cantieri marchigiani, dove la presenza del Maestro si manifesta come una sovrapposizione di motivi francesizzanti a soluzioni palladiane: componenti entrambe presenti nel Palazzo Tomassini a Corridonia, ricondotto al Maceratese. Fra lâ€™altro le pagine di due Taccuini valadieriani, certo a lui note, si possono considerare a metÃ  strada fra lâ€™esercizio tipologico ed il modello. Itâ€™s not difficult to insert Antonio Mollari into a European context. A first very important letter, dated May 4th 1807, links him to Antonio Canova whereby, after inviting him, by wish of Phillip Colonna III , he then makes a list of all his works of art; the second is dated February 25th 1809. Various contacts with Giuseppe Valadier can be established from the first letter: in Corridonia (Saints Peter, Paul and Donato Collegiate church; St. Saviourâ€™s Hospital and Church and in Macerata (Conti Palace ex Ugolini. So much so as to regard Mollari as Valadierâ€™s continuator in the Marche construction sites, where the Maestroâ€™s presence is expressed like a superimposition of Frenchified motives for Palladian solutions: both components being present in the Tomassini Palace in Corridonia, which can be traced back to Mollari. Moreover the pages of two Valdier Notebooks, which he must have known about, can be considered half way between a typological exercise

Palabras pronunciadas durante las honras fÃºnebres, Iglesia Inmaculada ConcepciÃ³n del ChicÃ³, Diciembre 21, 2010

Con el desgarramiento de las calamidades imprevistas y ahogados por la sorpresa y el dolor reprimido, nos agrupamos aquÃ­ hoy para decir unas palabras de despedida al inolvidable amigo y colega Jaime Campos Garrido. Porque quienes lo vieron a su regreso de Europa, hacÃ­a apenas un mes, jamÃ¡s se imaginaron que la muerte irÃ­a a incluirlo en ese terrible listado que en el Ãºltimo semestre se ha llevado a lo mejor de la gastroenterologÃ­a clÃ­nica y quirÃºrgica colombianas, en un desfi le interminable de duelos sucesivos: Alvaro Caro Mendoza, Jaime De la Hoz De la Hoz y ahora Jaime, todos despuÃ©s de coronar las mÃ¡s brillantes carreras que la especialidad y la UniversidadÂ  Nacional avalaron en la Ãºltima mitad del siglo XX, y todos cercados de ese nimbo de prestigio y amistad que hoy nos hace mÃ¡s insoportable y dolorosa su partida.Â 

Nacido de cuna preclara en PopayÃ¡n, Jaime terminÃ³ sus estudios de mÃ©dico en la Universidad Nacional en 1964 y desde sus Ã©pocas de estudiante mostrÃ³ la inclinaciÃ³n por la que irÃ­a a ser su especialidad definitiva. Muy reciÃ©n graduado viajÃ³ To France, where he would specialize for several years in digestive endoscopy; There was soon welcomed by his colleagues who in successive stages will be incorporated into the French National Society of said specialty, as well as the French of Gastroenterología and the Cal President, extraordinary distinction for a young specialist from these latitudes. Upon his return to Bogotã also as a leading internist, he was a founder in 1967 of the Gastroenterología Cãtrad
