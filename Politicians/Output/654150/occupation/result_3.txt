Why did Romania cowardly betray Germany in World War II?

I am not sure I would use “cowardly” here. I mean Nazi Germany was a hyper-authoritarian, Imperialist Empire run a Genocidal sociopath. I am all for Germany being betrayed.

Here is what you need to understand about the Axis in WW2- they weren’t really “friends” or even “allies”. This goes double for the small Axis allies like Romania or Hungary. Germany did not treat Romania like an equal or an all

What did Hitler do when he learned that Mussolini had been captured and executed by his own people during World War 2?

The photo above shows Benito Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci in a Milan morgue. After being hanged upside down from a gas station girder, some gentle soul arranged them in a familial, loving pose.

Adolf Hitler would have heard reports about the Duce's death and accounts of the Italian mob beating, kicking, and urinating on his corpse before the hanging display. Isolated in an underground Berlin bomb shelter, Hitler would not have seen the grisly pictures before his own suicide two days later and only after he showed an awareness of decency by wedding his own mistress Eva Braun.
