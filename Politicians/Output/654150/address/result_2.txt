Geography – Facts and Figures

Switzerland lies in the heart of Europe. Its 41,285km2 surface area can be divided into three distinct geographical regions, including the Alps. They cover two thirds of the country, but only a fraction of the population lives there. Switzerland also shares its borders with five countries and has 6% of Europe's freshwater reserves.

Switzerland lies in the heart of Europe. It shares its 1,935km-long border with five countries: Italy, France, Germany, Austria and the Principality of Liechtenstein.

Switzerland can be divided into three distinct geographical regions. The Alps cover roughly 58% of the country, the Central Plateau around 31% and the Jura 11%. It has 49 four-thousanders – mountain peaks that are 4,000 metres or higher. Although 70% of the national territory is mountainous, only a quarter of the population lives in those regions.


Settlement areas cover around 8% of Switzerland's territory. These include areas given over to housing, infrastructure (trade, industry and transport), water and energy supply, wastewater disposal, as well as green and recreational spaces. Some 36% of Swiss land is used for agriculture, while roughly 30% is covered by forest and woodland. Much of the natural forest re-growth in Switzerland is on former mountain pastures.

Switzerland has around 1,500 lakes which, together with other bodies of water like streams and lakes, account for 4% of the country's surface area. The sources of four of Switzerland’s main rivers – the Rhine, Rhone, Reuss and Ticino – are in the Gotthard massif, in the heart of the Swiss Alps.


The country has 6% of Europe's freshwater reserves. The source of major European rivers like the Rhone, Rhine and Inn is in the Swiss Alps. The Ticino river is a tributary of the Po (Italy), while the Inn flows into the Danube (Germany).
