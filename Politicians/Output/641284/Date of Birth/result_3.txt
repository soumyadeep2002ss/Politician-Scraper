THE EUROPEAN – SECURITY AND DEFENCE UNION
Interview with Ambassador Dr John Paul Grech, 
Deputy Secretary General, Social & Civil Affairs, 
Union for the Mediterranean, Barcelona       
Hartmut Bühl: Ambassador Grech, the Union for the Medi-
terranean (UfM) is an intergovernmental Euro-Mediterranean 
organisation aimed at contributing to regional stability, human 
development and integration: what is the added value of the 
UfM to security and stability? 
John Paul Grech: The UfM was created in 2008.  It is a unique 
inter-governmental organisation, bringing together 43 coun-
tries on an equal footing. These consist of the EU Member 
States and 16 countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediter-
ranean (see box). The main added value of the UfM lies in the 
interrelation created between the policy dimension and its 
operational translation into concrete activities, projects and 
initiatives, with tangible impacts on the region’s citizens. 
Nannette Cazaubon: You are the Deputy Secretary General of 
the UfM in charge of Social and Civil Affairs, which includes 
civil protection. How is your work linked to the European Un-
ion’s efforts in managing disasters and crises?
John Paul Grech: We cooperate closely with the European Com-
mission, in particular with the Directorate-General for European 
Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO). 
The UfM’s engagement with DG ECHO serves as a link and relay 
to promote, amplify and support the EU’s cooperation strategy 
towards the countries of the south and vice versa.
Nannette Cazaubon: Is there any common programme?
John Paul Grech: The EU-funded flagship programme for civil 
protection in the Euro-Mediterranean region is the PPRD South 
(Prevention, Preparedness and Response to natural and man-
made Disasters in EU Southern Neighbourhood countries). 
Since January 2023, it has entered its fourth phase since its 
creation in 2009. In this new variation, it is called PPRD Med 
(2022-2025). 
Hartmut Bühl: What are the priorities and the countries in-
volved, and how does the UfM contribute to PPRD Med?
John Paul Grech: This new phase will focus on new technology 
as well as the strengthening of regional and sub-regional coop-
eration. It concerns ten partner countries in the South (Mauri-
tania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, 
Israel and Palestine). The UfM brings visibility and expertise, 
as well as political support to the project. 
Nannette Cazaubon: Let me ask you for more details about the 
organisation of the UfM. How is the political dimension struc-
tured and the regional cooperation organised?  
John Paul Grech: The specific instrument behind the whole 
UfM rationale are the regional dialogue platforms. These aim 
to establish exchange networks between countries, institutions 
and civil society, through thematic activities emanating from 
the mandate of the organisation. These dialogue platforms 
meet periodically, in stages, supported by working groups 
which feed into their reflections. The platforms give life to new 
ideas, initiatives and projects that are taken up by countries or

MAIN TOPIC Crisis management
other entities, with a view to developing and conducting road-
maps that fit into the UfM’s established priorities and which 
meet the expectations of its different partners. 
Hartmut Bühl: Bringing so many countries around the table is 
not easy to deal with. What are the challenges of this coopera-
tion, and what are the areas where tangible progress has been 
made so far? 
John Paul Grech: The UfM works on the principle of consen-
sus, meaning that projects and initiatives are only agreed 
once all member states have indicated their acceptance, via 
the adoption procedures provided by the UfM Senior Offi-
cials structure which meets on a regular basis. All business 
is conducted following approval through an agreed system 
involving a co-presidency, composed of the EU and represent-
atives of the non-EU Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, a 
role currently undertaken by Jordan. I remain impressed by the 
strong convening power that the organisation has developed 
over the years and of the sense of ownership that all member 
states demonstrate in our day-to-day work. Today the UfM is an 
indispensable inter-governmental organisation to which the EU 
and the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries alike 
refer within the context of implementing the New Agenda for 
the Mediterranean.
Nannette Cazaubon: We have heard that the EU is launching 
several civil protection programmes in the Mediterranean this 
year. Can you tell us more about these programmes and how 
they will be linked to the objectives of the UfM?
John Paul Grech: Indeed, the European Commission will launch 
several programmes this year: 
1. As I already mentioned, a flagship programme entitled 
“Prevention, Preparedness and Response to natural and 
man-made disasters in the Mediterranean” (PPRD Med 
2022-2025) led by the International Science & Technology 
Center (ISTC); 
2. A multi-country study aiming at assessing major risks at 
national and regional levels 2023-2025 led by the Italian 
Civil Protection (DPC), and; 
3. The deployment of technical On-Site Assistance (OSA 2023-
2026), for which Colonel Major Mohamed Ataknit from 
the Tunisian Civil Protection has been appointed as senior 
regional expert. He is based in Tunis and will be supporting 
our cooperation for the next 3 years.  
These actions will complement existing initiatives and tools from 
the European Union Civil Protection Mechanisms (UCPM). They 
aim at further supporting the regional cooperation and long-term 
partnership between the EU, Southern countries and the UfM.
Nannette Cazaubon: From 5-7 June, a high-level event will 
be hosted by the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the 
Dipartamento de Protezione Civile in Rome, co-organised by DG 
ECHO and supported by the UfM General Secretariat. What is 
the focus of this meeting? 
John Paul Grech: This event will focus on three segments: 
1. A high-level panel to exchange and share views on “Climate 
change, Civil protection and Human Security – Towards an 
efficient Euro-Mediterranean Cooperation”.
2. The launch of the PPRD Med – which should provide 
information about the several civil protection regional pro-
grammes planned to take place in the Mediterranean. 
3. The holding of the UfM 2nd Meeting of the Regional Dia-
logue Platform on Civil Protection which should provide an 
early assessment of the outcome of the three UfM Working 
Groups on Preparedness, Prevention and Response, which 
have taken place online over the past few months. 
Hartmut Bühl: What are your personnel expectations for this 
meeting and, more generally, for the future of EU-UFM  
collaboration? 
John Paul Grech: As a start, the high-level event should put 
a political spotlight on the nexus between climate change, 
human security and civil protection, particularly in the light of 
the increasing meteorological and climate catastrophes which 
the Euro-Mediterranean region is currently, and increasingly, 
experiencing, like the recent events in Emilia Romagna, North-
ern Algeria and Jordan among others, but whose incidence 
in the future, according to indications, is bound to increase. 
This should encourage countries in the region to start think-
ing seriously about regional initiatives concerning prevention 
and response, given that in the face of such experiences, it is 
now abundantly clear that no country can deal with them on 
its own. The two other segments of the three-tiered event are 
expected to propose possible solutions on how such challeng-
es can be tackled through regional cooperation and mutual 
support.
Hartmut Bühl: Ambassador Grech, we thank you for your open-
ness and wish you success.
