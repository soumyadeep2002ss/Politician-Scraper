A lighter moment on the podium with the Centre's Director Mr. Christophe Perrin during the 87th Board meeting of the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization. We have reasons to smile, the Centre's Programme and Budget for 2024-25 has been approved. For more information on the Centre's performance in the 2022-23 biennium and its strategy for the next two years go to www.itcilo.org.

Last week, the ITCILO DEVINVEST Team completed a mini-marathon. üèÉ‚ôÇÔ∏è

One which brought together 90+ participants.

üíª Online, we covered the fundamentals of project proposal design for sustainable development with the Summer Global Youth Forum 2023 cohort #SGYF23. 
Changemakers joining us explored ideas to create decent work opportunities in the gig economy; extend access to quality education to the most vulnerable; protect the health of internally displaced persons; address income inequality; and clean our oceans from dangerous pollutants ‚Äì¬†all in service of their local communities. 

üå≥On Campus, we welcomed participants to the Young Leaders Boot Camp and the Rongchang Scholars Training Seminars.

With the Young Leaders, we unpacked the essential skillset of the UN, ILO, IO official: the UN Leadership framework, protocol, negotiation and decision-making skills to give our best as international civil servants.

The Rongchang Scholars from Fudan University joined us to foster their ability to bridge divides across multiple stakeholders, all the while sharpening their analytical and problem-solving skills for an international career. 

My personal benchmark for the success of all courses will consist in meeting these brilliant minds again ‚Äì¬†only, this time, as colleagues. üá∫üá≥

üí≠None of this probing and exploring could have taken place in a vacuum. 
For intellectual, safety and security (!) reasons. 

That's why I'm grateful to colleagues (facilitators, tutors, lecturers) who've come together to turn ideas co-developed with Joel Alcocer into 55 stellar seminar sessions.

Thank you to Nathalie Mirabile for having joined us as special guest lecturer; to Diego Portugal Del Pino and Elisabetta Vitali for joining as key lecturers and co-hosts; to Lesley Cubas, Tiziana Grassone, and Carola Rodia for making each course possible (down to each minute of their implementation), and Francesca Louise Ambrosio and ÈôÜÊÄùÂ©ï LU Sijie for their co-facilitation and overall support. 

Here are a few snaps from July, courtesy of Francesca Ambrosio, LU Sijie and TENG Xiangyu (Fudan University):
