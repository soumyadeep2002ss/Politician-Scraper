We are the training arm of the International Labour Organization

The International Training Centre has been at the forefront of learning and training since 1964. As part of the International Labour Organization, it is dedicated to achieving decent work while exploring the frontiers of the future of work.

Training programmes at the Centre usually last between one week and five weeks, and run by our certified facilitators. Explore our courses, from free self-guided modules to multi-week academies, or learn more about the Turin Learning Approach.

The Centre extends beyond the classroom. Participants gain access to our eCampus platform, virtual reality experiences, hands-on workshops, and much more. Digital certificates are an easy way to prove and share achievements.

We deliver more than just training courses. We guide participants through learning journeys, featuring interactive workshops, virtual collaboration tools, and the latest educational technologies.

Powered by innovation

The core elements of our training programmes are inclusion, impact, and innovation.

Unique structure. The Centre has nearly 50 years of experience in learning and training, as well as collaboration with the United Nations system and other centres of excellence across the globe.
International environment. Even online, the diversity of our participants shines through. Our colorful patchwork of genders, nationalities, and professions is one of the Centre’s greatest strengths — people come from all over the world to learn, network, and practice new skills.
Customizable programmes. Learning happens effortlessly when programmes and pedagogies consider individual needs and local contexts. And lifelong learning lasts longer: the Centre creates a multiplier effect by fostering communities of practice and professional networks.
Certificates and diplomas

The Centre issues three types of credentials – Certificates of Participation, Certificates of Achievement, and Diplomas – on the basis of learning hours and credits.

Certificate of participation. Participants that register for and complete a one-hour course will receive a certificate of participation.
Certificate of achievement. Selected participants that complete a course that lasts between 60 and 300 learning hours, including a final assessment, will receive a certificate of achievement.
Diploma. Selected participants that complete a single or multi-track training activity that lasts a minimum of 300 learning hours, including a capstone project, will receive a diploma.

The ITCILO is committed to transparency and accountability throughout its operations, activities, and decision-making processes. The Centre ensures that its policies and procedures are in line with best practices in the UN system and other public service institutions. 

New measures and revisions of existing rules and procedures include the following:

 

An Ethics Officer has been appointed to foster a culture of integrity and high ethical standards

 

All staff members have agreed to observe the Standards of Conduct for the International Civil Service

 

All staff members are required to make periodic disclosures of conflicts of interests in addition to disclosures of financial interests

The Centre’s procedures will evolve over time. This is an essential part of the Centre’s commitment to enhancing transparency and accountability with regard to governments, employers’ and workers’ organizations, partners in the UN system, the development community, and the public. Changes to rules and procedures are communicated to all staff members.

Donors and partners

The Centre is a nonprofit organization.

The International Labour Organization and the Government of Italy provide core funds. The United Nations, World Bank, European Union, development banks, foundations, and governments provide financial and technical support.

To mobilize voluntary contributions, the Centre maintains close liaison with its traditional development partners, among which the governments of Italy, Portugal, Ireland and Japan are prominent. In addition, the Centre mobilizes voluntary contributions from new development partners; these may include in-kind contributions, such as the temporary secondment of training experts to the Centre.

The Centre manages a global network of development partners, such as professional organizations and training institutions. Staff work with partners to create training programmes that match participants’ needs. 

Tailor-made programmes may be funded by the client organization and/or donor agencies.

The Centre occasionally wins projects through competitive tendering.
