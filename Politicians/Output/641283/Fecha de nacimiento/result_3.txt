Union for the Mediterranean



The Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) is an intergovernmental Euro-Mediterranean organization which brings together all 28 countries of the European Union and 15 countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. The UfM has consolidated an action-driven methodology with a common ambition of creating effective links between the policy dimension and its operational translation into concrete projects and initiatives on the ground to adequately address the challenges of the region and its key interrelated priorities. This methodology is composed of three components: political fora, dialogue platforms and regional projects - namely the "Three Ps".
