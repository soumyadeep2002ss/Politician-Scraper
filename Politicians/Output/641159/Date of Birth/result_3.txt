Toledo is a municipality and Spanish city, capital of the homonymous province, in the Autonomous Community of Castilla-La Mancha. With a population of 86,070 inhabitants (INE 2023), it is the third most populated municipality in the region. The historic center is located on the right bank of the Tagus, in a hill surrounded by a pronounced Meandro. The municipal term includes two neighborhoods far apart from the main nucleus: that of Azucaica, on the right bank of the river, and that of Santa María de Benquencia, practically in front of the previous one on the left bank.

The city was an important folding center until the Roman conquest in 193 a. C. After the Germanic invasions, Toledo would become capital of the Visigothic kingdom and, subsequently, in its main ecclesiastical headquarters. In 711, Toledo was conquered by the Muslims, whose domain ended with the taking of the city in 1085 by Alfonso VI. It is known as "the imperial city" for having been the main headquarters of the Court of Carlos I6 and also as "the city of the three cultures", 7 for having been populated for centuries by Christians, Jews and Muslims. In the 16th century, the war of the communities of Castile took place and the transfer in 1561 of the Court to Madrid, after which the city entered into decline, accentuated by the economic crisis of the moment. Already in contemporary times, the siege and defense of the Alcázar is remembered during the civil war. In 1983, Toledo became host of the Regional Courts and the Community Board of Castilla-La Manchaa and in 1986 its historic center was declared a World Heritage Site.

At present, the vast majority of the population is dedicated to the services sector, with local tradition in the manufacture of swords. A Avant rail line connects Toledo and Madrid in 33 minutes. It has various sanitary infrastructure, including the National Hospital of Paraplegics, and with the presence of the Infantry Academy.

Toponymy [edit]

The first written source where Toletum appears is the work of theRoman historian Tito Livio, according to which toletum would originate in Tollitum, which would give Tollitu, Tollito, Tolleto, Tolledo until he was in Toledo. Its meaning would be "raised, high." Martín Gallego collects the version of «The double or rivers laps that forms the river that cines it». The writer of the 12th century, Abú Ab-Dín al-Ayubí, affirms that طليطلة Tulaytulah means "the cheerful", without giving more explanation. The different historical names received by the city were: in Latin toletum; In Arabic طليطلة (Tulaytulah), in JudeoEspañol טולדות (awdoth) and in Mozarabic Tolétho.8

They are named after Toledo five cities in the United States, in the states of Ohio, Illinois, Oregon, Iowa and Washington; Other seven of Canada, Belize, Brazil, Portugal, Colombia, Philippines and Uruguay and four more nuclei in Spain in the provinces of Huesca, Orense, Asturias and Tenerife.

Toledo shield at the new hinge door

One of Toledo's nicknames, the "city of the three cultures", related to a past in which Christian, Jewish and Muslims in the town coexisted, has been qualified as "pomposo" and attributed mainly to "politicians and operators Tourism », highlighting that behind that myth of peaceful religious coexistence there would be a reality of religious oppression.9

Configuration [edit]

The ancient urban center is lying on the right bank of the Tajo River, in a hill of one hundred meters high on it, which marries it by its base, forming a pronounced meandro known as the Tagus. The point that this meandro does not close is the only natural entrance that the city has, on which the roads that link the city with Madrid and Ávila were built.

Partial aerial view of the city

Since the mid -nineteenth century the expansion began outside the walls; First in the surroundings of the Railroad Station to definitively take off since the late 1940s by La Vega del Tajo, with the construction of the labor town13 of the National Arms Factory and especially following the axis that formed the N-403 road . Since the early 1960s, the expansion of this Vega was further accentuated, following the construction of the Social Security Health Residence.

In the 1970s, with the creation by the Ministry of Housing of the Decongestion Polygon of Madrid (today neighborhood of Santa María de Benquencia) the expansion of the urban nucleus begins following the left bank of the river on the N-400 road , until becoming the most populous neighborhood in the entire municipality.

The historic center at dusk

At present, the Municipality of Toledo has a very dispersed configuration, there are neighborhoods separate from the main nucleus of the city by wide open spaces, as is the case with the neighborhoods of Santa María de Benquencia or Azucaica, an old district located on the right bank of the Tagus , which are separated from the city around six kilometers. The development of the peripheral neighborhoods has simultaneously caused a gradual abandonment of the old walled enclosure when the population moved to the new neighborhoods born since the 1960s.

Main article: Toletum
Cerro del Bu

The first fixed settlement that is known in the city of Toledo is a series of castros, on which the city folderly walled, one of the most important centers of the folders. Among the first known settlements in the area is the hill of the BU, located on the left shore of the Tajo River, a deposit that has various overlapping stages, one of them dated in the Bronze Age.22 23 B

In 193 a. C. And after great resistance, Marco Fulvio Nobilior conquered the city. The Romans rebuilt her and called her toletum, in the province of Carpetania. The city developed an important iron industry that led her to coin currency. The area where the city settled suffered a deep process of Romanization, as attesting to the numerous remains of Roman villas, especially on the Tagus banks.

Roman remains next to the hermitage of Christ of Light

The Romans left numerous vestiges in the Toledo Faz, as an imposing aqueduct, which only the bases are preserved on both sides of the Tagus, a Roman route, part of which can be seen on the slopes of the hills of the left bank of the left margin of the River, and a circus (with capacity for about 13,000-15 000 spectators), located in a public park and parcIarly unearthed. There are many other vestiges that, despite being disappeared in many cases, it is very likely that they are in the subsoil of the city, such as the theater (located on the immediate lot of the circus and that currently occupies a school), the Amphitheater (under the Covachuelas neighborhood), an important hydraulic infrastructure (such as the vestiges that remain next to the door where the Mosque of the Christ of Light is accessed), numerous roads (as recently found at approximately seven meters deep under the garden of the mentioned mosque), as well as hot springs, spillways and villas.

It should be noted that most of these historical constructions were dismantled, being the ashlars used for the construction of other buildings and for the wall surrounding the city, although possibly the greatest archaeological wealth of Toledo is buried under its subsoil.

Middle Ages [edit]
Main articles: Visigoth kingdom of Toledo and Taifa de Toledo.
III Council of Toledo (589)

After the first Germanic incursions, the ancient walls with defensive objectives were rebuilt; Despite this in the year 411 the city was conquered by the Alans thanks to its imposing mastery of the horse and their war arts, who were in turn defeated by the Visigoths in the year 418. Once he had defeated his rival Agila , Atanagildo established his cut in the city and later, with Leovigildo, he became the capital of the Hispanogodo kingdom and archbishopric, which acquired great civil and religious importance (as the councils of Toledo prove) reaching the 10,000 inhabitants ( which placed it among the largest Hispanic cities of the time). Very close to Toledo, in the town of Guadamur, the Guarrazar Treasury, exceptional set of votive crowns of the Visigoth kings was found.

In 711 she was conquered by Táriq Ibn Ziyad and subject to Muslim domain. The taking of the city was carried out without difficulties, through capitulation, since much of the population had fled.24 The Arabs called it tulaytula (in Arabic طليطلة).

The predominance of a large Mozarabic population immediately made it a focus of continuous concern for Córdoba. In 79725 C during the Emirate of Alhakén I, an uprising against Córdoba broke out. According to certain chronicles - there are various versions about the event - the emir would have sent the Muladí Amrús Ben Yusufd to submit the city. Amrús decimated the local muladíes through the known as "moon day": in a banquet in the governor's palace where he invited the main muladíes of the city to eat, they would have been murdering these as they entered and their bodies thrown into A ditch However, they rebelled again in 811 and 829, after their death. It is said that from these facts the expression of having a "Toledo Night" could have been born .25

Finally, Abd Al-Rahman III crushed the endemic rebellion of the city of Toledo in July 932, after a siege of two years, subjecting it to the Cordoba caliphate. When the caliphate disintegrated in the eleventh century, Toledo became an important kingdom of Taifa, which nevertheless had to pay out parishes to the kings of Castileto maintain its independence.

Alfonso VI entrance in Toledo (1085)

After years of siege, the city is subsequently subjected and it is surrendered on May 6, 1085. Days later, on May 25, Alfonso VI de León enters Toledo, after a previous agreement with the King of the Taifa who ruled her. Through the capitulation agreement, King Leonese submits to the kingdom, guaranteeing Muslim settlers the safety of their people and property. The king granted his own for each of the existing minorities: Mozarabes (Toledo was an important Mozarabic center, with his own liturgy, the Hispanic-Mozarabrabe, which is still preserved), Muslims and Jews, subsequently recast by Alfonso VII in the jurisdiction of 1118. After the capitulation of the city, the period of greatest splendor of Toledo, of great cultural, social and political intensity. The School of Translators of Toledo, flourishing during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as well as the numerous civil and religious works of art, which left an important mark in the city.

After the capitulation, the religious practice of the Jewish and Muslim communities was tolerated, but this tolerant attitude did not last long. The Christians built the new cathedral on the major mosque, which in turn rose on the former Visigoth cathedral.

In 1162 the city was conquered by King Fernando II of León, during the convulsive period of the minority of Alfonso VIII of Castile. King Leon appointed Fernando Rodríguez de Castro «El Castellano», member of the house of Castro, governor of the city. The city of Toledo remained in the hands of the Leon until 1166, in which it was recovered by the Castilians.27

During the Castilian civil war, Toledo fought next to Pedro I and, after suffering a long siege, it was taken in January 1369. Throughout the Middle Ages the city was growing: in the fourteenth century it received a fair privilege and in the XV century became one of the main Castilian scarf producers, an activity that joined the existing coin coin, manufacture of weapons and seede. In 1492, the Jews are expelled and the Catholic Monarchs reinforce the city. Isabel la Católica built there, in the monastery of San Juan de los Reyes, which she wanted was her grave, but was finally buried with her husband in the Cathedral of Granada. Carlos I turned Toledo into the Imperial City and the Court headquarters.6 28

Modern Age [edit]

The Catholic Monarchs urbanized and enhanced the city, and in the Toledo Cathedral, Juana and Felipe El Hermoso were proclaimed as heirs of the Castilian crown in 1502. Active participation in the unification of the first modern state in Europe had the noble Castilians, especially the aristocratic Family of the Álvarez de Toledo, whose power increased under royal power. Isabel la Católica ordered to build in Toledo the monastery of San Juan de los Reyes to commemorate the battle of Toro and be buried there with her husband, but after the reconquest of Granada the Kings decided to bury themselves in this last city, where her remains rest today.

Toledo in the sixteenth century (Civitates Orbis Terrarum, 1572)

Sword industry [edit]

The manufacture of swords in the city of Toledo dates back to Roman times, more specifically to the times of the Republic, when their swords and knives were famous and famous, as the poet Gracio Falisco attests to his work Cynegeticum.41 but it was Under the Arab domination and during the reconquest when Toledo and his sprinkler guilds played a fundamental role. Between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries the industry related to the manufacture of swords had a great boom in Toledo to the point that the Toledana swords industry became considered the best in Europe. The production of white weapons was personal and was carried out by small scattered artisans, although the swapped guild watched over the final quality of the products.

Former Toledo's white weapons factory (the Universal Museum, 1863)

At the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century, the decline of production began, which motivated the creation of one of the Royal Factories, the Toledo Arms Factory, in 1761 by mandate of King Carlos III. In the Royal Factory all the city's swords unions gathered and was located in the old house of La Moneda. In 1777, given the need to expand the space, Carlos III ordered the building to the architect Sabatini on the outskirts of the city. From there begins its expansion that goes through different stages. Its importance was such that it became a city within Toledo himself.

During the twentieth century, the production of white weapons for the troop was reduced exclusively to cavalry weapons and, after the civil war, to the supply of sabers to officers and non -commissioned officers of the different bodies.
