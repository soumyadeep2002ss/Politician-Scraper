The councilor for celebrations and youth, José Vicente García-Toledano has shown his satisfaction today to the success of the first edition of the Christmas program ‘Follow the star of Toledo’. A success "in all the senses," said the councilor, who stressed that both the lighting and the quality of the activities, "has attracted large audiences to our city."

This has been pointed out by the Councilor for Celebrations in a press conference with the Councilor for Economic Promotion and Employment, Juan Marín and the Councilor for Tourism, Housing and Relations with the UCLM, José Manuel Velasco; in which they have made a Christmas balance 2023-2024.

In addition, according to the councilor of celebrations, “we must highlight the absolute full at the El Greco Congresses Palace with the Royal Raya Concert and the Pica-Pica show; The activities of the Rojas Theater; The polygon fair or musicals in infants or Marist schools. ”

But he also highlighted the great success of the bells in the Plaza de Zocodover; The projection of the light and sound show ‘Toledo has star’ and finally, the ride of the Magi on January 5 “which passed normally and without incident and that recovered the tradition of climbing to the historic center”.

At this point, García-Tooldano has advanced that next year the SSMM ride in the East will also have two sections without noise, adapted for children suffering from an autistic spectrum disorder (TEA).

A great success, the councilor has reiterated "of which I feel very proud, because we have shown that with imagination, talent, organization and management you can do great things."

For his part, Juan Marín has referred to the 'bridge to bridge' initiative, whose objective was to “expand the spaces, diversify the Christmas offer so that all tourism would not be concentrated at one point, and with that perspective we established the Markets at the San Martín bridge and in Alcántara, that has been a public success. ”

In addition, the possibility of visiting the towers "has led to the approximate even more public to these two points," said the Councilor for Economic Promotion and Employment, so the global assessment "is very positive."

"The Toledo were delighted to be able to access spaces that until now were not open to the public," added Marín, who now studies the possibility that torrels can be visited at other times of the year, in addition to Christmas.
