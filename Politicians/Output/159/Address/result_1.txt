Politics of IndiaPolitical partiesElections

The Mizoram People's Conference is a regional political party in Mizoram, India. It was formed by Brig Thenphunga Sailo on 17 April 1975.[2] Ṭhenphunga was the party chairman and Chief Minister of Mizoram from 1979 to 1984, and an army officer and then a human rights activist before starting his political party.

Following the MPC's defeat in 1984, it was the main opposition party for the next two decades.[2] In the 1998 assembly elections, it won 12 seats.[2] However, in the 2003 elections, the party won only three seats, a number which fell to two in the 2008 elections and one in 2013.[2] It ultimately won four seats in the 2018 election and their MLA quit to join Zoram People's Movement (ZPM).[2][3] MPC was the third largest party in Mizoram for three decades. It merged with the People's Representation for Identity and Status of Mizoram (PRISM) party as the People’s Conference Party.[2]

In June 2019, MPC left ZPM.
