toppled through defections, became the Chief Minister in 1988. He continued the office after being re-elected in the 1989 and 1993 elections. In 1998 he lost the election. He eventually reclaimed in the 2003 elections.[8][9][11][10]

In the 2013 Mizoram Assembly Elections, Thanhawla led the ruling Congress party to a victory winning 34 seats in the 40-member legislative assembly, two seats more than in the 2008 election. The major opposition party Mizo National Front (MNF) barely won five seats, while Mizoram People's Conference (MPC) won just one seat. In the 2018 Mizoram Assembly Elections, he lost the election for the second time.[3][12]

In November 2021, Thanhawla announced his voluntary retirement from party leadership, saying to The Indian Express: "Politics is in my blood and I can never shrug it off. But I do think it is high time that I make way for someone younger. I am a grand old man now."[6] President of INC, Sonia Gandhi formally accepted his resignation on 4 December. The next day, Gandhi appointed him as a member of the Congress Working Committee, and Lalsawta as the new President of MPCC.[13][14]

Controversies[edit]
Graft case[edit]

In 1995, officials of the Income Tax Department investigated a case of tax evasion by the Baid group, which operated a travel agency Capital Travels (Capital Tours (India) Pvt. Ltd.), in northeast India. On 13 September, they found a link of swindling government funds between Jodhraj Baid, head of the Baid group operating in Mizoram, Lal Thanhawla, the Chief Minister, and Santosh Mohan Dev, the Union Minister.[21][22] Based on this evidence, two social workers, Zairema and Bualhranga filed a public interest litigation to the Supreme Court of India in 1996.[23][24] The case file accused Thanhawla with Baid and Pushpa Sharma, an accountant of Baid, of corruption arising from disproportionate income and assets. Investigation was carried out by the anti-corruption wing of the Mizoram police from 1998,[22] and P. Singthanga, Special Judge of the Prevention of Corruption Act, was appointed as the prosecutor.[25] On 25 April 2003, a chargesheet was submitted by John Neihlaia, Commandant of the First Battalion of the Mizoram Armed Police, upon which the court ordered for an arrest. But Thanhawla had already obtained anticipatory bail in the previous December, so evaded jail. Baid and Sharma were detained in jail for a day until they got the bail. The first trial held in August 2003 found evidence of corruption.[26]

In June 2006, Jodhraj Baid submitted a petition to Gauhati High Court on the incompetency of Singthanga, and subsequently to the Supreme Court, both of which dismissed the petitions.[25] Thanhawla appeared before Singthanga in September and was again charge-sheeted.[22] After several court hearings, T. Saikunga, special judge of a District and Sessions Court, dissolved Thanhawla's case on 26 February 2010 on the grounds that "there was no clear evidence" of money laundering.[23]

Declaration case[edit]

When Lal Thanhawla filed candidature for the 2013 Mizoram Legislative Assembly from two constituencies, Serchhip and Champhai South, in which he failed to declare an immovable property.[27] As his Chief Minister term was closing in 2018, his nomination papers were re-examined by Lalhriatrenga Chhangte, Deputy Controller of Mines at Indian Bureau of Mines in Kolkata, who knew that Thanhawla owns a plot of land in Kolkata, which did not appear in the property declaration.[28] By then Thanhawla had been constructing a building in that land. Chhangte submitted corruption charges of Thanhawla under Section 125 A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, on 17 January 2018 to the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Serchhip District.[29] The accusation also included inconsistent date of birth declared by Thanhawla in the election papers.[30] Thanhawla made excuses and did not appear before the court in the first two summons in March and April 2018,[31] as his counsel Remsanga Nghaka reported "personal problems."[32] Chhangte also filed a case to the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) of Mizoram Police on 20 May 2018. The Vigilance Department, which was under Thanhawla, failed to issue permission for investigation.[28]

On his first appearance before the court on 26 May, the Chief Judicial Magistrate Lalngaihmawia Zote acquitted Thanhawla of the age issue as the period of verification for election had lapsed.[30][33] On the case of land ownership, he claimed that it was allotted to him by the Bengal government as a gift when the Kolkata New Town was expanded in 2011, and that ownership deeds were still officially uncertain in 2013 due to legal issues in that area.[34] He then evaded several court summons under various excuses.[28] The next year on 3 October 2019, he appeared before the court which gave a him a benefit of doubt for the ownership procedures and dismissed the case on account of lack of "evidence of mens rea." The court however declared that he was the legal owner of the land.[34]
