New unit heads confirmed at summer Council meeting
It was an eventful summer Council meeting on 2-3 July this year. As well as Jan Ellenberg taking over
Eric Karsenti’s role as head of the Cell Biology and Biophysics unit from 2010, it was confirmed that
Lars Steinmetz and Eileen Furlong will be joint heads of Gene Expression from the beginning of 2009.
Council also confirmed the promotion of Carsten Schultz to senior scientist, approved the salary adjust-
ments as of July and heard a presentation about Australia, its institutes, research infrastructure and
funding bodies from Australian delegates Jessie Borthwick and Edwina Cornish.page 2

Newsletter of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
You’re never too young – or too old – to learn about  science.  While  the Kinderhaus
embarks on a hunt to find a scientific mentor to help the children with a series of fun
experiments (left), EMBL staff and scientists have been getting involved in a science com-
munication venture aimed at all ages –the third European Science Open Forum (ESOF)
meeting in Barcelona. Attracting thousands scientists, teachers, politicians, media and
outreach people from all over
Europe,  the  biennial  meeting
makes  the  latest  hot  topics
accessible to all with seminars,
discussion forums and hands-
on activities (right).page 4

Unravelling the mystery of cot death 
EMBL researchers have come a step closer to understanding Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a
condition that unexpectedly takes the lives of babies aged between a month and a year. Cornelius Gross
and his group at EMBL Monterotondo developed a mouse model of SIDS by overexpressing the sero-
tonin 1A autoreceptor in the brainstem, where SIDS victims show alterations in neurons containing
serotonin. This proved sufficient to cause sudden death in the mice, and the group now hopes that ulti-
mately it will give new ideas to doctors about how to diagnose babies at risk of SIDS.page 5
A passage to India
Discussions are underway about a proposal for a consortium of EMBL, the European Synchrotron
Radiation Facility (ESRF) and the Indian government to take over the running of the BM14 beamline
at the ESRF in Grenoble. The bending magnet beamline is currently owned by UK MRC and is run in
partnership with EMBL, but that contract is due to end soon. At the March meeting EMBL, ESRF and
the Indian Department of Biotechnology (DBT) made a preliminary agreement to take over and run the
MX experimental station from 1 January 2010 for five years. page 3

here was important news about the organ-
isation of EMBL from this year’s summer
Council meeting on 2-3 July in Heidelberg.
Cell Biology and Biophysics unit head Eric
Karsenti’s  departure  was  announced  earlier
this  year,  but  it  was  confirmed  that  Jan
Ellenberg  will  take  over  Eric’s  role  as  from
2010. In 2009, they will act as joint heads.
With Jan vacating the role of head of unit of
Gene  Expression,  Lars  Steinmetz  and  Eileen
Furlong will be appointed joint heads from the
beginning of 2009. “Lars and Eileen have spear-
headed both the organisation and experimental
use  of  high-throughput  functional  genomic
methodologies at EMBL, and this decision not
only  recognises  their  excellent  scientific  per-
formance, but also my conviction that this sci-
entific direction is one that EMBL should pur-
sue vigorously,” said EMBL DG Iain Mattaj.
Council  also  approved  the  promotion  of
Carsten  Schultz  to  senior  scientist  to  reflect
EMBL’s increase in chemical biology activities:
it  now  has  a  small  molecule  screening  core
facility,  two  chemistry  groups  in  Gene
Expression – one with a strong focus on chem-
istry in Structural and Computational Biology
– and rapidly increasing activities at the EBI on
small molecule–macromolecule interactions. 
Other points covered at the Council meeting:
• Matthias  Hentze  reported  that  the  ATC
building  is  proceeding  according  to  plan
and  within  budget.  The  topping-out  cere-
mony for the builders will be 25 September
this year, and the official opening ceremony
will be 15 October 2009. 
• Australian delegates Jessie Borthwick from
the  Australian  government  and  Edwina
Cornish  from  Monash  University  gave  a
presentation  about  the  country,  its  major
institutes, research infrastructure and fund-
ing bodies. 
• For  the  first  time,  an  observer  from  the
European  Commission,  Manuel  Hallen,
Director of Health at DG Research, was in
attendance at the meeting, on the invitation
of Council.
• EBI Director and ELIXIR project leader Janet
Thornton  gave  an  introduction  to  ELIXIR,
which  will  develop  a  strategy  for  a  pan-
European  infrastructure  for  biological
information. Nigel Watts, chair of EMBL
Council’s  ELIXIR  working  group  and
also the UK delegate, gave a summary of
the  first  two  working  group  meetings
and  outlined  some  possible  legal  and
organisational structures for ELIXIR. 
• The salary adjustment as of July 2008
will  be  1.6%  in  Heidelberg  and
Hamburg;  1.0%  in  Grenoble;  1.5%  in
Monterotondo and 1.1% at the EBI (see
box, below). 
• The  chair  of  the  working  group  on
terms  and  conditions  of  employment,
the  Dutch  delegate  Jeanette  Ridder-
Numan, provided an interim report of
their work comparing specific aspects of the
employment conditions at EMBL with other
organisations  to  ensure  that  the  employ-
ment conditions at EMBL are comparable.
The  working  group  will  present  its  final
report to Council in November. 
• The EMBL budget was approved for 2009. 
• Favourable  SAC  reviews  of  Monterotondo
and the Gene Expression unit were present-
ed by the chair of SAC, Paul Nurse, who will
stand down at the end of the year. Werner
Kühlbrandt will be the chair in 2009.
• Council  delegates  Jean-Claude  Pernollet
(France),  Marianne  Sommarin  and  Brita
Beije (Sweden) are stepping down, and they
were thanked for all their work.

July is everyone’s favourite month at EMBL,
because  our  salary  slips  show  the  increase
that has been granted by the member states
at the summer Council meeting. 
EMBL’s  salary  increase  consists  of  two
parts: the annual step increase and the salary
adjustment.  The  automatic  step  increase,
which  is  very  unusual  in  publicly-funded
organisations, represents a salary increase of
roughly 2.25% per year. 
The salary adjustment (the percentages cir-
culated after the summer Council meeting) is
calculated based on a combination of factors:
a)  the weighted average of the pay rise for
civil  servants  in  Europe’s  strongest
economies;
b) The annual change in the consumer price
index – a measure of the average price of
consumer  goods  purchased  – for  the
individual country;
c) A   correction   for   imbalances   in
Purchasing  Power  Parities  – what  your
salary is worth – between the host coun-
tries.  This  factor  is  calculated  using
OECD figures.
All  of  these  factors  reflect  the  economic
situation in the different member states over
the period of the year preceeding the time of
calculation. 
When seen over multiple years, the combi-
nation  of  mechanisms  keeps  salary  levels
considerably  above  inflation,  even  if  there
can occasionally be a year or two when infla-
tion  is  higher  than  the  combined  salary
increase. 
EMBL Council makes every attempt to use
external  evaluations  in  order  to  treat  all
EMBL employees, at all five sites, as fairly as
possible.

A passage to India
D
iscussions are underway about a proposal
for a consortium of EMBL, the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) and the
Indian government to take over the running of
the BM14 beamline at the ESRF in Grenoble. 
An Indian delegation of governmental advis-
ers and top researchers from institutes in New
Delhi,  Mumbai  and  the  International  Centre
for  Genetic  Engineering  and  Biotechnology
(ICGEB)  visited  EMBL  Grenoble  on  25-26
March, and at the summer council meeting in
July, EMBL Council was informed that discus-
sions in India and at ESRF are ongoing in the
hope that a positive decision about the propos-
al will be made by the end of the year.
The  bending  magnet  beamline  at  ESRF  is
currently  owned  by  UK  MRC  and  is  run  in
partnership  with  EMBL,  which  contributes
staff and expertise in exchange for 20% of the
beamtime, but that contract is due to end soon.
At the March meeting EMBL, ESRF and the
Indian  Department  of  Biotechnology  (DBT)
made  a  preliminary  agreement  to  take  over
and  run  the  macromolecular  crystallography
(MX)  experimental  station  from  1  January
2010 for five years. 
The  agreement  has  several  advantages:  as
well as securing the continuation of this state-
of-the-art,  specialised  Multiple  Anomalous
Diffraction  (MAD)  beamline, it  will  also
strengthen links with the Indian MX commu-
nity, which is one of the most important and
active in the emerging nations. As India hasn’t
got a modern synchrotron, the consortium will
provide access to the facility to structural biol-
ogists from the country, and boost research on
health-related issues prevailing there. In addi-
tion, the ICGEB, an international organisation
based in New Delhi which conducts research
in  life  sciences  for  the  benefit  of  developing
countries, will also be part of the consortium.
Most of its member state MX scientists only
have indirect access to synchrotrons via collab-
orations.
EMBL Grenoble beamline scientist Hassan
Belrhali, who played a major role in initiating
the project, said: “There are very good scientif-
ic reasons to keep BM14 operational. It’s also a
great  opportunity  to  promote  scientific
exchange between Europe and that part of the
world.”

T
he  new  interactive  EMBL  PhD  students
portal, http://predocs.embl.org, is up and
running and waiting for your content!
Set up and maintained by Heidelberg PhD
students  Evangelia  Petsalaki,  Claudia  Chica,
Beat Rupp and Marco Faini, it was created with
incoming predocs in mind. The original idea of
providing  newcomers’  information  for  each
EMBL location has expanded to include inter-
active  forums  on  topics  relevant  not  only  to
predocs but to other staff members at all EMBL
sites. Designed and developed by web architect
Francesco  Sottile,  the wiki  site  allows  regis-
tered users to provide content and keep it up-
to-date themselves. 
So register now (it’s free, of course) and start
sharing your ideas, worries and second-hand
ski gear with everyone else. It’s also a great way
of  keeping  in  touch  with  predocs  and  other
staff at other EMBL locations. 
Here are some ideas about to make the most of
the site:
• Start a Forum topic about anything that’s on
your mind. Worried about your TAC? Want
to know how to apply for funding? Scared of
your group leader? Get it off your chest!
• Start  a  blog!  You  could  meet  some  like-
minded people and form a collaboration or
discussion group.
• Finishing your thesis and leaving EMBL is a
stressful enough time for a predoc, but hav-
ing  to  get  rid  of  your  flat  and  car  as  well
makes it even more of a hassle. Pass on your
worldly  goods  smoothly  and  easily  to  an
incoming PhD student with the accommo-
dation and shop forums.
• Anyone  from  any  EMBL  site  can  register,
and it’s not just for predocs. Other staff just
won’t be able to access some predoc areas.
Liliana  Minichiello’s  team  at  EMBL
Monterotondo has discovered that mouse
mothers-to-be have a remarkable way to
protect their unborn pups.
The researchers discovered how preg-
nant mice, who are in danger of miscar-
riage  when  exposed  to  the  scent  of  a
strange  male’s  urine,  prevent  this  by
blocking their smell. A surge of the chem-
ical signal dopamine in the main olfacto-
ry bulb creates a barrier to male odours.
The male urine scent affects early preg-
nancy in mice by inhibiting the release of
the pregnancy hormone prolactin, a phe-
nomenon  that’s  often  called  the  Bruce
effect  and  creates  a  mating  opportunity
for the alien male. Liliana and her team
have now revealed the molecular mecha-
nism that underpins the change in sensi-
tivity  to  male  odours  – which  starts  3
days after conception in mice, when los-
ing the embryos would become danger-
ous  – in  the  20  July  issue  of Nature
Neuroscience.  Treating  pregnant  mice
with chemicals that block the dopamine
receptor D2 abolished the barrier effect,
restored odour sensing and allowed mis-
carriage.
While  human  mothers-to-be  often
report  unusual  reactions  to  smells,
human  pregnancy  is  not  thought  to  be
affected  by  strange  male  odours.  These
results,  however,  could  offer  a  step
towards understanding why some women
in early pregnancy find themselves run-
ning for cover when they catch a whiff of
usually delicious aromas such as coffee.
“It could give clues as to why many preg-
nant women report changes in smell sen-
sitivity,” says first author Che Serguera.

T
he Kinderhaus at EMBL Heidelberg is
looking for a scientific ‘mentor’ to help
the kids with life sciences projects.
The Kinderhaus has recently signed up to
the  nationwide  “Haus  der  Kleinen
Forscher” (“Tiny Tots Science Corner”) ini-
tiative,  which  is  sponsored  by  Helmholtz-
Gemeinschaft,  Siemens  AG,  the  Dietmar
Hopp Stiftung and McKinsey & Company,
and  aims  to  get  three-  to  six-year-olds  in
day-care facilities excited about the natural
sciences with experiments and workshops.
The  initiative  offers  free  training  pro-
grammes to the teachers to help them take
ideas back to the classroom, but participat-
ing day-care centres are also encouraged to
find a willing mentor with a background in
science. He or she would advise the teach-
ers,  answer  their  questions,  visit  the
Kinderhaus to talk about his or her work,
provide  new  ideas  for  additional  experi-
ments or do the experiments with the chil-
dren themselves.
The mentor would be needed to take part
just  once  a  month,  and  Kinderhaus  head
Florence  Beye  would  welcome  volunteers
from EMBL, whether at the predoc stage or
beyond. “The person wouldn’t have to pre-
pare spectacular experiments every time –
he  or  she  could  also  do  other  things  like
simply showing the children a laboratory or
some  scientific  instruments,”  she
says. 
The  children  have  already  been
involved in one scientific session. On
3  June,  the  initiative’s  ‘Action  Day’,
the younger children made delicious
orange and apple ice lollies using salt
and ice instead of a freezer, and the
older children put ink and water in
test tubes and froze them to demon-
strate  that  water  expands  when  it’s
ice. 
If you’d like to volunteer your serv-
ices  as  a  scientific  mentor,  you  can
get  in  touch  with  Florence  at
beye@embl.de.
Starting them young: could you be a mentor?
Creating a new resource
E
MBL Monterotondo and the EBI are join-
ing  forces  to  start  a  “zoo”  of  Cre  mouse
resources (see box, right).
A   new   FP7   coordinated   action,
‘Coordination  of  resources  for  conditional
expression  of  mutated  mouse  alleles’  (CRE-
ATE) involves other institutes from Europe,
Australia and Japan as well as the two EMBL
units.
Coordinated  by  Nadia  Rosenthal  at
EMBL  Monterotondo,  CREATE  will  dis-
seminate  information  on  Cre  mouse
resources  via  an  international  database,
CreZOO. This will capture existing knowl-
edge  about  different  types  of  conditional
knockout  mice,  including  their  genetic
construction, background, expression pat-
terns and activity according to a single set
of standards.
Ewan Birney at the EBI will be respon-
sible  for  the  database,  and  the  institute
will also host a new web portal, Cre8, through
which methods and technologies for improv-
ing Cre-mediated recombination in vivocan be
accessed. 
Another major goal of CREATE is to define
the  needs  of  the  mouse  research  community
via a forum, CreExpress.
Left: Aarush Sinha gets to grips with
the ink experiment
What’s that?
A Cre mouse is genet-
ically  engineered  to  express  the  CRE  enzyme
only  in  a  specific  organ  or  tissue  (conditional
expression). When a Cre mouse is crossed with
another mouse that has a critical sequence in the
target gene flanked by so-called loxP sites (small
stretches  of  bacterial  DNA  not  present  in  the
mouse  genome),  the  CRE  enzyme  in  the  off-
spring will recognise the loxP site present in the
same cells, loop out the intervening  DNA and
rejoin the two loxP sites. Deleting the targeted
sequence  inactivates  the  gene  in  specific  cell
types and creates a conditional knockout mouse.

D
ie Zeitjournalist Martin Spiewak spent a
day at the main lab on 20 June to research
his entertaining portrait of EMBL, ‘Zauberberg
der Wissenschaft’, for the newspaper’s special
supplement on European research on 24 July.
The edition tied in with the third European
Science Open Forum (ESOF) meeting on 18-22
July in Barcelona, at which EMBL had lots of
visibility. Staff members hosted sessions on sci-
ence communication and education, and DG
Iain  Mattaj  chaired  a  discussion  on  research
infrastructures. EMBL was also represented in
the exhibition area as a partner organisation of
EIROforum, who welcomed countless interest-
ed questions at their large stand. 
The  biggest  gathering  of  scientists,  politi-
cians,  media  and  outreach  people  in  Europe,
ESOF  attracted  more  than  4,000  participants
this  year,  who  heard  about  global  warming,
human nutrition, the human mind, body engi-
neering and many more hot topics in science.
As  well  as  scientific  sessions  and  hands-on
exhibitions,  there  were  entertaining  and
informative  outreach  events  too,  which  even
included drama and dance productions. 
“ESOF is a very valuable meeting in many
ways. You meet familiar faces, you get to know
interesting new ones and you learn a lot about
other scientific areas, not just the life sciences,”
said one visitor. “It’s very inspiring and it gave
me plenty of new ideas for my work.”

MBL  men:  they’re  handsome,  they’re  strong,  they’re  good  at
science  – and  they’re  not  bad  at  fathering,  either,  if  this  year’s
summer party is anything to go by. So
here, for the delight of the ladies, is a
montage of EMBL chaps showing off
their parenting skills...
The EMBL Summer Party: 
a celebration of fatherhood
Unravelling the mystery of cot death
I
t’s every parent’s nightmare – but now EMBL
researchers have come a step closer to under-
standing  Sudden  Infant  Death  Syndrome
(SIDS), otherwise known as cot or crib death.
Cornelius  Gross  and  his  group  at  EMBL
Monterotondo have developed a mouse model
of  SIDS,  a  condition  that  unexpectedly  takes
the  lives  of  seemingly  healthy  babies  aged
between a month and a year. 
The  group  concentrated  on  the  brainstem,
the lower part of the brain that forms the link
to the spinal cord, where victims of SIDS show
alterations in neurons containing the signalling
molecule serotonin. In the mice, they modified
the serotonin system there by overexpressing
serotonin  1A  autoreceptor.  Their  findings,
published in the 4 July issue of Science, show
that this imbalance of serotonin in the brain-
stem,  which  coordinates  many  fundamental
functions including control over cardiovascu-
lar  and  respiratory  systems,  is  sufficient  to
cause sudden death in the mice.
“At first the mice seemed normal. But then
they suffered sporadic and unpredictable drops
in heart rate and body temperature, with more
than half dying during a restricted period of
early  life,”  says  Cornelius.  This  strongly  sup-
ported  the  idea  that  a  congenital  serotonin
defect  could  play  a  critical  role  in  SIDS.  As
serotonin neurons in the brainstem communi-
cate with the spinal cord to innervate the heart
and organs involved in temperature regulation,
the mice with defective signalling couldn’t pro-
duce  heat  when  placed  into  a  cold  chamber.
This  inability  to  activate  fundamental  body
systems  under  certain  conditions  is  likely  to
explain why they succumbed to sudden death.
"We hope the mouse model will help identi-
fy  risk  factors  for  SIDS,  which  remains  the
leading cause of death during the first year of
life  in  developed  countries,”  says  Enrica
Audero,  who  carried  out  the  research  in
Cornelius’  lab.  “One  remaining  question  is
whether the animals die during sleep, like in
SIDS, and whether we can identify which mice
will die by looking at their heart rate or body
temperature before the crisis. 
“Ultimately, we hope it will give new ideas to
doctors about how to diagnose babies at risk of
SIDS.”
•Cornelius’  group  had
some  extra  help  over
the summer in the form
of  Kristyn  Maiorca,  a
sophomore  from  MIT
in Cambridge, USA.
Kristyn,  or  Kiki  to
her friends, got the chance to spend two
months  with  the  Gross  group  as  part  of
MIT’s  MISTI  programme,  which  helps
their students find internships around the
world.
Working  alongside  postdoc  Valeria
Carola,  Kiki  studied  mice  behavioural
analysis,  particularly  maternal  environ-
ments,  and  learned  several  new  tech-
niques. “I hadn’t worked with mice before,
and it’s really interesting to work in a big
lab. It’s a beautiful environment, too,” she
says. When she finishes at MIT, Kiki plans
to do a Masters degree and would like to
return to Europe to study or work. 
MISTI has representatives in Germany,

Malaria: chasing a ghost
EMBO sets out for the southern hemisphere 
South African scientists to access European research 
F
ormer  EMBL  Director  General  Fotis  C.
Kafatos  never  misses  an  opportunity  to
stop by in Heidelberg, and at the last EMBL
Science and Society Heidelberg Forum on 26
May, he spoke about the fight against malaria.
After  what  was  probably  the  best-attended
Heidelberg Forum event ever, he expanded on
some  of  the  still  open  questions  in  malaria
research.
Scientists have managed to eradicate world-
wide diseases like measles. Why is it so diffi-
cult to combat malaria?
Measles is caused by a virus with very few
proteins which can be used directly to develop
an  immune  response,  while  malaria  is  much
more  complex.  Its  agent  is  a  parasite  called
plasmodium, which has two life cycles: one in
the mosquito and another in the human. The
human  organism  is  practically  powerless
against  the  parasite.  This  is  an  exceptionally
malicious  intruder  that  hides  in  the  human
liver  first  and  then  gets  into  the  circulation,
where it destroys red blood cells one by one.
What makes the parasite so hard to capture?
It multiplies very fast. It’s very hard to spot
the  plasmodium  while  it’s  in  the  liver,  and
when it gets into the circulation it practically
explodes. Thousands of parasites evolve from a
single  one  within  a  very  short  time,  and  the
immune system isn’t very active in the liver, so
it can’t produce the antibodies fast enough. 
The most incredible part, though, is that the
parasite’s genome is programmed in such a way
that the proteins on its surface keep changing.
After  a  certain  period  it  shuts  down  certain
genes and turns on new ones. That continuous
changing of the parasite’s surface makes it very
difficult to the immune system to react – it’s
like chasing a ghost.
What is the focus of your research?
In my group at Imperial College London we
concentrate on the part of the cycle which takes
place in the vector – the Anopheles mosquito.
This is the most vulnerable phase for the para-
site because its population is at the minimum
here.  After  the  mosquito  infects  itself,  which
happens when it bites an ill human, its immune
system is perfectly capable of destroying a large
numbers of the parasites. We try to unravel the
mechanism the mosquito uses to defend itself
against the plasmodium. If we manage to elim-
inate the agent in the vector, we could succeed
in stopping the disease altogether. 
Some  of  the  funding  bodies  in  malaria
research  are  very  generous.  The  Bill  and
Melinda  Gates  Foundation,  for  instance,
spends  millions  of  dollars  to  support  labs
working on the development of medicines. 
Why is there no vaccine on the market yet?
Many research groups are working on it at a
full  blast.  For  instance,  Hermann  Bujard,
EMBO’s  Executive  Director,  is  pursuing  very
interesting  methods  in  developing  vaccines.
Also, some of the already existing medicines
are quite successful, although not sufficiently
strong to completely destroy the parasite. We
need to attack the parasite in both phases of its
development – the human body and the mos-
quito. Otherwise the plasmodium that survives
in  the  mosquito  can  reinitiate  the  infection.
Our enemy is extremely clever. 
Do you believe in a malaria-free world?
Absolutely.  Malaria  used  to  be  a  prevalent
disease in southern Europe and we managed to
eliminate  it  by  using  anti-insecticides  like
DDT. Many people do not realise that malaria
has been around for thousands of years; even
the ancient Greeks and Romans knew of it. The
optimal way to get rid of the disease is a com-
bination  of  nets,  medicines  and  vaccines,  as
well as new methods to stop the transmission
of the agent by the mosquito. For me, it’s only a
matter  of  time  before  malaria  is  history  in
Africa, South Asia and South America as well.

T
he Nobel Prize for Literature in 2003, the
first film Oscar ever in 2006 and the con-
tract  for  the  2010  FIFA  World  Cup  –  South
Africa’s  politics  and  culture  have  recently
enjoyed an unprecedented boom. The country
is  on  its  way  to  join  the  global  elite  as  it
becomes more and more visible on the interna-
tional stage. 
A  new  cooperation  agreement  with  the
European  Molecular  Biology  Conference
(EMBC)  –  the  intergovernmental  funding
body for EMBO – will give South African sci-
entists a boost and link its researchers with col-
leagues around the world. EMBO will set out
to discover this terra incognita– in scientific
terms, at least – and forge paths of exchange. 
The agreement, signed in June, gives South
African scientists access to some core EMBO
activities:  the  organization  will,  for  example,
annually sponsor one practical course or work-
shop  and  one  plenary  lecture,  to  be  held  in
South Africa. Up to three South African scien-
tists will have the opportunity to network with
young  European  group  leaders  at  EMBO
Young Investigator meetings, and researchers
from  South  Africa  may  apply  for  EMBO
Fellowships. “EMBO is delighted to welcome
South African scientists to join our networks
that  foster  collaboration  and  information
exchange,”  says  EMBO  Executive  Director
Hermann Bujard. 
So  from  now  on,  the  EMBO  community
should get used to some of the typical South
African phrases like Howzit?, meaning simply
“how are things going?”

ment  can  be  found  atwww.embo.org/

D
id  you  know  that  Viagra  was  originally
developed to treat angina, and that it was
a unexpected ‘side effect’ which led to its being
marketed very differently?
Many drugs have side effects – most much
less  desirable  than  that  of  Viagra  – but  now
researchers have discovered how to use these
to their advantage. Researchers in Peer Bork’s
group at EMBL Heidelberg have developed a
computational  method,  published  in Science
on 11 July, that looks at a drug’s side effects in
order to predict new uses for it. 
As similar drugs often share target proteins,
modes of action and unpleasant side effects, this
means that drugs evoking similar side effects are
likely to act on the same molecular targets. 
“Such  a  correlation  not  only  reveals  the
molecular basis of many side effects, but also
hints  at  new  uses  of  marketed  drugs  in  the
treatment of diseases they were not specifically
developed for,” says Peer. 
The new approach could prove particularly
useful for chemically dissimilar drugs used in
different  therapeutic  areas  that  nevertheless
have an overlapping but so far unknown pro-
tein target profile. Applying the method to 746
marketed drugs, the scientists found 261 dis-
similar drugs that, in addition to their known
action,  are  also  likely  to  bind  to  unexpected
molecular targets. 20 of these were then tested
and 13 showed binding to the targets that were
predicted by side effect similarity. On testing
nine of these drugs further in cellular assays,
all showed activity and thus a desired effect on
the  cell  through  their  interaction  with  the
newly  discovered  target  proteins.  The  brain
enhancer  Donepezil,  for  example,  proved  to
share  a  target  with  the  anti-depressant
Venlafaxine,  meaning  that  Donepezil  might
also be used to treat depression. 
The big advantage of existing drugs is that
they have already been tested and approved for
use in patients. “Our method means new drugs
could be checked routinely for hidden targets
and potential use in other areas,” says Peer.

It’s not all bad: Unpleasant side effects can be put to good use... 
... and new EBI database boosts access to drug data
EMBL’s  well-travelled  exhibition  stand  found
itself in Athens at the end of June for the 33rd
FEBS  Congress,  ‘Biochemistry  of  Cell
Regulation’. 
The  Federation  of  European  Biochemical
Sciences (FEBS) is one of the largest organisa-
tions in European life sciences and seeks to pro-
mote,  encourage  and  support  biochemistry,
molecular cell biology and molecular biophysics
in a variety of ways. The annual congress attracts
more  than  2,500  attendees  and  is  one  of  the
largest in Europe.
“90% of visitors to the stand were either PhD
students or postdocs, and we encouraged peo-
ple to apply to our new EIPOD programme,”
says  Lena  Raditsch.  “Everyone  had  heard  of
EMBL  already  and  some  had  very  detailed
questions about working conditions or certain
programmes.”
Together with EMBO, FEBS is also inviting
nominations  for  next  year’s  FEBS/EMBO
Women in Science Award, which aims to high-
light the major contributions made by women
to  life  sciences  research.  The  first  award  was
presented this year in Athens to Naama Barkai
of the Weizman Institute of Science in Rehovot,
Israel, who received €10,000 and gave a special
plenary  lecture.  For  more  details  see
www.febs.org.
Improved  prediction  of  drug  side  effects,
among other things, will be a potential result
of the recent transfer of a large-scale drug dis-
covery  database  from  Netherlands-based
company Galapagos NV to the EBI.
Enabled by a grant of £4.7m (€5.8m) from
the Wellcome Trust, the transfer of the data-
base,  which  contains  information  on  the
properties and activities of drugs and a large
set of drug-like small molecules, to the public
domain will allow researchers worldwide to
make free use of knowledge essential for drug
discovery.
The database will be incorporated into the
EBI’s collection of open-access data resources
for  biomedical research  and  will  be  main-
tained  by  a  team  led  by  new  group  leader
Christoph Steinbeck. 
The free access will have greatest impact on
researchers in academia and in small compa-
nies on limited budgets. “This speaks to the
importance  of  this  information  for  transla-
tional research that the Wellcome Trust has
chosen to support this with sufficient long-
term  funding,”  says  EBI  Director  Janet
Thornton.

GOing for gold
T
he  Gene  Ontology  Annotation  (GOA)
database  at  the  EBI  now  contains  more
than 30 million annotations to over 4 million
proteins – that’s an increase of 20 million more
annotations in less than two years.
GOA  (www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA)  connects  the
Gene  Ontology,  a  detailed  and  highly  struc-
tured  ‘dictionary’  of  biological  functions  and
cellular locations, with the gene products that
perform these activities. The data supplied by
GOA has proved useful to biologists working
on a diversity of species who employ genomic
or proteomic investigation strategies.
“The major contribution of annotations to
our  dataset  is  the  large-scale  assignment  of
GO terms to proteins by electronic methods,”
explains Rachael Huntley, Scientific Database
Curator  at  GOA.  “But  people  don’t  always
realise that there are human beings involved
in the process, and that a lot of time is spent
by  expert  curators  on  manual  curation  that
provides  high-quality,  detailed  annotations.”
GOA has recently added BHF-UCL, who spe-
cialise in curating cardiovascular-related pro-
teins, and Reactome, the biological pathway
database,  to  their  list  of  external  curator
groups.
GO annotations can now be viewed via the
browser www.ebi.ac.uk/quickgo,  which  has
just undergone a complete re-design and offers
users  greatly  improved  searching  capabilities.
“It  displays,  filters  and  downloads  subsets  of
annotations,  which  is  particularly  useful  for
biologists  who  have  difficulties  parsing  large
sets  of  data,”  explains  Rachael.  “For  a  small
database we have a huge base of users through-
out  the  world,  many  of  which  are  at  EMBL,
who find our annotations extremely useful.”

Get your groove back
If you sit at a computer or a bench all day,
you  may  find  you  benefit  from  EMBL
Heidelberg’s  weekly  Rückenschule  (back
school).  Taught  by  qualified  practitioner
Ivonne  Bergmann  (pictured),  the  classes
help you gently improve your posture and
flexibility. “I wouldn’t be able to touch my
toes without it,” says one satisfied customer.
The classes are subsidised by the Staff
Association,  so  membership  is  only  €15
for  two  months.  Newcomers  are  always
welcome at the classes, which take place
in  EMBO’s  conference  room  from  4.30-
5.30pm on Mondays.
•The SA would also subsidise classes at the
outstations if local teachers can be found.

awards&honours
Inigo Martincorena, a visiting student to Nick Luscombe’s group at the EBI who’ll become a PhD
student from October, has received a prestigious Fundación Caja Madrid scholarship in Spain.
Prizes are awarded each year to students from various fields who are enrolled in a postgraduate
programme abroad. Inigo received his certificate from Prince Felipe and Princess Letizia at a cer-
emony at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid in May.
Gene Expression group leader Asifa Akhtaris the 2008 winner of the ELSO Early Career Award,
which is awarded once a year to someone who has made a significant contribution during their
initial career as an independent scientist in Europe. Asifa will receive her award at the ELSO meet-
ing in Nice on 1 September, where she will also present her work in a plenary lecture. Previous
EMBL winners were Elisa Izaurralde (2000), Jan Ellenberg (2004) and Elena Conti (2005). 
Berthold Kochis the new head of Internal Audit and is based at
EMBL Heidelberg. He studied for a diploma in macroeconomics at
the Freie Universität Berlin and then worked in different functions
in auditing, control and finance in mechanical engineering firm KSB
AG in Frankenthal and in Rouen, France. Before coming to EMBL in
July 2008 he was head of Internal Audit and Risk Management at
Paul  Hartmann  AG,  a  medical  products  firm  in  Heidenheim,
Germany.  Berthold  lives  with  his  wife  and  three  children  in
Frankenthal and likes to play squash in his spare time.
Kids  from  the  Englisches  Institut
primary school in Heidelberg enjoyed an
afternoon  with  the  microscopes  at
EMBL thanks to their scientist parents.
On  17  July  the  eight  children,  aged
between 7 and 9, started their visit with
a walk through the woods, picking up
leaves and insects. They then brought
their booty to EMBL to examine it more
closely   under   the   dissecting
microscopes.  EMBL  parents  Steffi
Kandels-Lewis,  Rolf  Thermann,  Sally-
Anne Watson and Lena Reunis not only
took care of the children on the day but
also volunteered EMBL as a venue for
the school’s ‘Forschen und Experiment-
ieren’ science week in the first place.
Grant success for EIPOD programme
The Interdisciplinary Postdocs (EIPOD) pro-
gramme has been awarded an FP7 COFUND
grant of €3.6m over the next four years.
Starting  from  the  current  selection
round, for which the deadline is 31 August,
the  programme  will  be  able  to  take  on  a
grand total of 20 postdocs annually. 40% of
the total fellowship costs will be funded by
the new grant.
The EIPOD programme was launched in
2007 to support postdocs to work on shared
projects across different labs or units, pro-
moting  interdisciplinary  research  and  the
exchange  of  ideas  between  fields  that  are
usually separate. The first round of selec-
tion  was  a  resounding  success,  with  124
applicants. EIPOD postdocs may suggest a
project themselves or choose a predefined
project proposed by the participating group
leaders.
“Thanks  to  this  additional  support,  the
EIPOD initiative will become an even more
important aspect of scientific life at EMBL,”
says Detlev Arendt, EMBL’s academic mentor
for postdoctoral training.
