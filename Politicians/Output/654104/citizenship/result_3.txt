Great scientific talks and vibrant enthusiasm in Turin for ‘EMBL in Italy’! Over 200 participants attended the event organised in collaboration with University of Turin and Università degli Studi del Piemonte Orientale and focusing on the indispensable role of curiosity-driven life science research. “This is my favorite meeting of the year,” said Head of EMBL Rome Cornelius Gross. “I always come away thinking a little differently about science.” https://lnkd.in/dV9py9Aj #science #event #collaboration #curiosity

Our International PhD programme recruitment is still open! Find out more about the programme from one of our PhD students, Jacqueline Toussaint. She uses bioinformatics to study pathogenic bacteria, focusing on correlating genotype and phenotype. Here you can read more about why Jacqueline decided to pursue the EMBL PhD programme, what new skills she has gained already, and where her fascination with bacteria stems from: https://lnkd.in/ewRjPP_b European Bioinformatics Institute | EMBL-EBI #PhD #recruitment #research #PhDlife #academia #careers

Sponges lack muscles and neurons. Yet, they are able to make coordinated movements. EMBL Heidelberg’s Arendt Group, in collaboration with the Savitski Team, Prevedel Group, and others, have revealed the molecular and evolutionary basis of sponge movement. Using advanced molecular techniques, they discovered that sponge’s movement relies on a system of water canals in their body, which are controlled by an ancient ‘relaxant-inflammatory’ molecular response. Notably, the very same response also regulates the tone of blood vessels in vertebrates. This work shows that, in contrast to earlier assumptions, sponge movement is driven by relaxation rather contraction, and highlights its evolutionary link to the vertebrate vascular system. The study has been conducted in collaboration with scientists from the University of Heidelberg, and Yale University. Fabian Ruperti https://lnkd.in/dnwW-e8G
