Editorial
Currently adorning the walls of the EMBL Advanced 
Training Centre is a striking lenticular print of a starfish 
nucleus, just about to divide. Recently, I stood staring 
at this picture in awe: it felt almost possible to dive 
deep into the mysterious centre of the nucleus. It is an 
astonishing work of art. But 3D visualisation technology 
– including 3D printing, virtual reality and computer 
games – is also helping EMBL researchers to better 
understand life under the microscope. We explore such 
innovative techniques in this edition which is themed 
on Dimensions (page 20). We also cover a range of other 
stories that illustrate the many dimensions of work and 
life at EMBL. We found structural biologists working 
in collaboration to develop the fourth dimension of 
time-resolved crystallography (page 11). We met EMBL 
service teams providing a bedrock for the study of the 
multifaceted universe of microbes (page 24). And we 
caught up with alumni volunteers who are helping to 
further the multidimensional impact of EMBL on the 
life-science community worldwide (page 44).

Stool transplants 
better understood
New study expands potential 
applications for stool transplants 
while emphasising need for 
personalised treatment
BY SONIA FURTADO NEVES 
For the first time, scientists studying 
stool transplants can track which 
strains of bacteria from a donor 
take hold in a patient’s gut after a 
transplant. A team led by EMBL, 
with collaborators at Wageningen 
University, the Academic Medical 
Centre in the Netherlands and the 
University of Helsinki, Finland, found 
that patient-donor compatibility 
likely plays a bigger role in these 
transplants than previously thought. 
The study was published in Science.
“Ultimately, the goal is to move from 
a stool transplant to something more 
manageable, such as a pill,” says 
Simone Li, a PhD student in the Bork 
lab at EMBL. “Our work shows that 
this is likely going to be a personalised 
bacterial cocktail, rather than a one-
size-fits-all solution.”
Stool transplants involve taking 
microbes from the poo of a healthy 
donor and transferring them to a 
patient’s gut. This procedure can 
help restore health to patients 
suffering from conditions that skew 
the balance of gut microbiota. The 
approach has been successful for 
treating recurrent Clostridium 
difficile (C. diff ) infections, which 
can cause life-threatening cases of 
diarrhoea. 
But for other gastrointestinal 
conditions, like ulcerative colitis, 
stool transplants have proven much 
less effective. The current study, led 
by Peer Bork and Shinichi Sunagawa 
at EMBL, could help improve those 
odds. The trick, they said, is to not 
only distinguish between species of 
gut microbes in a patient, but also to 
identify the strains of each species.
Most people have Escherichia coli (E. 
coli) in their gut, but different strains 
of this species, some of which can 
cause health issues. By distinguishing 
between different strains, the team 
could ascertain whether the microbes 
in a patient’s gut were their own or 
came from the donor.
They found that new strains of 
microbes from the donor were more 
likely to colonise a patient’s gut if the 
patient already had that species. This 
implies that if doctors can match 
donors to patients, the chances of a 
successful treatment could improve 
considerably. 
 “With this method, we can really see 
if, for example, an antibiotic-resistant 
strain is replaced by a non-resistant 
one,” says microbiologist Willem de 
Vos, who led the work at Wageningen 
University and the University of 
Helsinki, “so it could help to design 
stool transplants to work in other 
conditions beyond C. diff.”

New professional association 
for core facilities in life 
sciences founded at EMBL
BY ISABELLE KLING
Access to complex and ever-
evolving technologies is essential 
for biomedical researchers, but can 
be difficult for smaller laboratories 
to set up and manage. To ensure 
that scientists get access to the 
best equipment, therefore, many 
universities and life science research 
institutions now have specialised 
core facilities and infrastructures 
operated by dedicated staff, experts 
in those technologies. EMBL, for 
example, has core facilities covering 
a wide range of technologies used in 
molecular biology, including imaging 
technologies, genetic engineering, 
and database management.
each other,” explains Rainer 
Pepperkok, who is Head of Core 
Facilities at EMBL .
The founding board was elected 
during the CTLS 2016 Conference 
at EMBL in June 2016, and 
the statutes were voted on and 
accepted. The goals of this new 
pan-European association are to 
offer a forum for the professionals 
in core facilities to meet and 
share information, as well as 
to help members with training. 
The association will organise 
regular conferences, workshops 
and networking events; it will 
also produce a database of all the 
existing core facilities available in 
Europe, as well as provide advice 
and support institutions that want 
to set up their own facilities.

Enzymes, sorted
A new method of searching for 
enzymes by function makes it 
easier to find the best match
BY MARY TODD BERGMAN
How would you find an enzyme that 
likes both cold water and digesting the 
dirt left on clothes? For biotechnology 
researchers, the first step would be 
to search the public data archives, 
which offer an overwhelming amount 
of information about enzymes. A new 
approach developed at EMBL-EBI 
makes it easier to find the best match 
by enabling search by function, rather 
than by gene sequence. 
The functions of enzymes are 
the subject of intense interest in 
biotechnology. There is so much 
information available that it can 
be difficult to find what you need – 
particularly in the case of isomerases, 
whose substrates share the same 
atomic composition but are arranged 
differently in 3D space.
New approach 
“Normally when scientists research 
enzymes they look at the sequence 
first – a gene sequence translates to 
an enzyme, which has a particular 
3D shape and does certain jobs, or 
functions,” explains Sergio Martínez 
Cuesta, formerly at EMBL-EBI and 
now at the Cancer Research UK 
– Cambridge Institute. “But what 
they’re usually looking to find out is, 
how similar is the function of this 
enzyme to the chemical activity I’m 
looking for?”
Sorting by function is tricky, as 
enzyme families can catalyse multiple 
reactions, some very different from 
one another. Enzymes, and in fact all 
proteins, can be grouped according 
to their sequence, which implies 
function. But closely related members 
of an enzyme family pose a problem: 
their sequence may be similar, but 
their functions may differ.  
The Thornton group resolved this 
problem by creating a new approach 
that puts function first, and applying 
it to a comprehensive study of 
isomerases.
“Our work gives researchers a way 
to see, for example, how broad a 
range of reactions an enzyme might 
be involved in – and that is very

important to know if you only want 
that enzyme to do one thing, like 
digest dirt but not cotton,” explains 
Martínez. “It’s a method that lets 
you pinpoint how specific – or 
promiscuous – the function of an 
enzyme might be as its chemistry 
evolves.”
Interdisciplinary
The group compared 250 isomerases 
reactions in enzymes from different 
classes, one at a time, to find 
similarities, then verified their 
findings using the EC-BLAST search 
tool. They showed how different 
isomerases can evolve to become 
enzymes with different functions – 
establishing a new way to describe 
functions while highlighting 
otherwise elusive relationships.
“Our method captures current 
knowledge, characterises the 
chemistry and catalytic function of 
isomerisation, and makes it easier to 
annotate their DNA sequences,” 
says Janet Thornton, Senior 
Scientist at EMBL-EBI. “This 
is the first time that people can 
search enzyme classes to find 
proteins with similar function, 
drawing on a reliable knowledge 
ba se.”
“The interdisciplinarity of 
this project is what makes it so 
special,” she adds. “In the end 
we have something that allows 
us to explore the diversity of the 
chemistry of life more easily.”

associated with breast cancer and 
13 new mutational signatures that 
influence tumour development.  The 
group analysed 560 breast cancer 
genomes from cancer patients from 
the US, Europe and Asia, hunting for 
mutations that encourage cancers 
to grow and trying to recognise 
mutational signatures in each 
patient’s tumour.
Unexpected technique
“We know that genetic changes and 
their position in the cancer genome 
influence how a person responds 
to a cancer therapy,” explains 
Ewan Birney of EMBL-EBI, whose 
group used new computational 
techniques to analyse the sequence 
of genetic information held in each 
of the sample genomes. “This study 
uncovered some new reasons why 
breast cancer arises. It also gave us 
an unexpected way to characterise 
the types of mutations that happen 
in certain breast cancers.”
The group found that women who 
carry mutations in the BRCA1 or 
BRCA2 gene, and therefore have 
increased risk of developing breast 
and ovarian cancer, had whole-
cancer genome profiles that were 
very different to other breast cancers 
and highly distinctive from one 
other.
Towards personalisation 
“In the future, we’d like to be able to 
profile individual cancer genomes so 
that we can identify the treatment 
most likely to be successful for a

“If a cell line has the same genetic 
features as a patient’s tumour, and 
that cell line responded to a specific 
drug, we can focus new research on 
this finding. This could ultimately 
help assign cancer patients into more 
precise groups based on how likely 
they are to respond to therapy,” says 
Francesco Iorio, first author and a 
postdoc at EMBL-EBI and the Sanger 
Institute. “This resource can be used 
to create tools for doctors to select a 
clinical trial that is most promising 
for their cancer patient, even though 
it is still a way off.”
“We could assess the value of 
different molecular data types 
for predicting drug efficacy, as a 
first step towards understanding 
which molecular characterisations 
clinicians should prioritise,” says co-
senior author Julio Saez-Rodriguez of 
EMBL-EBI and RWTH Aachen. “We 
hope others will use these datasets 
for different purposes, and so we have 
made them publicly available along 
with the tools needed to mine them.”

EMBL researchers played a

Every cancer is different, and a 
major challenge in cancer research 
is predicting how a patient’s tumour 
is likely to respond to a given drug. 
Now, thanks to a new study published 
in Cell, scientists know they can gain 
meaningful insights from cancer 
cells grown in the laboratory, as they 
harbour most of the same genetic 
changes found in patients’ tumours. 
The team looked at genetic mutations 
known to cause cancer in more than 
11 000 patient samples of 29 different 
tumour types and mapped these 
alterations onto 1000 cancer cell 
lines. Next, they tested the cell lines 
for sensitivity to 265 different cancer 
drugs to understand which of these 
changes effect sensitivity.
They made two significant 
discoveries. First, the most frequent 
molecular abnormalities found in 
patient’s cancers are also found 
in cancer cells in the laboratory. 
Second, they found that many of the 
molecular abnormalities detected in 
the patients can determine whether 
a particular drug affects a cancer 
cell’s survival.

How cells bag their rubbish
A new study – the first genome-scale 
experiment of its kind – provides 
a novel way to understand early 
development. Gastrulation is the 
point when an animal’s body plan 
is set, just before organs start 
to develop. One of the biggest 
challenges in studying gastrulation 
is the very small number of cells that 
make up an embryo at this stage.
“How do you turn from an egg into 
an animal, with all sorts of tissues? 
Many of the things that go wrong, 
like birth defects, are caused by 
problems in early development,” 
says Bertie Göttgens, Research 
Anatomy of 
a decision 
Group Leader at the Wellcome 
Trust–MRC Cambridge Stem Cell 
Institute (CSCI).
Thanks to advances in single-cell 
sequencing, research led by EMBL-
EBI and the CSCI were able to 
analyse over 1000 individual cells 
of gastrulating mouse embryos. The 
result is an atlas of gene expression 
during very early, healthy 
mammalian development.
“Single-cell technologies allow us 
to make direct observations, to see 
what’s going on during the earliest 
stages of development,” says 
John Marioni of EMBL-EBI, the 
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute 
and the University of Cambridge. 
“We can look at individual cells 
and see the whole set of genes that 
are active at different stages of 
development, which until now have 
been very difficult to access.”
Researchers at EMBL and the 
University of Cambridge ask: 
“How does a mouse embryo first 
begin to transform from a ball 
of unfocussed cells into a small, 
structured entity? ”
BY MARY TODD BERGMAN
IMAGE: EMBL/SPENCER PHILLIPS
IMAGE: STRITTMATTER LABORATORY, YALE UNIVERSITY (CC BY)
Armed with that information, 
researchers can map cells from 
embryos in which some genetic 
factors are not working properly to 
healthy ones at the corresponding 
developmental stage in the atlas. 
Next, the team studied what 
happened when they removed a 
genetic factor essential for the 
formation of blood cells from a mouse 
embryo. They were surprised by 
what they found: cells that would 
normally commit to becoming blood 
cells in healthy embryos became 
confused, effectively getting ‘stuck’. 
“What’s really exciting is that we can 
now look at the very small number 
of cells that are actually making the 
decision at the precise time point 
when the decision is being made,” 
says Marioni. 
“We can look at things that we know 
are important but were never able to 
see before – perhaps like people felt 
when they got hold of a microscope 
for the first time, suddenly seeing 
worlds they’d never thought of,” adds 
Göttgens. “This is just the beginning 
of how single-cell genomics will 
transform our understanding of early 
development.”

The build-up of protein deposits  
in cells is a hallmark of 
neurodegenerative diseases such 
as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. “A 
protein accumulates in neurons, 
neurons die, and patients gradually 
lose brain functions,” says Carsten 
Sachse from EMBL. “If the process 
by which the cell removes those 
proteins can be enhanced, then you 
might be able to prevent that disease 
progression.” Before scientists can 
give the cell’s rubbish collectors a 
boost, they must understand how the 
system works. In a paper recently 
published in EMBO Reports, Sachse 
and his lab drew on expertise from 
colleagues throughout EMBL to do 
just that.

“Now we have the right people, in the right place, with 
the right technology!” exclaims EMBL group leader 
Thomas Schneider, who coordinates activities at the 
EMBL crystallography beamlines on DESY’s light source 
PETR A III in Hamburg. Together with Arwen Pearson, 
Professor at the Centre for Ultrafast Imaging (CUI), 
Universität Hamburg, he and his team have been laying 
the groundwork to take crystallography – his structural 
biology method of choice – into a new time dimension.
Crystallography uses powerful X-ray beams to probe 
the 3D atomic structure of biological molecules such 
as proteins. As the X-rays bounce off the atoms in the 
protein, a distinctive pattern is produced that reveals 
information about its structure. This information can

help scientists understand not only what a protein looks 
like, but also how it works and interacts with other 
molecules. “Crystallography gives us a single snapshot of 
a molecule in a single state,” explains Pearson. “If you’re 
lucky, your data will also allow you to see how it is bound 
to another molecule and you can begin to extrapolate 
how that molecule works.” But sometimes one structure 
alone is not enough.
The whole of the protein can be involved in a binding 
event and any subsequent chemical reaction, and it 
changes shape as the molecules lock into place. “But just 
how the entire structure moves and changes shape is not 
really understood,” says Pearson. “What we really want 
to do is to watch this process in motion.” Instead of just

one snapshot, time-resolved crystallography involves 
taking many snapshots in quick succession to create a 
film of the molecule in motion, similar to running many 
photos together to make a movie. 
Pump and probe
Time-resolved crystallography is still very much a niche 
method, with complex requirements for both sample 
preparation and experimental set-up. Even defining 
when everything starts – Time Zero – is tricky. The 
reaction has to be triggered by a “pump” – a light pulse 
or a temperature jump for instance. “Just imagine me 
giving you a push,” says Pearson. “The push, or pump, 
triggers you to start falling over, and we can watch what 
happens when you do. That push defines Time Zero.” 
As the protein starts to move, the X-ray beam is used to 
probe the 3D structure of the protein at regular intervals 
thereafter, capturing information about the structure at 
different stages of the process. 
This “pump-probe” concept won Ronald George 
Wreyford Norrish, George Porter and Manfred Eigen 
a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967 and is widely used 
in time-resolved experiments. Some naturally light-
sensitive proteins, like those involved in vision, can be 
easily triggered using bright laser pulses. Otherwise, 
a ‘reaction initiation strategy’ must be painstakingly 
worked out for each new protein. Once this has been 
established, the crystallographic experiment itself 
requires a very bright X-ray source and clever strategies 
to ensure data of sufficient quality are obtained. These 
issues are the current focus of Pearson’s research at the 
CUI and will be central themes for the new Hamburg 
Advanced Research Centre for Bioorganic Chemistry 
(HARBOR), which is being coordinated by Pearson and 
is soon to be established at the Universität Hamburg.
New dimensions
The beamlines at EMBL Hamburg at DESY’s light source 
PETR A III have precisely the right qualities for taking 
crystallography into this next time dimension. “In 
order to take many snapshots in quick succession, you 
need a really small, stable and brilliant beam,” explains 
Schneider. “Here we really profit from the excellent 
properties of PETR A III, and the EMBL crystallography 
beamline P14 that translates the beam delivered 
by PETR A III into what we need for these types of 
experiments.” 
To catch a process in action, you also need to be able to 
work on the same timescale at which the reaction occurs. 
“With the new European X-ray Free Electron Laser 
being built here in Hamburg, we will be able to observe 
extremely fast chemical reactions,” explains Pearson. 
“But we are also interested in watching mechanistic 
structural changes – these occur on timescales that are 
already accessible to us at the beamlines. Currently, we 
can see reactions that occur in the millisecond range, but 
plans are afoot to further optimise the beamline so we can 
start to look at fascinating events happening on nano- and 
microsecond timescales.” With grant funding from the 
German Federal Ministry for Education and Research, 
the groups will be able to extend the EMBL beamline P14 
to establish an additional endstation dedicated to time-
resolved crystallography. 
Coming together
It was a talk by Pearson at the European Crystallography 
Meeting held in Warwick, UK in 2013 that got Schneider 
thinking and made him realise that time-resolved 
experiments might actually be possible on the EMBL 
crystallography beamlines at PETR A III. Discussions 
then really kicked off a year later when Pearson took up 
her post as Professor at the CUI, just across the road from 
the EMBL beamlines on the DESY campus. “The facilities 
at PETR A III were the reason I came to Hamburg!” says 
Pearson with a smile. “Hamburg is currently the epicentre 
of time-resolved science, and is the place to do these types 
of experiments,” she adds excitedly. 
But the ongoing development and establishment of the 
technique in Hamburg wouldn’t be possible without 
the dedication of many people behind the scenes, say 
Schneider and Pearson – from the EMBL beamline 
Project Evaluation Committee who recognised the unique 
opportunity, to the instrumentation teams based in both 
Hamburg and Grenoble who provide dedicated support 
to the project. “Time-resolved crystallography is by no 
means standard, and it is crucial to have the support 
and expertise of people like Gleb Bourenkov, a principle 
beamline scientist at P14 who has tested different set-ups 
on the beamline.” 
Pearson and Schneider are already working with several 
groups who are interested in studying the dynamics of 
their samples – but this is just the start. “We will be able 
to help scientists choose the right initiation switch for 
their system in preparation for experiments at the EMBL 
beamlines and ultimately the dedicated endstation,” 
Pearson explains. “We want to provide the best beamline 
facilities and services so that scientists can study the 
dynamics of their proteins in detail,” adds Schneider, 
grinning. “We are the gadget guys!”

Crystal microjet
Time-resolved crystallography allows scientists to 
study how a protein’s shape changes during a 
reaction. Scientists use a laser to trigger the 
reaction, and then an X-ray beam to capture a 
series of snapshots of the protein as the 
reaction unfolds. They can then put those 
snapshots together to create a movie 
of the molecule in action.
Protein crystal
A protein crystal consists of regularly arranged 
protein molecules. It also contains a lot of 
solvent, which gives the molecules space for a 
small amount of movement and changing 
shape.

How EMBL scientists and mechanics are 
working together with ESRF colleagues on an 
upgrade for one of Europe’s big X-ray sources
BY ROSEMARY WILSON
Just as doctors use X-rays to study 
the hairline fracture of a bone in the 
hospital, scientists also use X-rays to 
explore structures that are invisible 
to the naked eye. But whereas the 
hospital’s X-ray machine can only 
reveal details of the skeleton beneath 
our skin, the scientists’ X-rays 
– which are produced by stadium-
sized circular machines called 
synchrotrons – are able to delve far 
deeper and reveal minute details of 
the atomic world. They are enabling 
unprecedented insights into such 
worlds as the surface inaccuracies 
of metal, to the delicate fossils 
trapped in rocks, to the paintings 
hidden by their creator under famous 
masterpieces, to the molecular 
structures of proteins.  
The European Synchrotron Radiation 
Facility (ESRF), situated at the foot 
of the French Alps on the European 
Photon and Neutron (EPN) campus in 
Grenoble, has been producing X-rays 
for scientific research for more than 
20 years. EMBL’s Grenoble site also 
forms part of the campus. Scientists 
there use this synchrotron radiation 
to explore the 3D atomic structure of 
biological molecules such as proteins 
and nucleic acids, shedding light on 
how we might prevent them causing 
disease or harness their unique 
qualities for new biotechnologies. As 
part of a collaboration that has been 
ongoing for over two decades, EMBL 
scientists work alongside ESRF 
colleagues to design and operate 
measuring stations – or beamlines 
– for structural biology experiments 
on the 844m synchrotron ring. 
Now, in an extensive modernisation 
programme structural biologists will 
be able to develop techniques such as 
time-resolved crystallography and 
serial crystallography to explore, in 
unprecedented detail, the molecules 
that make up our world. 
An air of excitement
“There is definitely an air of 
excitement here at the moment,” 
says Gordon Leonard, the Head of 
the Structural Biology Group at the 
ESRF. EMBL group leader Andrew 
McCarthy, who works closely with 
Leonard as part of the ESRF-EMBL 
Joint Structural Biology Group 
(JSBG) to improve the accuracy 
and speed of structural biology 
experiments, agrees. “Our users 
will be able to use the traditional 
crystallography set-ups they are used 
to, as well as being able to choose 
from a wider range of techniques 
such as serial and time-resolved 
crystallography and even being able 
to take high-resolution images of 
individual proteins inside the cell.” 
To study the structure of a protein 
using X-ray crystallography, 
scientists first need their protein 
samples to take on a crystalline 
form – much like the salt crystals 
produced from salt water. When 
put into the X-ray beam, the X-rays 
diffract off the atoms in the protein 
crystal, producing a distinct pattern 
that can be used to understand the 
molecular structure of the protein. 
But as scientists seek to explore the 
structure of larger and more complex 
proteins – and even multiple protein 
molecules bound together – the 
crystals that these samples produce

are, conversely, smaller and more 
fragile. 
Traditionally, scientists remove 
protein crystals from the plates in 
which they grow before taking them 
to the beamlines. Many proteins, 
such as some membrane proteins, 
cannot be encouraged into forming 
large crystals but will often form very 
tiny crystals. Until recently these 
very fragile crystals were almost 
impossible to extract from where 
they were grown. To get around this 
problem, EMBL team leaders Florent 
Cipriani and Jose Marquez developed 
CrystalDirect™. “This technology 
allows you to automatically mount 
individual or multiple crystals 
from plates and subsequently 
move them directly into the X-ray 
beam for measurements,” explains 
McCarthy. “We will implement this 
technology on the beamline for serial 
crystallography techniques, which 
will be a great help to our users.”
Extreme brilliance
To be able to measure these tiny 
crystals, a smaller and more focused 
X-ray beam is also needed. “With 
bigger, less compact beams, most of 
the X-rays will pass by such a small 
crystal without touching it – that is a 
lot of lost energy,” explains Leonard. 
“And the longer the crystal is exposed, 
the higher the risk of damage.” 
The 150 million euro ESRF Extremely 
Brilliant Source (ESRF-EBS) project 
aims to address this problem. “We 
will produce X-ray beams up to 100 
times more brilliant and focused than 
is currently possible,” says Leonard 
enthusiastically. “That’s like the 
difference between trying to read a 
book by the light of a candle in the 
next room and holding a powerful 
head torch directly over the page.”  
This ambitious project entails 
replacing the current synchrotron 
storage ring with an upgraded 
version within the existing ESRF 
infrastructure, all the while 
recycling as many components as 
possible. “The old infrastructure 
will be re-used – this keeps costs 
and construction time to a minimum 
and allows us to keep the existing 
experimental stations fed by the 
storage ring,” explains Leonard.
Key to the new design are 1000 
custom made, high-performance 
magnets. They will be slotted 
precisely together in a lattice 
designed to reduce energy loss, while 
guiding electrons around the ring 
of these is ID23-2, the world’s first 
microfocus beamline dedicated to 
macromolecular crystallography. 
“It has contributed nearly 900 
depositions in the Protein Data Bank 
(PDB), including several relating 
to the structures of medically 
important membrane proteins, 
but it is now over 10 years old,” 
McCarthy explains. “The optical 
configurations will get a major 
overhaul in order to provide an 
extremely high intensity beam 
with a micron-sized diameter. This 
also requires new high-precision 
instruments designed by Cipriani 
and his team for measurements, as 
well as new algorithms for analysing 
the data.” 
A bright future
Meanwhile, the JSBG are planning 
even further into the future. “With 
such an intense beam, it will 
be possible to do time-resolved 
experiments,” says McCarthy. 
“More information will be captured 
in shorter time frames: we can 
start to ‘watch’ protein structural 
changes in real time by capturing 
multiple snapshots and putting them 
together to form a movie, opening 
our eyes even wider to an incredible 
molecular universe,” he explains. 
“The future is very bright!”

Structural biology at EMBL covers 
the full cycle of discovery: curiosity, 
training, research, instrumentation, 
experimentation, analysis, quality 
control, data deposition, data 
sharing and re-use, molecular 
design and back again
BY ROSEMARY WILSON
T
he Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe), in 
operation at EMBL-EBI for 20 years, is an 
essential resource for depositing, analysing 
and accessing new data. The PDBe team 
handles European and African depositions 
to the PDB and the Electron Microscopy Data Bank 
(EMDB) archives and works hard to provide an accurate, 
useful and flexible resource that keeps pace with a fast-
growing field. 
A new angle
“When the PDB was first established, it contained only 
data from X-ray crystallography experiments,” says 
Gerard Kleywegt, team leader of PDBe at EMBL-EBI. 
“Over the past few decades, we have seen increasing 
amounts of data produced by new methods such as 
NMR, electron microscopy and solution scattering. This 
diversity is great for structural biologists, but we are not 
always able to handle diverse data types. Collaboration, 
dialogue and close ties with groups focused on different 
methods are absolutely essential to providing the best 
possible service to the entire community.” 
A case in point is small-angle scattering (SAS) data. 
In the past, SAS-based models were occasionally 
deposited in the PDB alongside X-ray crystallography 
data, but as SAS techniques improved and increased 
in popularity, the wwPDB partners recognised a need 
for new expertise to manage these data. A wwPDB 
task force was established and in 2014, the Small-Angle 
Scattering Biological Data Bank (SASBDB) was launched 
by Dmitri Svergun’s group at EMBL Hamburg. From its 
inception, the SASBDB and PDBe teams have worked 
closely together, transferring knowledge and data between 
Hinxton and Hamburg. 
“The PDBe team are very open,” says Alexey Kikhney, 
Senior Technical Officer in the Svergun group. “Their 
expertise has been invaluable – they have been able to 
advise us on problems and issues we might run into 
in terms of infrastructure, policies, standards and 
programming.” 
The Hinxton and Hamburg teams have several joint 
projects. “We are working on creating an interface that 
makes it easier for users to move between the SASBDB  
and the PDB,” says Kikhney. 
Another technique on the rise is cryo-electron microscopy 
(cryo-EM). By firing beams of electrons at frozen samples, 
scientists obtain images that they can piece together to 
create atomic models and 3D representations, or ‘volume 
maps’, of the molecules in the sample. In 2002, the EMDB 
was established at EMBL-EBI as an archive for these 
volume maps. But it was not designed to handle the raw 
data. 
“The raw data are crucial for scientists who want to 
understand and validate the structures, or develop new 
software tools for handling cryo-EM data,” explains 
Ardan Patwardhan, who heads the EMDB at EMBL-EBI. 
In 2014, the Electron Microscopy Pilot Image Archive 
(EMPIAR) was established by the PDBe to fill this gap. 
“Developing EMPIAR was very challenging in terms 
of storing and transferring huge amounts of data,” says 
Patwardhan. “The largest entry is over 12 Terabytes, 
which would require thousands of DVDs if you were trying 
to store it yourself. The EM field is developing rapidly. We 
are working on tools for users to visualise 3D structures 
right from the atomic to the cellular level, opening up new 
avenues for knowledge dissemination and discovery.”
 18EMBLetc.  SUMMER 2016

Digging deep
Thanks to these efforts behind the scenes, scientists now 
have a wealth of data at their fingertips. 
“I look for common patterns in biology, and for that the 
PDBe is a very important resource,” says Alejandro 
Panjkovich, an EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoc (EIPOD) 
supervised jointly by Svergun in Hamburg and Kleywegt 
at EMBL-EBI. “When we develop new computational 
approaches, we need to know if they will work on existing 
structures. The PDB represents a huge source of data we 
can search for reoccurring patterns, test new methods on, 
collect statistics and use as benchmarks.”
“The PDB is really essential to the work we do,” adds 
Joana Pereira, a PhD student in Victor Lamzin’s 
group at EMBL Hamburg that develops methods for 
determining the quality of information about how small 
molecules interact with proteins. “The PDB is a very well 
maintained archive, but even the ‘bad’ entries are useful 
for us. We can test our methods to improve these entries 
and find new methods for validating them.”
Bringing it together
Structural biology at EMBL covers the full spectrum of 
discovery: curiosity, training, research, analysis, quality 
control, data deposition, data sharing and molecule 
design. As part of research infrastructure networks 
such as ELIXIR, EMBL’s services are well placed to 
grow, continuing to enable research and discovery 
as technologies change. Through ELIXIR, the PDBe 
team recently teamed up with scientists in the Czech 
Republic to train researchers from Masaryk University in 
enriching structure data with value added information. 
If successful, the project will broaden the European base 
for structure annotation and bolster data expertise in the 
Czech Republic’s life-science community. 
“The PDB plays a crucial role in structural biology 
research and development,” says Sameer Velankar, who 
leads PDBe content and integration at EMBL-EBI. “What 
started as a central repository for predominantly X-ray 
crystallography structures has evolved and diversified 
through constant dialogue with the community it serves. 
We are very much looking forward to another 20 years of 
helping scientists bring ‘structure to biology’.”

When it comes to lenticular posters, 
shifting your perspective is as simple 
as moving your head: What you see 
standing at one end of the poster 
may not be the same at the other 
end. But for several labs at EMBL, 
converting microscopic data into 
a 3D poster allows biologists to see 
what they never knew about before 
– from where proteins interact with 
a folding tissue, to how a Drosophila 
embryo develops. “We almost never 
see just a sharp surface,” EMBL 
scientist Stefan Günther points out. 
“We see reflections, we see shadings, 
we see noise.” For these reasons, 
visualising data in 3D can paint a 
more striking picture of the science. 
“When you go back and forth on 
the computer screen and rotate a 
structure in 2D, you have to have the 
first structure in your head,” EMBL 
scientist Gustavo de Medeiros says. 
“But on a lenticular poster, if you just 
move your head to a different angle 
instead, the data is much clearer.” 
Life in Perspective, an exhibit to be 
showcased at the Heidelberg City 
Library in October and November 
2016, will explore this medium by 
bringing small structures to larger 
scales. “The nucleus of the cell looks 
like a mountain, which is familiar 
to us,” Günther says. “That is one of 
the things scientists and society as a 
whole can benefit from – by showing 
real data as it is.”

Games are a powerful teaching 
tool, and scientists have turned 
to video games to gather data and 
crowdsource solutions to biological 
questions. But it turns out gaming 
can also be a way for scientists to 
improve their skills. 
Omar Wagih, a PhD student in the 
Beltrão group at EMBL-EBI, created 
a game called Guess the Correlation, 
which challenges players to do 
something that scientists often must 
do: look at a graph showing dots 
plotted on two axes, and estimate 
how tightly linked – how correlated 
– the variables represented by 
those two axes are. Even seasoned 
scientists can get caught out, he says. 
“Sometimes people are so confident 
in their answer that they believe that 
the chart is wrong,” he says. “I’ve had 
people emailing me saying ‘there’s 
no way this is right, something’s 
wrong with your game,’ and I’ll send 
them the data so they can check for 
themselves, because the game was 
right.” Besides alerting colleagues 
to how poorly human intuition can 
do at this task – and collecting data 
he hopes will help to reveal what 
kinds of graph people are most likely 
to guess wrong – Wagih says he has 
anecdotal evidence that players 
improve after playing repeatedly, 
implying this could be a way for 
scientists to hone an important 
skill. “I’m so much better at it now,” 
he says. “When I play it alongside 
friends, they’ll say ‘that’s a .6,’ or 
something, and I’ll say ‘no, it looks 
more like a .43’ – and my guess will 
be closer.”

The idea of putting on a headset 
and stepping into your data may 
sound like science fiction, but some 
scientists say virtual reality could 
help us understand data better. 
EMBL group leader Theodore 
Alexandrov wishes he’d had access 
to the technology a few years 
ago, when he was working with 
collaborators studying the different 
molecules on the surface of lichens. 
“Lichens are such curly and intricate 
structures with parts sticking out 
at all possible angles, that it’s really 
difficult to recognise its shape on a 
photo or a 2D map. Does this part 
face sunlight or shade? Are these 
two parts touching each other?” 
he says. Even with something as 
familiar as the human body, seeing 
things in 3D can make it more 
intuitive to generate hypotheses, 
Alexandrov argues: “It was way 
easier to understand data looking 
at even a simple 3D visualisation 
than when you’re looking at a 
spreadsheet!” Virtual reality could 
also help biologists engage with 
colleagues from other disciplines, 
says Alexandrov: “A black and white 
image might mean a lot to experts, 
but for computer scientists it’s like 
something from the stone age. If you 
can show them something in VR, 
that’ll grab their attention!” Ivan

Hold it in your hand
As 3D printing technology becomes more 
mainstream, it is making its way into the lab, 
too. “At first I wanted to have 3D printed things 
for how cool this technology is,” Hernando 
Martinez Vergara, a PhD student in the Arendt 
group at EMBL, admits. “But I was highly 
surprised to see that having a volume in your 
hand is way more telling than having it on a 
screen. I have spent dozens of hours looking at 
Platynereis’ body plan on screens, but just a few 
seconds of playing around with a 3D printed 
model revealed so many details I could not 
believe it!”
Christoph Müller, Joint Head of the Structural 
and Computational Biology Unit, says the same 
is true of his work in structural biology. “It 
really gives you a different perspective – you 
can literally ‘get to grips’ with things,” he says. 
“I sometimes take the model of a molecule and 
try to see where the active site would be, where 
things fit.” 
the lab’s own research, is aware that 
to become truly useful for scientific 
research, the technology will have 
to become more practical. “It would 
need plug-ins for programmes that 
scientists already use, and it would 
have to become simple enough 
to just put on the headset, look 
at something, then put down the 
headset and carry on working,” he 
says. “But with new technologies like 
this, you never know what you can 
do until you actually start playing 
around,” adds Alexandrov.

Microbiomes:  
our humble overlords
In the seas, in the soil, on our skin, in our gut – even in sewage 
treatment plants – microbes play pivotal roles in health and 
disease. To decipher how they work and how they influence 
each other, their hosts and the environment, scientists 
throughout the world are sharing and comparing vast amounts 
of information, and EMBL-EBI’s data services help researchers 
to explore it

A 
microbiome is an 
ecosystem of microbes: 
bacteria, viruses 
and other creatures 
invisible to the naked 
eye. Microbes are masters of their 
environment, growing everywhere 
from icy permafrost to boiling deep-
sea vents, and influencing more of the 
living world than you might imagine.
Microbes are the great nitrogen fixers 
of our soil – in fact, with the right 
balance of them you can reduce the 
need for fertiliser to grow crops. They 
play a crucial role in our digestive 
systems – as anyone who has suffered 
an upset stomach after taking 
antibiotics knows from personal 
experience. They rule the seven seas, 
too – the microorganisms in our 
oceans play a vital role in absorbing 
carbon dioxide, helping to sustain a 
healthy atmosphere.
Every one of us depends on these 
ecosystems to stay alive, so we have 
a lot to gain from understanding how 
they function, fall apart and recover. 
For example, if you spray detergent to 
clean up an oil spill, you might break 
up the oil nicely but the detergent 
will stick around in the environment, 
potentially affecting marine life 
forms – effectively, you would be 
solving one problem only to create 
another.
Alternatively, you could use the right 
combination of microbes to remove 
that oil by breaking it down into 
harmless compounds like sugar. That 
would make it much easier to restore 
the microenvironment to its original 
state.
But how do you do that?
The microbiome challenge
The tricky thing is that most 
microbes are very difficult to 
study outside the context of their 
communities. This means scientists 
can’t grow the microbes in a Petri 
dish and analyse them in isolation. 
Instead, they must study the whole 
environment, look at all the genetic 
material in a sample and try to tease 
out what organisms it came from.
Describing microbiomes in detail – 
making a community directory – is 
really difficult, as the individuals 
aren’t easy to pinpoint.
So how do you find out who’s who, 
what they’re eating, and how they 
function? How can you pin down a 
beneficial chain of events in a given 
microbiome, such that you can 
manipulate it – returning it to health 
after the chain has been interrupted – 
or turn it to some new use, like sewage 
treatment or biofuel production?
Who’s who?
Humans are pretty good at 
sequencing DNA these days – 
everything from whole genomes 
of people and plants to pathogens 
lurking in a hospital environment, 
identified on-the-fly.
But DNA sequences are pretty 
meaningless unless you can compare 
them to a reference. That can tell 
you whether it’s a known sequence 
(which is pretty important) and, if so, 
what it is and what’s special about it. 
Then again, you might discover that a 
sequence is novel, because there is no 
reference in the public archive.
So far, so good. But what if you want  
to sequence a spoonful of soil, a 
bucket of seawater, a stool sample, 
a scraping of skin, a little patch of 
the forest floor – each of which has 
millions of microbes and an untold 
number of DNA sequences? You’ll 
end up with a huge amount of new 
information, all of which you want 
to compare to a reference archive at 
one go.
Does that even work?
Genomes within genomes
Yes, it does work. Studying the DNA 
sequences of a whole environmental 
sample, whether it’s from the sea or 
your skin, is called metagenomics 
– literally, the study of genomes 
within genomes. “You can take 
a mixture of microbes from an 
environment and use computational 
approaches to identify what’s in 
there, skipping the part where you 
separate out and culture individual 
viruses and bacteria,” explains Guy 
Cochrane, who runs the European 
Nucleotide Archive – a major source 
of reference sequences and, as part 
of the International Nucleotide 
Sequencing Consortium (INSDC), 
the engine driving much of genomics 
research today. “Collecting, 
sequencing and comparing samples 
is something scientists are pretty 
good at, so we can provide a strong 
start towards understanding 
what these communities are doing 
biochemically,” he adds.
“With environmental samples, you 
have to sequence so much stuff !” 
says Rob Finn, who runs EMBL-
EBI’s Metagenomics data service, 
which contains tens of thousands 
of analysed datasets representing 
genetic material from environmental 
samples. “Comparing the sequences 
found in one microbiome might be 
the equivalent to analysing a few 
thousand human genomes – that 
is simply a staggering amount of 
information. Our Metagenomics 
service helps people discover 
what is actually in their samples, 
and classify things that are being 
described for the first time.” >>

>>   “You can compare the DNA in 
a sample of contaminated soil to a 
clean sample from roughly the same 
place, or healthy gut to a diseased 
one, look for the differences and make 
some reasonable assumptions about 
what those genes are doing,” adds 
Finn. “We need to look beyond that, 
so we can start to see what makes 
one microbiome thrive and another 
languish. If we can manipulate these 
environments, we can start to solve 
some serious problems.”
Trending bugs
Anticipating disease outbreaks is 
an incredibly important application 
for metagenomics. The COMPARE 
project, an international pathogen-
surveillance network, uses genome 
sequencing technology and rapid data 
sharing to speed up the detection of 
infectious disease outbreaks.
COMPARE is working to set up 
monitoring of sewage treatment 
plants in cities throughout the 
world, looking at which bacteria are 
circulating in a population, and what 
infectious diseases may be brewing.
“In COMPARE, our colleagues are 
using advanced methods, including 
some developed in Rob’s team, 
sharing data as it is generated and 
using our cloud compute for some of 
the analyses. So they don’t have to 
worry about the infrastructure – they 
can get on with figuring out how these 
things are moving from place to place 
and evolving,” says Cochrane.
The microbiome as an organ
Microbiome research, like cancer 
research, is very, very broad and 
endlessly complex. It’s a poster child 
for ‘interdisciplinary research’, 
demanding expertise in many areas 
of science. “Studying the microbiome 
covers so many different areas that 
it brings together a hugely diverse 
community,” says Finn. “The people 
involved in international microbiome 
projects bring a lot of different 
knowledge to the table: microbiology, 
ecolog y, genetics, metabolomics, 
clinical research, healthcare, 
ecology, biodiversity... They’re 
specialists, bioinformaticians, 
citizen scientists, participants at all 
levels, and they need the right tools 
to get on with their part of the work.”
The human microbiome can be 
considered akin to the brain or 
another organ. After all, our bodies 
contain a substantial number of 
both parasites (the agents of disease) 
and symbionts (providing essential 
functions). At EMBL, several 
research groups are collaborating to 
understand the human microbiome 
and its role in our lives.
“Microbiomes are the focus of 
intense research at EMBL,” says 
Peer Bork, whose research group 
explores how the environment in the 
human gut influences how a person 
responds to a drug. “My group has 
been exploring microbial functions in 
the gut since 2004, and thanks to the 
Tara Oceans expeditions, we’ve also 
had the opportunity to compare these 
communities inside humans with 
those on the surface of the sea. It is 
endlessly fascinating – and useful – to 
see how life processes are connected 
and influence one another.”
Tara Oceans: marine 
microbiomes
The importance of plankton in 
maintaining the Earth’s climate 
cannot be understated – their 
communities absorb a staggering 
volume of carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere and release oxygen in 
exchange. Yet only a small fraction of 
these life forms have been classified 
and analysed.
To address this gap, EMBL scientists 
initiated and led the Tara Oceans

microbiomes of deep, shallow and 
coastal marine waters.
Big, smart data
Genome technology is advancing 
so quickly that it can be difficult to 
keep pace. EMBL-EBI teams work 
with researchers, data providers, 
technology companies and even 
biotech start-ups to make sure the 
right machinery is in place to keep 
science moving.
“Our goal is building knowledge, 
not just gathering data,” says Paul 
Kersey, who leads the Ensembl 
Genomes project at EMBL-EBI. “If 
you want to understand something 
as complex as a microbiome, you’ve 
got to have the best possible data on 
every level, and provide intelligent 
ways to cross-link and query them. 
It only works if you can present new 
information in the context of what is 
already known.
“This is precisely what the Ensembl 
Genomes service does. We bring 
together all the knowledge gained 
about the genomes of microbial life 
forms – linking historically well-
studied species with those only 
recently discovered.”
 “It’s all very exciting, and scientists 
are easily tempted to jump in and 
gather data very quickly, using 
the latest kit, and upload it into an 
archive as an afterthought,” says 
Cochrane.
“Our job is to normalise the data – no 
matter what technology was used – 
and connect it all up so that people 
can slice across it in interesting 
ways. That’s how you get researchers 
finding novel genes that influence 
diseases like Crohn’s, or discovering 
cold-loving enzymes that can take 
the place of detergents,” adds Finn.
What’s next? 
Microbiome research is very 
new, and changing rapidly as new 
technologies and approaches 
expeditions: an unprecedented effort 
that resulted in 35,000 samples of 
seawater, each of which contained 
millions of small organisms. The 
samples, studied using advanced 
microscopy from EMBL, were 
sequenced at Genoscope in France, 
generating over 7000 datasets. 
Teams of researchers all over 
the world delved into this richly 
described collection, bringing to 
light 40 million novel genes and a 
raft of discoveries about life in the 
world’s oceans.
Where can you find Tara Oceans 
data, and other marine datasets? 
At EMBL-EBI, of course. “We’ve 
worked with sequencing experts at 
Genoscope in France, our research 
colleagues at EMBL Heidelberg, data 
providers at Pangaea in Germany 
and many, many others to make Tara 
Oceans data available to everyone,” 
says Cochrane. “This was an 
extensive sampling programme that 
was well organised from the start, 
so we have rich information about 
their chemistry and environmental 
context. That makes these datasets 
incredibly valuable over the very 
long term, because people can use 
them over and over again, in new 
ways, well into the future.”
widen the range of questions we 
can address. At EMBL-EBI, the 
Finn team is collaborating with 
a company called BioCatalysts, 
using metagenomics to discover 
novel enzymes that could have 
industrial applications. Discovering 
these enzymes using a data-driven 
approach rather than carrying out 
chemical synthesis experiments 
would curb the generation of 
chemical waste.

marine research to participate 
in Ocean Sampling Day (OSD), a 
simultaneous sampling campaign 
of the world’s oceans, from the 
subtropical waters around Hawaii 
to the rather brisk rapids of the 
Fram Strait in the Arctic. By taking 
samples at the same time every 
year, the hundreds of scientists 
taking part in OSD are describing 
microbial diversity and function, 
which at present is very poorly 
understood, and identifying trends 
over time. Not working on a boat 
or in marine science? The OSD 
Citizen Science campaign welcomes 
everyone to collect marine microbes 
and environmental data to help 
scientists piece together a better 
understanding of the world’s oceans.
Want to know more about the 
human gut microbiome? The 
my.microbes project (initiated 
by EMBL scientists), the British 
Gut Project and the American Gut 
project all welcome citizen scientists 
to provide samples and information 
about diet and lifestyle. These 
projects, taken together, will help 
map the gut microbes of human 
populations throughout the world, 
building an understanding of how 
lifestyle choices and diet influence 
our microbiomes, and therefore our 
health.

Emmanuelle Charpentier, 
an alumna of the Nordic 
EMBL Partnership for 
Molecular Medicine, sheds 
light on how CRISPR-Cas9 
turned from a side project 
into a worldwide revolution
BY ISABELLE KLING  
AND MARGAUX PHARES

T
hree molecules are enough to alter a 
genome. And three years is how long it took 
microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier 
to discover not only how these molecules 
work together, but also how they can be used 
in a revolutionary gene-editing technique (published 
in Nature in 2011 and Science in 2012). This system, 
called CRISPR-Cas9, is a naturally occurring defence 
mechanism that enables bacteria to fight viral infections. 
As Charpentier and her collaborator Jennifer Doudna 
at the University of California, Berkeley found, though, 
it can also be easily manipulated to add or mutate genes. 
Like a set of microscopic scissors, the nuclease Cas9 can 
be programmed to find and cut any sequence of DNA.
How does CRISPR-Cas9 
work, and what makes it 
such a powerful technique to 
edit DNA?
Although it might seem strange, 
bacteria can also suffer from 
infections – by viruses called phages 
– and have developed an adaptive 
immune system as a result. This 
means that they can ‘remember’ 
phages that have infected them 
in the past and can fight more 
efficiently against them if they strike 
again. At a molecular level, this 
‘memory’ is made up of a small piece 
of phage DNA that is inserted into 
the bacteria’s genome and stored in 
a location called ‘clustered regularly

Infection Biology in Berlin. She has also co-founded two 
biotechnology companies (CRISPR Therapeutics and 
ERS Genomics) and has received numerous awards, 
including the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, the 
Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences and, most recently, 
the Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science.
EMBL got the opportunity to speak with Charpentier 
during this year’s EMBL Partnership Conference – 
Perspectives in Translational Medicine – in Heidelberg. 
She discussed with us her time at the Umeå University, 
the importance of basic research, and the far-reaching 
implications of CRISPR-Cas9 in our day-to-day lives.
interspaced short palindromic 
repeats’, or CRISPR. Think of it 
like the wall of a sheriff ’s office in a 
western movie, with mug shots of 
outlaws to catch. When the outlaws 
come back to town, the sheriff goes 
after them armed with a copy of their 
mug shots and a weapon. Similarly, 
when a phage strikes again, the 
immune system of the bacteria goes 
after it armed with a molecular 
mug shot – a single short piece of 
RNA that matches the viral DNA 
stored in its genome – and a pair 
of molecular scissors called Cas9. 
Another RNA, called tracrRNA, 
triggers the maturation of this viral 
RNA sequence. The complex formed 
by these three molecules – viral 
RNA, tracrRNA, and the DNA-
cutting enzyme Cas9 – recognises 
the invading DNA and snips it, thus 
disabling the phage and preventing 
infection.
CRISPR-Cas9 is easy to engineer: 
by modifying the sequence of the 
viral RNA, scientists can redirect 
the complex to another location on 
the DNA that will then be cut – like 
if someone gives the sheriff another 
mug shot of someone to catch. 
Our experiments showed that we 
could adapt this tool and use it to 
manipulate the DNA of any cell. We 
studied CRISPR-Cas9 initially in >> 
Partnership perspectives in 
Heidelberg 
Nearly 200 participants from EMBL and select 
partner institutes gathered in Heidelberg from 6–8 
June 2016 for the Perspectives in Translational 
Medicine conference. The second event of its kind, 
and the first hosted at EMBL, took place in the 
context of the EMBL Partnership Programme and 
brought together EMBL’s partner institutes operating 
in the field of molecular medicine. From PhD students 
to institute directors, participants exchanged 
expertise in connecting basic science with medical 
research, intent on strengthening networks and 
building new collaborations.
Their findings have led to a rapid expansion in 
applications of cut-and-paste genome-editing 
techniques. In particular, CRISPR-Cas9 holds immense 
potential for combating diseases – from altering the 
genomes of mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus to 
staving off infections by the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV). Human clinical trials to assess the 
effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas9 against three different 
types of cancer are due to begin in 2017. 
Charpentier’s career has advanced rapidly in the 
past four years: one of the two seminal publications 
on CRISPR-Cas9 (published in Science) is in the top 
5% of all research outputs scored by Altmetric, an 
alternative to traditional citation impact metrics to 
measure the impact of a publication. She is currently

>>   Streptococcus bacteria, but 
we now know a similar adaptive 
immune  system exists in 
approximately 40 percent of 
bacteria. 
What made you realise 
that you had discovered 
something big?
When I accepted my new position 
in Umeå in 2008, it took me almost 
a year to convince people to look 
at the connection of two systems 
– CRISPR and tracrRNA – that 
now defines the unique feature of 
the CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism. 
The CRISPR project was carried 
out with limited manpower and 
everyone else was very busy with 
other projects, which were more 
interesting than CRISPR-Cas9 
at first sight. Above all: who is 
interested in an adaptive immune 
system in bacteria, anyway?! 
I cared, because I started my career 
in the field of bacterial genetics 
and I had a hunch that something 
interesting could be there. So, I 
kept pushing the idea. When my 
student from my former position 
at the University of Vienna set her 
mind to some experiments, the 
results were exciting, unexpected, 
yet breathtakingly simple – and it 
became clear to me that we were 
potentially studying a totally 
unknown and unique mechanism. 
The environment within the Nordic 
EMBL Partnership for Molecular 
Medicine was instrumental in 
helping us to achieve these results. 
Like scientists at EMBL, young 
researchers there receive the 
resources and space needed to 
pursue fundamental questions. 
Like every scientist, I was in 
love with the mechanism I was 
studying. When you focus on the 
same mechanism and molecules 
every day, the moment when you 
finally understand how it functions 
always seems like a breakthrough. 
But the rest of the world might see 
it with different eyes, depending 
on whether or not it has useful 
applications right away. In the 
case of researching CRISPR-Cas9, 
my focus was on the science. I 
was really excited about what we 
had observed and I wanted to dig 
deeper into the workings of the 
mechanisms. The research projects 
in my laboratory have always had 
a focus on the understanding of 
basic mechanisms in bacteria that 
could lead to novel gene targeting 
technologies or novel anti-infective 
strategies. It was only when the 
technique attracted a number of 
high-profile awards, I then realised 
its global scope beyond the range of 
versatile applications.
The CRISPR-Cas9 system 
is now being used in almost 
every molecular biology lab 
in the world – how do you 
feel about that?
When it became clear that we 
could tweak this mechanism into a 
powerful gene-editing technology, 
I followed my initial interest in 
seeing the technology applied 
to the field of human medicine. 
It is quite rare in science to see 
the development of so many 
applications for one technology, and 
so quickly. Exactly how the different 
applications will develop in future 
is still hard to define, but I am very 
pleased to see that many medical 
geneticists are embracing it. In the 
long-term, it would be tremendous 
if CRISPR could directly treat 
human genetic disorders. I 
have co-founded, together with 
Rodger Novak and Shaun Foy, a 
biotech company called CRISPR 
Therapeutics with the goal of 
pushing forward this endeavour. 
However, it is also important that 
society and politicians understand 
and be mindful of the complex 
implications of this simple yet 
sophisticated and versatile 
technology. Further down the 
line some research or resulting 
applications, for example in relation 
to genetically modified organisms 
in agriculture, could require 
widespread societal discussion and 
debate. Ultimately, decisions will 
need to be made. It is important 
and very good that groups are 
forming at different levels to discuss 
the opportunities and potential 
consequences of the CRISPR-Cas9 
technolog y.
Do you think that being 
a woman has influenced 
your career? How could we 
improve the situation of 
women in science?
When it comes to my work, I want 
to be considered for my scientific 
expertise first and foremost. This 
is something that I’ve always 
fought for. I have always had 
reservations about politics based 
on quotas. I consider them plasters 
on a wound that will not make the 
wound disappear: only a change in 
mentality will end discriminations, 
like those against women. Ideally, 
you would hire people for their 
qualifications, research projects 
and whether they fit well in your 
work environment – not whether 
they are male or female. Strong 
education programmes focusing on 
these issues, from an early age, have 
the potential to change mentalities 
and thereby make progress on 
discrimination issues. But that will 
take some time. It’s not a question of 
being politically correct – it is one 
of observing a certain reality and 
questioning it.
Note from the Editors: Quotas are a matter 
of heated debate in science. We will be 
publishing interviews with people who offer 
different perspectives on the issue, so

or me, science is a way of life. I 
grew up in a family of doctors and 
was very used to hearing scientific 
discussions at the dinner table. 
My mum encouraged my interest 
by giving me books to read like 100 Important 
Discoveries. But I actually thought I would be 
a detective! In my mother tongue “detective” 
translates as “the one who is searching for 
the truth”, and in effect that is what we do as 
scientists. Every day we follow the principles 
observe, analyse, understand. There is a 
powerful expression: “to understand is to 
transform what is!” and the people who inspire 
me most are not only great scientists, but 
those who also manage to bring their science 
to people. There is no rule that all science has 
to have an application, but if there is scope to 
do so I think it’s our responsibility to facilitate 
that. A few years ago, a friend and I set up a 
biotechnology company: by understanding 
how proteins are built, we wanted to see if it 
was possible to build a collection of ‘molecular 
Lego bricks’ and design a smart, functional 
material. In the beginning this was basic 
scientific exploration, but then we wondered 
if it was feasible to use our method as ‘ink’ 
for 3D printing of human tissues. Indeed it 
was, and using living cells we printed part of 
a functional liver. The great hope is that this 
research could one day lead to alternatives for 
full-scale liver transplants. There is still a lot 
to figure out, but it’s been an exciting journey 
so far. Entrepreneurship really complements 
my academic work here in Hamburg and in the 
end – even if things don’t work out – it has been 
an enjoyable and fulfilling journey!

n the unusual setting of a brewery, I 
was tasked with introducing yeast’s 
other face to participants of the 
Friends of EMBL Frühschoppen – a 
traditional Sunday morning social 
gathering. Rather than using yeast to make 
beer or bread, I study the effects of genetic 
variation and how this propagates across 
multiple molecular levels to affect the cell. 
By understanding the basic principles of 
variation in this very simple organism, 
it is possible to also gain insights into 
human biology, health and disease. I was 
involved in planning the event at a very 
early stage and it forced me to think about 
my project in a completely different way 
– participants were thirsty to learn more! 
What I really like about being a postdoc 
at EMBL is the level of interactivity: we 
are encouraged to mingle and take part in 
activities with other people. This is good 
for the science because you learn about the 
activities of other groups and how that can 
be relevant to your research.

my outlook on life. I think, and worry,

perspective. Yet despite the challenges

I 
always had an inquisitive mind and was 
fascinated by chemistry, wanting to know the 
answers to questions such as: what is matter? 
What is an atom? What is a protein? And what is 
the role of chemistry in the life sciences? As a high 
school student in Zimbabwe, where very few girls joined 
science classes, a question of a very different nature 
got in the way: I am a woman – how can I be good in 
science and inspire other women? An inspiring teacher 
and mentors shone a light on opportunities for me to 
become one. I managed to see past the male-scientist 
stereotype and proceeded to do a PhD in Chemistry, in 
Cape Town, South Africa. Through collaborations and 
the desire to participate in interdisciplinary research 
in an international atmosphere a door was opened for 
me at EMBL-EBI. Here, I have the freedom to satisfy my 
curiosity in drug discovery and life sciences, working on 
target identification and validation of anti-tuberculosis 
compounds, aiming to help tackle a killer disease 
that affects millions worldwide. Having support from 
the EMBL community, opportunities to work with 
renowned scientists like John Overington, participating 
at local and international conferences and establishing 
collaborations helped me to excel.  The exposure, the 
experiences and the inspiration from female leaders such 
as Janet Thornton, former EMBL-EBI director, continue 
to shine the light on massive opportunities. Indeed, there 
are no limits, no boundaries and our potential is limitless 
– it is all about how you see yourself.

born with special powers. Of course people 
realise that X-men is not reality, but giving a talk with 
the movie gave me a chance to present to a large public 
audience what mutants are away from the world of 
Hollywood. We are all a little bit different and in some 
respects everyone is a ‘mutant’ because we all carry 
mutations in our genes – it is very normal to have 
mutants sitting next to you! My key message mirrored 
that of the film: don’t be afraid if something or 
someone looks different, it’s just a natural part of life.

in literature, art and – naturally as an 
Italian – singing, my career as a computer 
scientist has enabled me to be involved 
in creative collaborations with people 
in many different fields [see page 8]. 
EMBL is a great place because it nurtures 
creativity: I have had the opportunity to 
be free, independent and tackle problems 
with a lateral-thinking approach. It is 
also very family friendly. This is my first 
experience living abroad, and I came here 
to EMBL-EBI together with my family. 
There is a lot of support, an onsite nursery 
and I have even brought my kids into the 
office on occasions – they have been very 
welcome! This is important to me as I 
want to be a great dad, as well as a great 
researcher.

O
ne of the things I love most about science 
is connecting with many different 
people. I’ve been on Twitter since about 
2009 and have become part of a whole 
community that I wouldn’t otherwise 
come into contact with. You can ‘follow’ scientists 
you wouldn’t otherwise meet at conferences, and you 
can see what they are up to and interact with them 
on a virtual level, as well as being amongst the first 
to hear about new papers. I seem to be interacting 
with users based in Australia – who knows; maybe 
I’ll get the opportunity to move there next! I also 
participate in science outreach – I got in touch with 
a college near my hometown, and volunteered to 
talk to students about my experiences of what it’s 
like being a scientist. For students deciding what to 
study at university, it’s really hard to get a feeling 
for what a scientist actually does, so I aimed to give 
them an insight into my daily work in the wet lab. 
One key message is that scientific career paths are 
not set in stone and not to get too worried about 
making the ‘wrong’ decision. I have moved from 
one topic to another and all science is interlinked. 
There are also great possibilities to travel and work 
abroad – something I think also impressed them! 
After I had given one talk, teachers at the school asked 
me to speak to the other science classes – I think it 
really makes a difference for scientists to share their 
world in schools and it felt great to be there. I would 
definitely do it again.

Bruce Alberts on fixing the broken 
academic career pipeline
“We are producing more research scientists than 
academia can handle and doing nothing is not an 
option”. Renowned biochemist Bruce Alberts delivered 
this stark warning at EMBL’s Lifelong Learning in 
the Biomedical Sciences conference in Heidelberg on 
6 July, pointing to the need to change the way science 
is funded, staffed and organised. EMBL postdoc Julia 
Roberti spoke to him to find out more. 
What are the main challenges for young 
researchers?
By many measures we are currently in a golden 
age of the life sciences. Yet this disguises the fact 
that the training pipeline produces more scientists 
than relevant positions in academia or industry are 
capable of absorbing. This oversupply of scientists 
– and a scramble for limited resources – threatens 
to reduce scientific productivity, undermines career 
development and diminishes the attractiveness of our 
profession. Young researchers should be encouraged 
to carefully consider what they want for their future, 
focus much earlier on their career options, explore 
alternative paths and get trained if they find them 
attractive. We don’t want to discourage people from 
becoming scientists in academia, but they should 
go in with open eyes about the challenges of doing 
so. Alternative roles such as in education, policy, 
media, business and law can be hugely rewarding, and 
spreading scientists throughout these fields means 
they also become interpreters and connectors between 
the vibrant scientific community and other important 
enterprises with distinct cultures. 
If you could add a new chapter to your book, 
Molecular Biology of the Cell, what would it 
be about?
It would be great to have a chapter about what we don’t 
know. Often the public read that we have sequenced 
every human gene, but most never hear about what we do 
not understand about those genes. We fail to emphasise 
enough to funders how little we know and how important 
it is to solve the large number of present mysteries. 
What drew you to science in the first place?
My favourite class in high school was chemistry, and I 
thought I could use chemistry and be a doctor – at the 
time I didn’t know it was possible to be a professional 
scientist. As a pre-med at Harvard, we had to take a lot of 
science courses: the course laboratories were basically 
like cooking, and after two years of such labs, I asked to 
drop the practical part of my physical chemistry course. 
As an alternative I was invited to join a research lab. But 
in those days they didn’t tell you about that possibility 
until you asked! This was a great experience for me – 
finally discovering how science gets done – and I decided 
to follow a path in research. I am a big advocate for two 
things: getting rid of all those “cooking classes”, and 
giving every first year college student the opportunity 
to work in a research lab. We are losing a lot of potential 
scientists because they think science is boring – it’s not!

“In Europe, we have great ideas 
and excellent scientists,” says 
EMBL alumnus Marc Zabeau, who 
moderated a session of experts from 
venture capital and investment 
firms on ‘Coping with complexity 
and keeping European biotech 
competitive’. “But we’re missing 
the financial strength that the US 
ecosystem has. We’re also short on 
entrepreneurship. 
“You need an ecosystem to build a 
biotech industry, and this takes more 
than one generation,” continues 
Zabeau. “You need a critical mass 
of talent with young graduates who 
are excited in this field, you need 
entrepreneurs, and you need to learn 
from success stories.” 
Private investment and innovation 
can be risky – something that Zabeau 
has experienced first-hand. Within 
five years of leaving his position as an 
EMBL group leader in Cell Biology & 
Biophysics (1978–1983), he had built 
his own biotech services company. 
He soon realised that interest in 
his products did not match people’s 
willingness to pay for them, and 
the company went bankrupt. “I 
didn’t see this as a failure,” Zabeau 
says. “You have to make this kind 
of mistake once in your life to 
understand what entrepreneurship 
is all about.”
Serial entrepreneur
Rather than letting it stop him, 
Zabeau’s experience pushed him 
to become a serial entrepreneur. In 
2012, he founded Qbic, a venture 
capital fund that aims to transform 
technological discoveries in 
universities and research institutes 
into sustainable business – and 
he is optimistic European science 
can rise to funding and investment 
challenges. “The future is bright,” 
he says. “The generation of my 
kids is more entrepreneurial than

EMBL’s Heidelberg site hosts the inaugural 
European Conference of Life Science Funders 
and Foundations 
BY CAROLINE HADLEY
In this ‘Century of the Life Sciences’, 
researchers are increasingly 
supported by governments, 
funders and private citizens to 
address some of humankind’s most 
pressing challenges: preventing 
famine, mitigating global warming, 
protecting biodiversity, sourcing 
safe and renewable energy and 
meeting the biomedical needs of an 
ageing population.
The inaugural European Conference 
of Life Science Funders and 
Foundations, which took place in 
April, included talks from Leroy 
Hood, Tim Hunt and Mark Walport, 
and brought together life science 
researchers with representatives 
from business, foundations and 
research funding across Europe. The 
programme covered not only how 
research is changing, but also how 
funding is adapting in response – 
and what needs to change for Europe 
to remain competitive.
The scale and complexity of these 
challenges demands a long-term 
view, and participants at the event 
heard a wide range of perspectives 
on the issue. Delegates at the 
conference discussed emerging 
schemes and explored how new 
models of financial support – 
underpinned by entrepreneurship, 
philanthropy and private investment 
– could be used to greatest 
advantage, transforming discoveries 
into meaningful applications.

Maltese science: From Stone Age 
temples to the Maltese genome
As we welcome Malta as EMBL’s most recent member 
state, Maltese science writer Edward Duca looks back 
at the nation’s rich history of scientific contributions
When Malta joined the EU in 
2004, large-scale competitive 
funds became accessible to the 
nation’s scientists, transforming 
the country’s research landscape. 
In the twelve years since, the 
number of research publications 
by scientists based in Malta 
quadrupled. Even Zammit’s 
work is being upgraded. In an 
EU-Funded project to study the 
fragility and sustainability of 
Malta’s environment, geologists and 
archeologists are trying to figure out 
why the Temple people mysteriously 
disappeared around 2500 BC.
Biologists have also contributed 
to the knowledge of the country’s 
history, with the recent discovery 
that the Maltese population 
originates from 12th century 
Sicily. The finding, which settles a 
long-standing debate, stems from 
Science and research holds an 
important place in Maltese history. In 
the early 20th century, archeologist 
Sir Temi Zammit unearthed the 
remains of a hypogeum as well as 
megalithic temples, amongst the 
oldest freestanding structures on 
Earth – and now UNESCO World 
Heritage Sites. 
But this just scratches the surface of 
Zammit’s contributions. A polymath 
who was rector of the University of 
Malta, Zammit also discovered the 
cause of Malta fever (Brucellosis 
melitensis), a disease that had 
afflicted the Island’s population and 
the British Navy. A few decades later, 
Censu Tabone, who would go on to be 
Malta’s president, led the efforts that 
eliminated trachoma – a common 
disease that can lead to blindness 
– from the Maltese island of Gozo, 
and campaigned for its treatment in 
Taiwan, Indonesia and Iraq. 
the ambitious Maltese Genome 
Project, which aims to sequence 
the DNA of 4,000 Maltese people. 
The reference genome from the 
project will be used in numerous 
biomedical studies, from cancer to 
heart attacks.
Maltese scientists are not only 
analysing the population’s genes 
but also their brains. The newly 
established Malta Neuroscience 
Network covers research including 
whether specific nutrients in the 
Mediterranean diet can mitigate 
Alzheimer’s disease, how marijuana 
could be used to treat epilepsy, using 
fruit flies to test new therapies for 
spinal muscular atrophy, and more. 
The work underscores an exciting 
future for Maltese science, with 
its ties to the life science research 
community in Europe further 
strengthened by becoming a member 
state of EMBL and EMBO.

We need to work together to make 
sure that open science develops in 
the right way to make the EU more 
competitive and maintain excellence 
in science. This requires the 
involvement of all key stakeholders 
involved, including publishers, 
research performing organisations, 
research funding organisations, and 
businesses, and will imply a review 
of how science is evaluated, the 
creation of new research funding 
mechanisms and alternative ways of 
publishing.

NEWS.EMBL.DE /?p =7416
How might the scientific 
community work more 
effectively on such issues?
In our Horizon 2020 projects, open 
access to results and publications is 
already the norm and we have been 
running a pilot initiative on open 
research data generated by Horizon 
2020 projects. But policies are not 
enough and, to gain leadership, we 
must also invest in the necessary 
infrastructure. For Europe’s 
1.7 million researchers and 70 
million science and technology 
professionals, we will create a 
new European Open Science 
Cloud: a virtual environment to 
store, share and re-use their data 
across disciplines and borders. 
Researchers and innovators will be 
able to access and re-use data, while 
reducing the cost of data storage 
and high-performance analysis.
We have the full support of the 
European Member States on this: 
in late May, the Competitiveness 
Council adopted the concusions of 
the European Council on “Open, 
data-intensive and networked 
research as a driver for faster and 
wider innovation” which states 
that Member States “look forward 
to the possible development of 
action plans or strategies for open 
science”. Member States have 
also expressed interest in the 
development of a European Open 
Science Agenda.
From potential to policy
Integrated initiatives, creative collaboration 
and open objectives topped the agenda as

What were your main goals 
during your visit of EMBL and 
EMBO? 
The meeting in Heidelberg was a 
great chance to discuss some of the 
many common goals of the European 
Commission, EMBO and EMBL – 
 I feel that the Commission should 
always be involved in discussions 
on the molecular life sciences at the 
European level. I also wanted to 
show support for both EMBL and 
EMBO signing the San Francisco 
Declaration on Research Assessment 
(DOR A), and highlight our viewpoint 
that, although the Impact Factor is 
an easy and well-known indicator of 
research performance, others should 
also be considered, which is why 
we have set up an expert group on 
Alternative Metrics.
This visit was also the ideal platform 
to discuss progress, successes and 
areas for potential improvement 
for the newly-signed EC-EMBL 
Work Plan 2016-2017; this outlines 
common objectives in areas such 
as research infrastructures and 
e-infrastructures, personalised 
medicine, research data sharing, 
mobility and training of excellent 
researchers.
I was also interested in engaging in 
active discussion on how we could 
work together to fulfil the common 
goals of open science and open 
innovation.

The pheromones 
behind romance
Takefumi Kikusui, a researcher 
from Azabu University, Japan, 
visited EMBL in Monterotondo to 
understand the molecular basis of 
our sense of connection
BY ISABELLE KLING
From finding an ideal partner to the curious relationship 
we share with our canine friends, bonding behaviour 
is guided by some very complex – some might say 
“unromantic” – biochemistry. Takefumi Kikusui, from 
the School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, 
Japan, is hoping the inspiring environment of EMBL 
Monterotondo, just a stone’s throw from romantic Rome, 
could help him in his quest to explore the hormones 
and pheromones that interact with the ‘social brains’ 
of animals – including humans – and affect behaviour. 
Kikusui was invited by EMBL’s Cornelius Gross, a 
neurobiologist who focuses on fear and anxiety, to mobilise 
the chemistry between their fields of research, which both 
seek to understand why we do what we do. We caught up 
with Kikusui to find out more.
What are your research interests?
I am a behavioural neurobiologist with a specific focus on 
what we call the ‘social brain’ and the neural processes 
that control bonding in different ways. I am also interested 
in how these behaviours change depending on the 
environment in which one grows up. Oxytocin, for example, 
seems to work very similarly between mice and humans 
to foster social interactions. Its level rises in both mothers 
and their pups when they are together; this is very similar 
to what we observe when dogs and their human masters 
look at each other. However its reputation as the “cuddle 
hormone” is a huge over-simplification: its effects are 
very complex and we need to study them more. Another 
example are the stress hormones called glucocorticoids: 
pups separated from their mothers early in life secrete such 
hormones, and tend to show more fearful and aggressive 
behaviour later in life. Interestingly, the same seems to be 
true in humans where children exposed to psychological or 
physical abuse are themselves more abusing and violent in 
adulthood. Understanding these mechanisms could have 
medical implications.  
What is your impression of EMBL?
It is my second visit to EMBL’s campus in Monterotondo: 
coming back now is very interesting to see firsthand how 
Cornelius’s lab and his research have moved forward, but 
also to get another taste of the fantastic Italian coffee. Last 
time I came was also during the football World Cup and 
Italy had qualified. There was a great atmosphere and the 
football fan in me was obviously enthusiastic!
Are you formally collaborating with EMBL 
already?
Not yet, but one of the postdocs in Cornelius’ lab is 
starting to use a behavioral test we developed and we will 
be collaborating to carry out the study. I would also be 
interested to host researchers from EMBL in my lab in 
Japan for several months to help us set up the equipment 
and the procedures necessary to work with transgenic mice.

Unexpected adventures at EMBL 
LearningLAB focused on biodiversity
BY ADAM GRISTWOOD
“You might want to cover your 
ears,” smiles Philipp Gebhardt, 
head of EMBL’s European Learning 
Laboratory for the Life Sciences 
(ELLS), looking out over the 
meadows that roll up to the rocky 
cliff face of Nußloch Quarry in the 
distance. Two dozen schoolteachers 
and teacher trainers are stood 
behind a safety barrier, here as 
part of a LearningLAB focussed on 
bringing bioinformatics into the 
classroom. It is an unlikely location 
for a lesson in computer science, and 
the group has carefully collected 
plant samples for analysis in the 
teaching labs at EMBL’s Heidelberg 
site 12 kilometers away. But before 
that there is a surprise in store. 
Suddenly, a loud explosion rings 
out across the quarry, sending 
tonnes of sediment tumbling 
to the foot of the mine. It’s an 
intimidating sight: plumes of 
dust are thrown into the air and a 
brigade of diggers wait impatiently 
to snap up the haul, which will 
be used by building materials 
company HeidelbergCement. But 
while quarries are destructive by 
reputation, when carefully managed 
and restored they provide important 
habitats for a wide range of flora 
and fauna – including rare birds, 
amphibians and plants such as 
wild orchids. Participants are here 
to learn how modern molecular 
methods can be used to study this 
rich biodiversity.
Real insights
“Our goal is to provide training 
for accessible, hands-on lessons 
that convey the excitement of real 
science,” says Gebhardt. In the 
training lab, teachers adorn lab 
coats and start getting to grips 
Bioinformatics 
with a bang
with an array of pipettes, solutions, 
centrifuges, water baths and rubber 
gloves. Under the guidance of EMBL 
scientists and ELLS educators, 
they extract DNA from samples, 
amplify the barcode regions using 
the polymerase chain reaction and 
prepare them for sequencing. 
“It’s challenging, but there has been 
lots of support from experts,” says 
Niti Dhingra, a secondary school 
biology teacher from Berlin, pleased 
with her progression during the 
three-day LearningLAB. When the 
sequences are returned the following 
day, the group analyses and compares 
the data from their samples, making 
use of EMBL-EBI’s European 
Nucleotide Archive, to evaluate the 
diversity of plants collected. “Each 
course is supported by specialised 
education resources developed by 
the ELLS team,” explains Eva Haas, 
an ELLS education officer. “We want 
to inspire teachers by providing a 
direct connection between classroom 
exercises and science in practice.”
 
Modernising methods
The course is packed out with 
seminars, lab tours and social 
activities, and is part of a wider 
programme that delivers several 
courses each year, with the ultimate 
goal of modernising science teaching. 
“We can immediately pass on what 
we have learnt,” says Marinke van 
der Velde of the Institute for Teacher 
Training in Rotterdam as the 
LearningLAB reaches its conclusion, 
the bioinformatics analysis of the 
DNA barcodes underscoring the high 
diversity of plant life in the quarry 
environment. “It’s one of the best 
courses I have been on,” she adds.

Community management
Scientific community manager and EMBL 
alumnus Aidan Budd explains the challenges and 
rewards of bringing together researchers with 
shared interests, values and goals
I look back at photographs from 
nearly 20 years ago and I barely 
recognise myself – and not just 
because the hair on my head now 
sprouts out of my chin! I was 
somewhat shy when I joined EMBL 
in Heidelberg as a summer student 
in 1998. But while my network was 
small, I found EMBL and the science 
happening on site incredible. I was 
hooked. 
I returned to EMBL to do my PhD in 
Toby Gibson’s group, and after trying 
my hand as a commissioning editor 
I returned for a second time to work 
on training, service and research 
initiatives in bioinformatics. The 
role required substantial networking 
with colleagues from many different 
fields. And the more I networked, the 
more I discovered I love community-
focused work. These experiences 
provided a bridge to my ultimate 
role at EMBL, as a project manager 
focused on scientific community 
building.
Community management
Communities come in all shapes 
and sizes, but one common goal of 
scientific community managers is 
to help people with shared interests, 
values and goals find ideas for 
collaboration – and then make it as 
easy as possible to put these ideas 
into practice together.
EMBL has a very special culture 
of collaboration – there is great 
openness and many opportunities 
for interaction between people and 
teams. The first major community 
initiative I worked on was the Bio-IT 
Project at EMBL’s Heidelberg site, 
supporting EMBL staff working 
with computers to analyse biological 
data. This involved developing an 
interactive web platform, training 
events, surveys, meetings, and 
more. I have also helped build other 
communities in and beyond EMBL, 
including a long-running series 
of events called the Heidelberg 
Unseminars in Bioinformatics 
(HUB) and unconference sessions 
and collaborations at various 
conferences and other events.  
Most of the projects I have worked 
on are mainly driven by the work of 
volunteers. For example, HUB turns 
the standard meeting format on 
its head, uniting people from many 
different disciplines for participant-
driven workshops. Identifying 
people who want to get involved lies 
at the heart of community-building 
work. 
People person
My expertise in community building 
has been largely self-taught, and 
it has been a steep learning curve 
at times – something unexpected 
can happen at any moment, and it 
often does! One challenge comes 
in balancing the desire to make 
exciting things happen quickly with 
more strategic long-term objectives. 
But if you like working with people 
and are well organised you could 
be well suited to a community 
management role. I have connected 
with truly inspiring colleagues, 
many who have become friends, built 
valuable and enjoyable professional 
relationships, and am happy to work 
in a role that my younger-self might 
not have dared imagine. 
Senior Project Manager Aidan Budd 
said farewell to EMBL in June with 
a scientific speed-dating event that 
reflected the mission of his role: to 
bring together people.

bacteria constellations that serve as 
warning signs for colon cancer.
Darren Gilmour and Jan Korbel, 
Group leaders at EMBL Heidelberg, 
have been named in EMBO’s 
list of new members, elected in 
recognition of their contributions to 
scientific excellence. In total, EMBO 
membership now comprises more 
than 1700 of the best researchers 
in Europe and around the world, 
whose input has helped to promote 
excellence in life sciences since 
1964. With emphasis always on 
scientific merit, EMBO Members 
apply their expertise and insight to 
guide the execution of the EMBO 
initiatives and collectively serve the 
research community.
Group leader Christian Häring has 
been awarded a prestigious 2 milion 
Euro Consolidator Grant from 
the European Research Council 
to reveal the elusive mechanisms 
behind the functions of the condensin 
protein complex. Condensin plays 
a fundamental role in changes in 
the structure of chromosomes, but 
its mechanisms are not currently 
understood. By combining structural 
biology with biochemical and cell 
biological methods, Häring seeks 
to change that. He aims to unravel 
how condensin coordinates with 
DNA to influence chromosome 
architecture, which could shed light 
on how genomic integrity is affected 
in various diseases. 
EMBL Director Matthias Hentze 
has been elected as a Corresponding 
Member of the Australian Academy 
of Science in recognition of 
his pioneering RNA research. 
The Academy is a not-for-profit 
organisation of individuals elected 
for their outstanding contributions to 
science and research. Corresponding 
members are a special category 
within the Academy’s Fellowship 
that comprises eminent international 
scientists with strong ties to 
Australia.
The Miklós Bodanszky Award, 
presented in commemoration of the 
chemist’s outstanding contributions 
to peptide science, was this year 
awarded to group leader Maja Köhn. 
The award acknowledges scientists 
who make significant contributions 
to peptide-based drug research 
within 10 years of obtaining their 
PhD degree. Maja Köhn is recognised 
for her critical contributions to the 
design of peptides targeting protein 
phosphatases that are involved in 
diseases such as cancer and diabetes. 
EMBL Director-General Iain Mattaj 
has been elected as a Fellow of the 
Academy of Medical Sciences. The 
Academy of Medical Sciences is 
an independent organisation that 
campaigns to ensure advances in 
medical science are translated into 
benefits for patients – its Fellows 
represent the UK’s leading medical 
scientists. Iain Mattaj was elected 
alongside more than 40 new fellows 
in recognition of contributions to 
medical research and healthcare, 
the generation of new knowledge in 
medical sciences and its translation 
into benefits to society.
Kjetil Taskén, Director of the 
Centre for Molecular Medicine 
Norway (NCMM) and recently 
renewed as speaker of the Nordic 
EMBL Partnership for Molecular 
Medicine, has received the King Olav 
V’s Cancer Research Prize. Awarded 
by the Norwegian Cancer Society, the 
1 million NOK (105 000 Euro) prize 
is presented annually to researchers

industry by way of the Judge Business 
School at the University of Cambridge. 
“Starting your own business is about 
mindset: believing you can do it, 
seeing it like a job and jumping into it. 
When I started I knew nothing  
about business. I’d done my PhD and  
worked in bioinformatics, a trendy 
field, but I didn’t have the tools to 
start a company.”
Location, location, location 
Location played no small part in 
Ureta-Vidal’s career change. “Here in 
Cambridge, you can do both academic 
and commercial research, and you 
get a lot of exposure to entrepreneurs, 
start-ups, role models,” he says.  
“That is so valuable – if you don’t have 
this kind of environment, you won’t 
see the possibilities that may be open 
to you.”
Ureta-Vidal worked on the Ensembl 
genomic data resource for six years 
before acting as a consultant. He then 
joined forces with Eagle Genomics 
co-founder Will Spooner and grew 
the company from there. Eagle 
Genomics brings profound domain 
knowledge to big-data projects, not 
just solving problems for companies 
by creating technologies to prepare 
data for machine-learning, but 
empowering them to find their own 
way. “We work on the premise that 
our clients are not looking for a drill, 
but they’re trying to make a hole,” he 
explains. “They don’t want to ‘do big 
data,’ or machine learning, but they 
want to reposition drugs, or identify 
the neutral microbiome so they can 
create a winning product.”
Hard graft pays off
Collaborations between start-ups 
and academia can be tricky because 
the legal environment is complex, 
but there is a lot to be gained from 
informal interactions, says Ureta-

“You shouldn’t worry too much 
about giving your ideas away,” 
he says. “There is so much more 
to making something profitable 
– you should worry more about 
whether you’re up for a lot of hard 
work, and learning some very hard 
lessons about risk, collaborations 
and IP.” Ureta-Vidal believes all 
scientists should receive basic 
business education and gain hands 
on experience. His top advice to 
budding entrepreneurs? “Start 
earlier than I did, when it’s not so 
hard to take risks, and don’t ever 
get too comfortable. You’ve got to 
prepare for the next step.”
So what’s the next step for Ureta-
Vidal? “After eight years, I am 
looking into new possibilities,” he 
smiles. “I’m finally able to step back 
and watch the company function 
on its own. That is something I’m 
really proud of.”

(1995 – 9) 
Now: Scientific Director, 
Immunology Network, GSK
Connecting ideas and discovery
EMBL alumna Louise Modis is a 
driving force in GSK’s Immunology 
Network, a fresh take on 
commercial-academic collaboration.
“Bridging the gap between ideas 
and discovery is what we’re trying 
to do, and that takes challenging 
one another more,” says Modis, 
whose experience as an EMBL 
PhD student brought home the 
importance of defending questions 
rigorously. “We can’t do it without 
an interdisciplinary community 
because there’s only so much any one 
of us can know.”
Creative communities
Modis is actively involved in the 
GSK Immunology Network, which 
provides a new way for researchers 
working in companies and academic 
settings to collaborate. 
“After leaving EMBL I assumed 
I’d only be able to find the kind 
of collaborative, questioning 
environment I’d enjoyed so much at 
EMBL at an academic institute. But 
I have found such an environment 
throughout my experience in 
the sector – first at Millennium 
Pharmaceuticals, then at Boehringer 
Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, and 
now at GSK,” she says.
At the May 2016 EMBL Alumni 
event in Cambridge, Modis 
stressed the importance of gaining 
experience in both commercial and 
academic sectors. For example, 
the Immunology Network features 
a sabbatical programme (the 
Immunology Catalyst) at GSK 
where researchers with big ideas 
can spend a percentage of their 
time, benefiting from GSK’s science, 
resources and technologies to 
pursue interesting questions in 
ways they couldn’t easily achieve in 
their academic labs.
“Being co-located makes a huge 
difference because it’s so much 
easier for people to keep asking 
each other tough questions, which 
makes the research better,” says 
Modis. “At EMBL it was easy to 
ask, ‘Why not?’ We were working 
together constantly in this creative 
and collaborative environment, and 
it was taken as read that we were 
working towards a common goal.”
Making a difference
Industry needs more ‘constructive 
disruptors’, says Modis, to achieve 
breakthroughs. “The immunology 
network is pre-competitive, and 
provides a way for researchers with 
very different styles and approaches 
to work on innovative ideas in the 
same physical space,” she adds. 
“That’s how we’re going to achieve 
breakthroughs that lead to better-
designed medicines, and solutions 
that make a difference in people’s 
lives.”

EMBL’s early excitement
Postdoc: platform for success
EMBL was already an exciting place 
in the early 80s: both the institute 
and the gene expression programme 
were very young, powered by a small 
but vibrant community of around 
200 scientists. We all had the 
feeling of being part of something 
new and exciting, which would 
allow us to open new ‘boxes’ of 
knowledge without the pressure to 
deliver specific applications.
Breaking boundaries
Strong in my memory are “wow!” 
conferences covering the discovery 
of the first oncogenes, as well as 
Walter Gehring’s landmark talk on 
Antennapedia. This spirit of going 
beyond current knowledge and always 
preparing for the next steps has shaped 
my approach to science. During my 
EMBL years, I studied transcription 
mediated by polymerase 2 and 3, 
mostly in liver cells. Like most alumni, 
I specialised after leaving EMBL – 
but I also kept one eye on the ‘bigger 
picture’. I still work on the same tissue, 
but new technologies and ‘big data’ are 
allowing us to dig much deeper into the 
complexity of the processes. 
Next-generation scientists
Many of the talks at the event were 
focused on networks of molecules: I 
find this topic absolutely fascinating! 
As a professor, I want to convey this 
fascination for learning to my students 
and in turn make a strong contribution 
to training the next generation of 
motivated young scientists.
Five years as a postdoc in Cornelius 
Gross’ group have proven crucial 
to my career as a researcher. They 
were also extremely enjoyable from 
a personal perspective: EMBL really 
is a place that cares for its staff and 
where you are certain to meet great 
people.
Creative connections
Before my postdoc, my research focus 
was on behaviour and I used very 
little molecular biology. Studying 
gene expression and its links to the 
environment with Cornelius Gross 
allowed me to bridge that gap and 
make contributions to understanding 
the connections between experiences 
animals have as youngsters and their 
behaviour later in life. Cornelius is a 
great inspiration and a very important 
colleague.
Bringing light to behaviour
My current work focuses on the 
impact of the environment on young 
animals and the onset of mental 
health disorders later in their lives. 
We proved that mice pups who grow 
up in an aggressive environment tend 
to be more prone to cocaine addiction 
as adults; on the other hand, pups 
who grow alone, with little social 
interactions, tend to be more prone 
to depression in their adulthood. In 
both cases we are able to link the 
behaviours to specific gene expression 
patterns, and that could give us clues 
to understanding similar patterns in 
humans.
Italian interconnections
Rome was the destination for 80 alumni and 
people from their networks to participate in an 
‘EMBL in Italy’ event on 27 May to learn about the 
focus of researchers at EMBL’s Monterotondo site. 
The event brought participants together to share 
their research directions and spread the word 
about EMBL’s opportunities and resources.

Taking science  
to new dimensions
Angela Relogio was one of 15 former EMBLers who participated 
at the Max Delbrück Center (MDC) Career Day in Berlin, 
representing the EMBL alumni community as speaker and 
advocate at the EMBL careers stand. Here she tells us about her 
passion for science, communication and mentoring
BY CAROLINE HADLEY
“There is a certain thrill about 
doing science which is contagious, 
communicable – one gets it and 
passes it on.” For EMBL alumna 
Angela Relogio, embarking on 
groundbreaking research is not 
enough. She is passionate about 
sharing her knowledge by teaching, 
mentoring and encouraging others. 
Originally from Portugal, Relogio 
joined EMBL’s International 
PhD Programme in 1999. After 
completing her PhD and a postdoc, 
she moved to Berlin’s Humboldt 
University to become a research 
scientist at the Institute for 
Theoretical Biology. Relogio then 
moved to the Charité Medical 
University in Berlin, where she has 
been a research group leader in the 
get involved,” she explains. “At almost 
all stages of a scientific career, one can 
be of great support to other scientists 
or scientists-to-be.” 
Relogio also applies her diverse 
experiences to mentoring others. 
“I advise and discuss problems 
and uncertainties with colleagues 
that I also experienced at the same 
career stage,” she says. “Honesty 
is crucial: most scientists have had 
misunderstandings with supervisors, 
grants that failed, experiments that 
didn’t work, and papers that just 
couldn’t get accepted. It is important 
to talk with others who have also gone 
through the same situations and to 
realise that there are many ways to be 
successful in science.”
But it’s not just science that moves 
Relogio to inspire others: away from 
the lab, she is a qualified diving 
instructor, practices karate and runs 
half-marathons – all while raising a 
young family. “It’s quite an adventure, 
but achievable ... using some 
imagination!”
Molecular Cancer Research Centre 
since 2014.
When leaving EMBL in Heidelberg, 
Relogio took with her what she calls 
“the EMBL spirit.” “The EMBL spirit 
embodies an incredible thirst for 
knowledge and an infinite curiosity,” 
she explains. This feeds not only her 
ongoing activities with the EMBL 
alumni programme, but also her 
research, studying the mammalian 
circadian clock and its role in cancer. 
But in addition to running her lab, 
Relogio is active in promoting, 
communicating and teaching 
science to students of all ages. “I 
want to lift the ‘curtain of mystery’ 
that surrounds scientific work, and 
encourage young girls in particular to

Give EMBL alumnus Jochen Wittbrodt ten 
minutes of your time, and he’ll convince 
you just how much biologists have to gain 
from embracing the impossible, pursuing 
outlandish ideas, and living on the edge
BY SONIA FURTADO NEVES
Wittbrodt clashed with the 
impossible in his very first position 
as group leader, at the Max Planck 
Institute for Biophysical Chemistry 
in Göttingen. He decided to run 
genetic screens on Medaka fish. In a 
genetic screen, scientists introduce 
mutations into an organism’s 
genes, and systematically look 
at the effects of those mutations 
on aspects like physical traits, 
physiology and behaviour. This is 
a laborious process – and was even 
more so back in the early 1990s, 
when gene sequencing was in its 
infancy – so the labs carrying out 
such studies tended to rely on a large 
workforce, and focus on established 
model organisms such as zebrafish. 
So Wittbrodt’s proposal to tackle 
a species for which no-one had yet 
developed specific tools, with a lab of 
6 people, was met with scepticism. 
“But we just did it, and it worked,” he 
chuckles.
Birth of SPIM
A decade later, he had set up a lab 
at EMBL, and a presentation at a 
conference sparked another daring 
idea. “Pete Curry was showing an 
image of a whole fish in 3D imaged by 
a new method called OPT,” he recalls. 
“When I came back to Heidelberg,

people happy,” he concedes. “But 
there are others who like to maybe 
bridge the boundaries and live in the 
interface, and try to get new ideas 
at the edges – this is much more the 
way I see myself. I wouldn’t say that 
I’m a zoologist, or a geneticist, or 
a cell biologist; I need a little bit of 
everything.”
To anyone who feels similarly, and 
has an ‘impossible’ idea that just 
might work, he says: “follow your 
heart; trust your gut!”
A lumni Profile Swimming        against the tide
I met Ernst Stelzer in the EMBL 
cafeteria, and I said: ‘We need that, 
but we need it in live fish!’” Wittbrodt 
eventually convinced Stelzer to put a 
student on the job, and single-plane 
illumination microscopy (SPIM) was 
born. The basic idea of SPIM sounded 
like science fiction, says Wittbrodt: 
having a living organism under the 
microscope, shining a sheet of light on 
one layer of cells at a time, and putting 
that information back together to get 
a picture of the whole animal. The 
technique enabled Wittbrodt’s lab 
to see a fish embryo’s beating heart, 
and to trace its optic nerve from eye 
to brain. But he saw an opportunity 
to probe deeper – another ‘wild idea’: 
tracking each cell in an embryo, as 
they divide and move throughout the 
first day of its life. “Textbooks said 
you couldn’t do this in a vertebrate,” 
he says, “until Philipp Keller, who 
was then a PhD student in the Stelzer 
group, developed Digital Scanned 
Laser Light Sheet Microscopy 
(DSLM), and we saw how long we 
could image embryos for – and then 
we went for it!” The result, which they 
dubbed the Digital Embryo, earned 
How does he keep up his own drive in 
such situations, and keep swimming 
against the current? “Some people 
see the problems along the way, but 
forget what we’re aiming at. I think 
I can worry about a problem, but if I 
have an aim, I’ll find a solution, a way 
around it,” he replies.
Radical vision
Fostering and developing this type 
of unconventional approach is 
something that Wittbrodt has built 
into the workings of his lab at the 
University of Heidelberg. “I always 
give some ‘crazy vision’ talk once a 
year, at one of our lab meetings,” he 
says. One of the ideas he presented 
at this year’s talk was a new way to 
probe what conditions stem cells 
need in order to grow. His vision: to 
print an unconventional 3D scanner. 
“This scanner would not be a 
scanner in the sense that it scans 
your material; instead, your material 
– in our case stem cells – would 
scan the scanner,” he explains. The 
idea would be to use 3D printing 
technology to create a habitat for 
cells; hundreds of thousands of

I’ll find a solution”
them recognition from Science as one 
of the breakthroughs of the year for 
2008. 
Since leaving EMBL, Wittbrodt 
has continued to work on further 
developments to the technology, 
collaborating with Lars Hufnagel 
in particular.  He has another wild 
idea up his sleeve. “You’d have the 
fish swimming freely, and passing 
through a laser scanner, being imaged 
as it goes.” Such a naturalistic setting 
would allow scientists to probe 
questions that are currently out of 
bounds, but so far, this particular 
idea has proven too ‘sci-fi’ for even 
Wittbrodt to get anyone to bite on.
alcoves with different properties – 
some spongier, some harder, some 
with one type of food, others with 
another... Wittbrodt and colleagues 
would place their stem cells on this 
habitat, and let the cells choose their 
niche. “And we could just read out 
the properties and know what the 
stem cell needs,” he says, noting that 
he already has engineers, chemists 
and physicists, as well as specialists 
in 3D printing, on board.
Biologists have to be conversant in 
other fields in order to dream up – 
and implement – these approaches, 
he emphasises. “Specialisation gives 
you more details, and will keep some
