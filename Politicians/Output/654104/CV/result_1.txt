BIOGRAPHY & SCIENTIFIC ACHEIVEMENTS 
Dr. Cornelius Gross has been a group leader at the Epigenetics & Neurobiology Unit of the European Molecular 
Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Rome since 2003. In 2009 he was promoted to Senior Scientist and since 2020 
he is Interim Head of Unit. His research aims to understand the neural circuit mechanisms controlling instinctive 
behaviors with a special focus on fear and anxiety. He has also carried out research into the developmental 
origins of behavioral traits and has worked extensively on the role of microglia in shaping the developing brain. 
In 2011 he published a landmark paper – cited over 2700 times – that establishing a role for microglia in the 
elimination of synapses. Dr. Gross was raised in the United States and received undergraduate training in 
biophysics at the University of California, Berkeley and then pursued doctoral research at Yale University 
studying transcriptional regulation by homeodomain factors with William McGinnis. Dr. Gross then joined the 
group of René Hen at Columbia University as a postdoctoral fellow where he discovered a developmental role 
for serotonin in determining life-long anxiety-related behavior and identified the serotonin receptor responsible 
for the therapeutic effects of antidepressants. In his early work at EMBL he showed how deficits in serotonin 
autoregulation can cause sudden infant death syndrome and how serotonin moderates the impact of maternal 
care on anxiety traits in adulthood. Since 2010 his laboratory is focused on characterizing the hypothalamic 
and  brainstem  circuits  that  regulate  social  and  predator  fear  and  understanding  the  role  of  microglia  in 
determining the wiring of behavioral circuits during development. In 2013 he was awarded an Advanced Grant 
from the European Research Council (ERC) to study social and predator fear circuits in the brain. His team 
has shown that distinct subcortical circuits are recruited in response to different types of threat, with defensive 
responses to painful stimuli, predators, and conspecifics mediated by distinct pathways (Gross & Canteras, Nat 
Rev Neurosci 2012;  Silva et al., Nat Neurosci 2013;  Montardy et al., Brain Struct Funct 2020).  These  data 
argue that pathological fear comes in different flavours and is amenable to selective therapeutic treatment. 
Current  work  in  the  group  is  aimed  at  understanding  how  hypothalamic  and  brainstem  circuits  transform 
information about threat stimuli to trigger defensive behaviour, and how this process is remodelled by social 
experience and context (Masferrer et al., J Neurosci 2020; Krzywkowski et al., eLife 2020). Earlier in his career 
Dr. Gross served for two years as a science teacher at a public high school in New York City, where he gained 
an appreciation for the benefits and challenges of communicating science to a lay audience. He is married with 
three children and lives in Rome, Italy.

this receptor controls anxiety behavior via a developmental programming mechanism (Gross 
et al., [2002] Nature 416, 396-400 – 1034 citations; Gross & Hen, [2004] Nature Rev Neurosci 
5, 545-552 – 614 citations) 
1989-1995 Predoctoral Fellow with W. McGinnis, Department of Mol. Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale 
University, CT; PhD thesis: “DEAF-1, a novel protein which binds an essential region in a Dfd 
response element” – addressed the problem of poor homeodomain DNA binding specificity by 
identifying and cloning a cofactor that bound to a genetically defined regulatory target (Gross, 
& McGinnis, [1996] EMBO J 15:1961-1970 – 188 citations).
