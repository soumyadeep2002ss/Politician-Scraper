Research
Cell biology and biophysics

Scientists in this unit use multidisciplinary approaches to investigate the molecular and biophysical mechanisms that enable cells to function.

Developmental biology

Research in the Developmental Biology Unit is focused on understanding the origin, development, and evolution of organisms and their communities.

Directors' research

The Directors' research unit covers thematically distinct research groups, headed by EMBL and EMBO leadership.

Genome biology

The Genome biology unit uses and develops cutting-edge methods to study how the information in our genome is regulated, processed, and utilised, and how its alteration leads to disease.

Structural and computational biology

Scientists in this unit use integrated structural and computational techniques to study biology at scales from molecular structures to organismal communities.

Services and facilities

Research at EMBL is supported by the development of enabling technologies that are made available to the scientific community in its Core facilities, eight of which are located at EMBL Heidelberg. Core facilities provide practical tools and expert advice for life scientists.
