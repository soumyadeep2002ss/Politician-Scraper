If the Albufera is not cared for it will disappear, but its disappearance will not cause 
anything else to happen. There will not be any geological cataclysm; nor any sort of 
catastrophe, or anything like that. Moreover, the physical destiny of the Albufera is that it 
will disappear. The lake, abandoned to itself, with no sort of attacks upon it or any efforts 
to care for it, is irretrievably condemned to disappearance. But this is the fate of any 
historical or artistic monument. Every building, for example, is condemned to 
disappearance, just as the construction of extinguished civilizations disappeared, and just 
as little by little the castles, chapels and monasteries lost in the Spanish geography are 
disappearing, important victims of carelessness, theft, and hooliganism. 
Restoration work is undertaken in order to alleviate this inexorable fate as much as 
possible. This is why any monument or work of economic or cultural interest is object of 
a permanent guarding and conservation that will allow such legacies of our parents to 
pass to our children. There is no explanation, then, for the abandonment and pillage that 
an area of scenic and cultural interest such as the Albufera has undergone. We have a 
responsibility to our descendants that this patrimony is not lost; that the cultural wealth of 
the Albufera, in the broadest sense of the word, passes intact to the generations to come.
