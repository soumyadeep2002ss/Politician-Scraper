From "Selvaggi" to "Moretti"
Giacomo Ghedini
Over 2000 children of subsaharan origin were
which in the 1800s were redeemed by the
slavery and educated in Europe by
Catholic missionaries, with the aim of postponing them in
Africa as "indigenous missionaries". Yet, up
To date, this phenomenon has not almost found
placed in historiography and collective memory.
Forgotten, perhaps, or removed.
Victims of other people's choices, but also protagonists of the
own, the so -called "Moretti" were not simple
satellites orbiting around European missionaries, but
real "history agents". This book is a
first attempt to subtract them on the suburbs of ours
narratives and to return a place and a name to them.
The archives are clear: Afro-European are not
protagonists only of the most recent European history.
