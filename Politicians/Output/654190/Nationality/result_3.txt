Abstract 
Current research has shown that the way that nuclear technology was 
developed in Italy was marked by two specific trends. First, the adoption of 
nuclear technology took place in Italy before it was used by other European 
countries, and second, there was a whole range of initiatives in this sector. 
In this context this PhD looks in detail at the US technology available at the 
time  and  then  analyses  how  and  in  which  specific  forms  Italy  set  up  a 
national nuclear programme, before moving on to a discussion of the results 
of  the  Italian  programme.  By  concentrating  on  Italy’s Società 
elettronucleare  nazionale (SENN)  (National  Nuclear  Electricity  Company)  I 
have been able to analyse these wider questions. The first chapter looks at 
the relationship between Italy and the World Bank using the archives of the 
Banca  d’Italia (the  Italian  national  bank),  the  World  Bank  archives,  and 
secondary literature. It looks at the context in which a nuclear power plant 
was  built  in  the  Italian  South,  on  the  Garigliano  river;  this  investment  is 
also  compared  with  other  investments  by  the  World  Bank  in  Italy.  The 
second  chapter  looks  at  the  forms  of  nuclear  technology available  at  the 
time and the characteristics of the US ‘Atoms for Peace’ programme. The 
aim  of  this  chapter  is  to  draw  out  the  importance  of  propaganda  in 
promoting  technology  which  was  still  linked  to  its  possible  military  use. 
Chapter  3  looks  at  the  situation  in  Italy  at  the  time  of  the  building  of  the 
nuclear power plant, the research applied at the time, and other public and 
private  investments  in  Italy  in  nuclear  power.  This  analysis  is  based  on 
archival  material,  interviews  with  key  figures  from  the time,  newspaper 
articles, secondary literature, and specialised periodicals. Chapter 4 looks at 
the negotiations between the United States Atomic Energy Commission and 
the  Italian  national  bank  over  the  creation  of  a  nuclear  power  station  in 
Garigliano.  This  research  is  based  on  the  archives  of  the  World  Bank  and 
Italy’s national bank, and private archives. Chapter 5 looks at the loans 
which were used to build the plant, and at the beginning of its construction. 
Chapter 6 takes the story on to the construction, activity, and closure of the 
plant. Finally, Chapter 7 shows how nuclear energy was represented in the 
Italian newspapers.
