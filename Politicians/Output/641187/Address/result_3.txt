How is a local entity organized?

The Government and the administration of the municipalities (unless they work in an open council regime) correspond to the City Council, composed of the mayor and the councilors, whose number is variable depending on the population. For its part, the Government and Administration of the Province correspond to the Diputación, except in the Uniprovincial Autonomous Communities, in which it corresponds to the Government of the Autonomous Community; in the Balearic Islands, which are replaced by the island advice; and in the Canary Islands, for the Cabildos.

The Government and the Municipal Administration, according to the LRBRL, after the reform introduced by Law 57/2003, corresponds to the City Council, composed of the mayor and the councilors, except the municipalities under the open council regime.

The mayor, the deputy mayor and the plenary exist in all municipalities.

The deputy mayor are appointed by the mayor among the members of the Local Government Board and replace that, by the order of their appointment, in cases of vacancy, absence or illness.

The mayor is elected by the councilors, who in turn are elected by universal suffrage, or directly by the neighbors (open council).

The plenary is made up of all the councilors and chaired by the mayor.

The Local Government Board will exist in all municipalities of population exceeding 5,000 inhabitants and, when it is remembered, also in those of less than 5,000 inhabitants.

The Special Commission of Suggestions and Claims will exist in all municipalities of large population, as well as in those others in which it is remembered.

The Special Accounts Commission, constituted by councilors of the different political groups that are part of the Corporation, will exist in all municipalities and will report on the annual accounts before its submission to the plenary.

There may also be organs for the study, report or consultation of the issues submitted to the plenary decision, as well as for the monitoring of the mayor's management, the Local Government Board and the councilors who hold delegations.

The Government and the Provincial Administration (in those territories that have the Provincial Council) responds to the rules that appear below.

The president, the vice presidents, the Governing and Plenary Board exist in all the deputations.

The Plenary, the highest body of the province, is constituted by the President and the deputies, in number established by Organic Law 5/1985, of June 19, of the General Electoral Regime. The deputies must gather the status of councilors in the municipalities of the respective province, being their indirect election.

They will also exist in all the organs organs that have as its object the study, report or consultation of the issues that must be submitted to the Plenary decision, as well as the monitoring of the management of the President, the Governing Board and of the Deputies who have delegations, without prejudice to the control powers corresponding to the plenary.

All the members of the Diputación have the right to participate in these bodies, in proportion to the number of deputies that youngan in the plenary.

The rest of the complementary bodies of the above are established and regulated by the deputations themselves, although the laws of the autonomous communities on local regime may establish a complementary organization.

The deputations of Álava, Guipúzcoa and Vizcaya retain their peculiar regime, within the framework of the Autonomous Community of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country. The Uniprovincial Autonomous Communities and the Foral of Navarra assume the powers, means and resources that correspond in the ordinary regime to the provincial deputations, except the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands, which has the island councils.

The rest of the local entities will have the governing bodies that determine the statutes or laws of the autonomous communities or the LRBRL itself.
