Abstract 
 
 
The research explores the production of feminist spaces as safer spaces in urban contexts. How do 
feminist movements imagine, produce and preserve safer spaces? To search for an answer, I engaged 
with participatory action research (PAR) and constructivist grounded theory method (CGTM). In the 
cities of Rome and Madrid, that share general socio-economic, cultural and political features (Kantola 
and Lombardo 2017), feminist movements, as well, share similar frames, claims, and repertoires of 
actions. In each city, I selected three types of feminist spaces: women’s houses and/or spaces of 
equality  (Casa  Internazionale  delle  donne  in  Rome  and  Espacios  de  Igualdad  in  Madrid); 
longstanding feminist spaces which host a multiplicity of projects and direct social action (Lucha Y 
Siesta  in  Rome  and  Eskalera  Karakola  in  Madrid);  radical  transfeminist,  lesbian,  and  queer 
occupations (the space of Cagne Sciolte in Rome and Plataforma Encuentros Bolleros in Madrid).   
By searching for the meaning of safety, CGTM drove me to the work on affect and emotions that 
takes place within feminist spaces. Affects, as gradients of intensity and vital forces, work as 1) a 
channel  of  mediation  between  cognition  and  bodies;  2)  a  tool  for  political  elaboration;  3)  a 
competence in action. The confidence with inner feelings (that is usually considered unpolitical) 
makes people feel comfortable and at ease. People are not trapped in rituals of interaction and the 
performance of social encounters. Emotions can be manifested, elaborated on, transformed into action 
(Gould 2009). Affects do not enrich or empower political action, but they are the very matter of it 
(Massumi 2015). The capacity to name, negotiate and reverberate affects has transformative effects 
(Ahmed 2006), both at the individual and collective level. The work on collective affects allows 
feminist spaces to pursue their search for social change, with continuity (Taylor 1989, Whittier 1995), 
contention (McAdam, Tarrow and Tilly 2001), and innovation (Staggenborg 1989, 1995).  
In the empirical analysis, I engage with the concept of affects at three levels. At the macro level, by 
investigating how spaces relate with the structure of economic models and institutions, by performing 
alternative  models  and  dealing  with  national,  local  and  collective  actors.  At  the  meso  level,  by 
exploring the mobilisation of affects in collective action. At the micro level of actors, by looking at 
how individual mobilisation process and long-term political participation are bound up with affects.  
By drawing on affect theory, social movement studies and feminist theory, the research argues that 
the work on affect and emotions within feminist spaces has transformative effects, by increasing the 
potential for collective action.

The research is indebted to many people that nourished its path. Words cannot say enough about the 
emotional, political, and academic community that surrounded my journey over the past four years.  
 
Donatella della Porta, above all, believed in and supported this project from the very beginning. She 
always encouraged me to take a step forward. I am grateful for her curiosity in meeting my confusion 
and insights. She always helped me to find my way back. 
Alice Mattoni brought me to constructivist grounded theory and participatory action research. She 
taught me that doing research is a rigorous work and an ethical duty that we owe to ourselves, the 
participants, and the academic community. I thank her for when, in the first year, she told me that she 
was looking forward to the findings of the research and to walking by my side. 
Following a presentation of the project, Marco Deseriis sent me an email that allowed me to click on 
Affect Theory, and to reach the step of theoretical abstraction I was struggling for at the time.  
Lorenzo  Bosi  has  generously  read  and  re-read  my  drafts.  To  him  and  to  the  entire  COSMOS 
community  goes  my  thanks  for  nourishing  these  years  of  training  and  opening  my  mind  with 
countless stimuli, inspirations, and new perspectives. 
I am grateful to all the people who, during conferences, panels, workshops, courses, presentations, 
summer schools, and email exchanges have discussed my work or gave suggestions, allowing me to 
find my way in the midst of entropy: Lorenzo Zamponi, Manuela Caiani, Manuela Moschella, Chiara 
Milan, Marco Deseriis, Daniela Chironi, Elena Pavan, Rossella Ciccia, Måns Robert Lundstedt, Fred 
Paxton, Emanuela Lombardo, Beatrice Gusmano, Marianne Blidon, Maria Rodó de Zárate, Verta

Bonanno, Marco la Rocca, Antonia Caruso, Clotilde Barbarulli, Michela Cicculli, Simona Ammerata, 
Vincenza Pellegrino, Giulia Rodeschini, Elia Arfini.  
I am grateful to all the feminist scholars and movements who have disclosed the world of knowledge 
and change for over a decade, continuing to fuel the process through which this research has taken 
shape.  
Thank you to Teresa di Martino, Roberta Paoletti, Federica Castelli, Patrizia Cacioli, Paola Masi, 
Noemi Ciarniello, the editorial board of DWF, for bringing me to explore the world through a feminist 
standpoint, within and beyond the research.

This journey would not have been the same without the community of peers who have made academia 
a place of affection, through which to navigate the troubles, with irony and joy. They enhanced my 
life far beyond those four walls. I am especially grateful to Joana Hofstetter - my “partner in crime'', 
Karlo Kralij who surrounded the last most strenuous months of writing with love and unwavering 
support,  Jacopo  Custodi  for  often  restoring  lucidity  in  moments  of  disorientation,  and Tobias 
Reinhardt,  Alessandra  Lo  Piccolo,  Anastasia  Barone,  Angela  Adami,  Georgos  Venizelos, Stella 
Christou. 
Anna Lavizzari inspired me to be authentic, and thus bring authenticity to the research process. Her 
capacity to see my true self brought me back to the meaning of the thesis every time I got lost. 
Francesca Feo supported the research process with the rigour of her perspective and with her unique 
warmth. The boundless heart of both has very often been a home from which to depart, and to which 
to always return. 
Marta Capesciotti has given me the gift of her presence in my life. The hours I spent discussing the 
meaning of the thesis with her gave me the chance to mirror myself in her sharp intelligence, her 
emotional sensitivity, and her ability to synthesise from chaos. She was the first person to whom I 
timidly proposed the real contribution of the thesis, and who, by reacting enthusiastically, created the 
conditions for me to believe it, too.  
To Chiara Tarantino, who taught me the adaptive function of emotions and how to use them, my 
sincere thanks.  
Sara Galli worked tirelessly on the proof-reading of the thesis. Without her, the manuscript would 
not be the same. 
Many homes between Florence, Sassari, Rome, and Madrid have hosted my late nights, writing days, 
coffee breaks, daily rituals. In the precariousness of a life in perpetual motion, I am grateful to all 
those who have made a home, even for a day. For putting up with the bad moods, the moments of 
unmotivated joy and equally unmotivated crying, for the silences and the laughter, I thank Dinda, 
Giusi, Lalla, Marta C., Marta L., Federico, Daniela, Cristiana, Karlo, Ophelia, Juana.  
Many families, as well, have made the journey worth it. My blood family is the space where I learnt 
about the potential of action that comes from love. I am grateful to my mom and dad for allowing me 
to doggedly search for myself. To Siria, because everything I can understand and transform is only 
by  her  side.  To  Maria  Luisa,  Marco,  Mabi,  Marta,  Lidia,  for  being  my  family  of  choice, that 
overcomes the years and distances. 
To Giusi, for her patience, care, and courage. For lovingly accompanying me these years. For buying 
a chair when I did not know how to stand anymore. For reading every article, every draft, every 
chapter.  For  talking  to  me  about  the  circle  and  for  believing  in  the  revolutionary  power  of 

6 
 
relationships between women*. For teaching me to live in possibility. Per essere la mia compagna, 
ma prima di tutto, una compagna.  
To my community of comrades, friends and sisters goes my heartfelt gratitude. With you in the last 
ten years we cultivated the art of joy, anger, conflict, and loss. To me, there is no way to experience 
and understand the surroundings except with your loving bond. In particular, I thank the Fuxia Block, 
the assembly of Non Una di Meno - Padova and Florence, the space of the Cagne Sciolte, the House 
of Women Lucha Y Siesta. Among them, the love of Pat, Marghe, Dinda, Giuggi, Lalla, Marta, Bea, 
Serena, Cami, Antonina, Carla, Nadia, Madda, Fra, Isa, Ale A., Teresa, Ale C., Angela, Clara, Jula, 
Zoe, Pao, Chiara, Vale, MG, Clotilde, Anna, Francesca, Alina, Giulia, Noemi, Marta, Mary, Jane has 
always brought new light to the road.  
 
My deepest gratitude goes to all the women, trans, and non-binary people who stubbornly enliven 
feminist spaces. For accepting the challenge of the encounter, which made the journey of this research 
worthwhile, and above all possible.

Perhaps we truly encounter the political only when we feel.  
(Staiger 2010: 4)  
 
 
This is a research about the body and cognition, on affects as gradient of intensity and forces of 
encounter, on the sensations that bind us to other people, to spaces, to objects, and on how these 
intensities contain a potential for collective action that has yet to be investigated.  
It happened to be me writing, in the first person. However, the premises, the questions, the path, the 
methods, the sense, the orientation, the findings of this research are the result of a process with 
participants
1
 involved in several feminist spaces in Rome and Madrid. They have generously and 
passionately lent their experience to this project. Although filtered through the writer, the whole 
process  will  try  to  convey  even  just  an  intuition  of  the  richness  that  the  relationship  with  the 
participants has generated. The affective grid of participants is the infrastructure and sound of this 
research.  
Several years ago I was returning from a meeting in a feminist space in Rome. As I was leaving, 
sitting in the underground, I seemed to perceive an ambivalence. On the one hand, the space-time of 
the meeting surrounded me with a feeling of warmth. On the other hand, in the underground, once I 
left the space, I felt cold. The political discussion that took place in the space had, for me, connected 
with feelings of warmth, burst with potential. Leaving that feeling and returning to the urban space 
had  made  me  perceive  a  discrepancy,  through  an  indefinite,  nonconscious  and  non-linguistic 
sensation. The ambivalence of these bodily and cognitive sensations, which I would later call affect, 
represented an initial moment of questioning. From that moment on, I began to reflect more and more 
insistently about the reason for that political momentum bound up with sensations. Then, that puzzle 
was translated into a number of research questions that formed the first step of this doctoral research.  
With this episode, I would like to situate the manuscript. Like any research, this one also stems from 
an individual situated experience, concerning my biographical trajectory, and the things that, through 
 
1
 Normally, in social movement studies, we are used to refer to actors as activists. Since the beginning of the fieldwork, 
however, the concept of "activist" has been strongly challenged by the people involved. In fact, activism seems to refer 
to a circumscribed activity in the day, or in life, in which one is actively committed to a cause. Instead, the people involved 
in the spaces claim an idea of political engagement as whole-life involvement, and interpenetration between the personal 
and the political. Therefore, we rather opted for the word "participants" in the manuscript as participants of feminist 
spaces and participants in the research.

my experience, I perceived as a puzzle to investigate. From there on, a participatory research began, 
that intensively involved three feminist spaces in the city of Rome, and – with many limitations 
related to the outbreak of the pandemic – three spaces in the city of Madrid. The whole research was 
constructed in a precarious balance between myself and the relationship with the participants in the 
research, in an attempt to make explicit a relationship – also – of power, which however stubbornly 
attempted to proceed through reciprocity, listening and caring.  
The second element of this episode is the derivation of a cognitive process from the body and affect. 
The feelings of warmth/coldness were translated into research questions investigating whether and 
how feminist spaces imagine, produce and preserve safe spaces. As well as the trigger for the research, 
the  research  itself  was  shaped  by  a  bodily  and  affective  ethnographic  approach,  in  which  the 
participants' ability to tell their stories and my chance to understand them came through the decoding 
of the forces of encounter.  
Last, but not least, the episode is telling of a close correlation between the forms of politics and those 
of feeling, which is typical of the feminist movement. It is not easy to go through what Grosz calls 
“the imperceptibility” (2004). Yet, in that opaque substance, that shadowy zone in which various 
intensities come alive and meet, are deposited meanings relevant to our understanding of collective 
action and political phenomena.  
This research does not set out to succeed. More humbly, the research tries to propose some insights 
into the ambivalence of our feeling in relation to the political, and how feeling is the repository of 
much more potential than we are used to believing.  
For this reason, the research does not propose a binary, stable, and finite analysis of safe spaces. 
Rather, what will emerge are structures of feelings, concatenations of bodies, blurred zones between 
inside and outside, in which the relational dimension of affect enhances the capacity for political 
action.

Part I: Setting the Stage 
 
 
 
1. Introduction: Feminism, Affect and Safer Spaces  
 
 
1.1 Introduction 
 
 
There's a space within the collective where each of us can say how we are... there's a space for 
how you're feeling, as well as being political... because we're all aware that how you're feeling 
affects what you say and what you do in a collective. And so it doesn't make sense not to give 
space to that stuff there. In any case, the consequences of that stuff are within your collective. 
Because each one of us can live more or less happy moments, can live more or less beautiful 
sensations and that stuff brings it back into our political action, puts it back into circulation with 
all the others. Therefore, rather than suffering it passively, we have decided to give it space in the 
collective because at least we choose to manage that stuff. We are aware of it and we choose to 
manage it together. [...] It's something that is also subject to a delicate balance. [...] Opening the 
door for emotionality and feeling for people to sit in meetings is a beautiful and powerful thing, 
giving you so much, building so much, in the same way it can be a way that stacks, blocks, and 
takes over from other people's feeling. (III6, CS, 35) 
 
It's  an  acquisition  of...  I  don't  know,  maybe  competence  in  being  in  the  world.  Certainly  the 
closeness of my comrades always helps me. But I realise it's something I carry around a lot, even 
when I'm alone. And it's a very pacifying feeling. It pacifies me a lot. And in fact I wrote that I 
don't remember the last time I didn't feel safe. I think it's kind of the fruit of a journey. [...] I spent 
many years of my life with anger, strong anxiety. Even just leaving the house. Because I had well 
internalised what it was like to go out and not know how you were going to get back and if you 
were going to get back. A little bit because you're a woman, a little bit because you're a lesbian, 
a little bit because people are looking at you anyway, and Rome is a strange city, and so many 
times it's given me proof of how violent it can be. And at a certain point it's like I've made my 
peace with it, it's like that anxiety and that fear has kind of disappeared. And a great dignity has 
arisen to live my life as it is. (Focus Group III, CS) 
 
These two quotes are suffused with the expression of affective intensity, of sensations, of emotional 
states. These are just two among the many conversations, statements, and small talk in which this 
vocabulary emerged during the fieldwork. Slowly, the affective grid through which the participants 
express themselves, construct their sense of self, make meaning of the things they experience, and 
process political action seemed to me to be increasingly unattainable. I felt the need to be attached to 
their words through the mediation of the affect they used. In this way, affect and emotions began to 
emerge as a channel for understanding the production of feminist spaces.  
As the quotes show, affect emerges as mediation between cognition and body. The need to take charge 
of emotions arises from perceptions experienced daily with the body, which, through sharing in a 
collective context, can become tools for understanding oneself, and therefore for transformation. In 

15 
 
this sense, affect is also an instrument of political elaboration: through the filter of affect it is possible 
to understand, in more general terms, the social and cultural structures that produce certain emotions 
and that have individual consequences on each subject. This exercise is not purely reflexive, but leads 
to a third function of affect, which is to become a competence for collective action. In the work of 
naming, giving meaning, transforming affects and making them the terrain for political elaboration, 
feminist spaces also construct their own strategies, repertoires of action, and interaction with the 
outside world. This indicates that emotions are not only used strategically, but represent a choice of 
mediation with the social world, a political tool that changes the filter through which to understand, 
and therefore transform, reality. It is not by chance that the second quotation reports this process, 
from  a  negative affective  intensity  born  of  the  perception  of  a  discrepancy  between  one's  own 
existence and a social context that rejects or stigmatises that existence, to the transformation of the 
affect into potential. The changes of the self opens up to "a pacification," the development of positive 
feelings that expand the perception of the self and the ability to act in the world. This transformation 
is never individual, but is conveyed by collective action, and reverberates in collective action.  
Yet, the research had started from the puzzling concept of safe space. The use of the term “safe space” 
recurs in the narrative of contemporary feminist movements. This term alludes to many meanings, 
which in reiteration become less clear, and more easily the object of conflict. In general terms, the 
need for safer spaces emerges from the understanding of social reality as ordered through gender 
norms that produce subalternity, inequality, and violence. The effects of this gender order influence 
all spheres of life: from interpersonal relations to work and public space. The perception of living in 
a very unsafe social context for those who are distributed along the axis of gender, race, class, age, 
and sexuality in a non-hegemonic position leads to the emergence of a desire to build different, safer 
places.  These  spaces  can  be  virtual,  communal,  but  also  physical.  Spaces  in  which  a  certain 
composition of subjectivities experiences more liveable living conditions that are supposed to be safe 
from misogyny, violence, abuse, mistreatment, violation of consent, racism, ableism, prevarication. 
This, in a nutshell, is normally what the reference to safe spaces alludes to. 
With reference to the recurrent use of this concept, and the range of meanings to which it alludes, this 
research elaborates on a question:  
If, how, and why do feminist movements imagine, produce and preserve safe spaces? 
This question gave rise to a participatory research involving six feminist spaces between Rome and 
Madrid, and dozens of participants active in the spaces. While it is true that safe spaces refer to many 
possible dimensions – virtual, community, etc. – in this case the choice to explore physical spaces 
was consistent with the research questions and the desire to observe the material determinants to 
which the concept of safe space is anchored.  The opening up of women's spaces in urban contexts is 

16 
 
a constant of the feminist movement. Examples include the gymnasium where Edith Garrud trained 
suffragists in ju-jitsu in the early 20
th
 century, or the Hull-House in Chicago where Jane Addams 
founded the first settlement house run entirely by women. The opening up of physical spaces has 
historically allowed for the consolidation of the feminist movement's claims and, on the other hand, 
for  the  active  production  of  social  change,  through  every-day  politics,  direct  social  action,  and 
consciousness-raising (Spain 2016). The possibility of leaving the home to take part in political space 
has been a vehicle of emancipation and liberation for generations of women (Rupp and Taylor 1989). 
For these reasons, the research question on safe spaces led me to select feminist spaces as cases from 
the outset. The concreteness of the spaces, with an address, four walls, and a continuity of political 
action, allowed for a deep and daily exploration of interactions, processes of attribution of meaning, 
and political elaboration. Feminist spaces also made it possible to hold together several levels of 
analysis related to social transformation, in relation to context, urban space, structure. 
The analysis was carried out through the constructivist grounded theory method (CGTM): therefore, 
in the long-lasting ethnographic process of participatory and non-participatory analysis, concepts and 
interpretations multiplied. The topic itself seemed to change: from safe spaces to the understanding 
of  the  infrastructure  of  affect  and  emotions  that stimulates,  supports,  feeds,  and  encourages  the 
collective action of feminist spaces.  
The words of the participants, their gestures, their interactions, their decision-making processes, are 
constantly intertwined with an affective lexicon, a nonconscious and non-linguistic intensity. The 
pervasiveness  of  affects  and  emotions  in  the  participants'  way  of  constructing  their  self,  their 
interpersonal  relations,  political  elaboration,  and  interaction  with  the  outside  world  guided  the 
analysis towards an increasing focus on this dimension. CGTM assumes that it is fieldwork that 
inductively produces new insights into social phenomena. So, I let the field guide the analysis towards 
what recurred most insistently. 
In recounting their own lives, the participants chose the access point of emotions and body states in 
comparison  with  a  social  world  still  strongly  segregated  by  gender.  As  Nancy  Whittier  argues, 
feminist movements have been historically engaged with politicking emotions: “the feminist anti-
rape  movement  legitimized  women’s  claims  against  male  violence,  politicized  private  sexual 
experiences, [...] constructed a politicized discourse of trauma that stressed women’s victimization 
due to violence, [...] and the importance of individual and collective recovery and resistance” (2001: 
238). In the everyday of spaces, interactions took place through bodies: hugs and caresses, the habit 
of seeking contact with other participants, the choice of communicating with the body where verbal 
language does not reach. Lots of tears, lots of laughter, some screaming. Through these and many 
other intensities, the infrastructure of affect began to emerge. From the outset, the affective dimension 

17 
 
emerged as being closely linked to the material dimension. On the one hand, in the sense of mediation 
between body and cognition. On the other, in the sense of mediation with structure: with the economic 
model,  the  institutional  set-up,  social  norms.  Why  is  it  relevant  to  pay  attention  to  affects  and 
emotions in relation to social movements? What do emotion and affect allow to do? What do they 
add to our understanding of collective action?   
In the next sections, I will begin to outline the concepts and reflections on which the analysis of 
feminist spaces was developed. First, in relation to affect, capitalism, and democracy. Second, in 
relation to what we mean by affect, emotions, and feelings in reference to collective action. Finally, 
in relation to the relationship between affect and the spatial dimension.  
 
 
1.2 Affect, Capitalism and Democracy  
 
While it is true that human beings are not always oriented by rationality or strategic action, they are 
constantly moved by various affective, emotional, and passionate intensities. As long as we are alive, 
we constantly feel, perceive. We affect and are affected by.  
The history of Western thought has developed around the theorisation of a rational, strategically 
oriented,  independent  subject  (Cerulo  2018,  Pulcini  2020).  Emotions,  from  Descartes  and  Kant 
onwards, have been considered an obstacle to the cognitive realisation of the subject, an irrational 
and unpredictable element that endangers the order of society, as theories of collective behaviour 
developed (Le Bon 2002, Gould 2010). Building on the sociology of emotions, feminist theory, and 
recent developments in the study of social movements, this research attempts to focus on the social 
and political function performed by affects in relation to collective action. Feminist spaces represent 
a privileged place in which to observe not only how affects operate, but also how affects become a 
political  matter  of  collective  work,  elaboration,  and  strategic  action.  Emotions,  in  fact,  have  an 
adaptive function with respect to subjects. They develop at a biological level, but above all at a social 
and cultural level, assigning a certain response to certain stimuli, which often allows survival itself. 
However, this aspect is often relegated to the intimate sphere, dismissed in public life, and removed 
from the biographical construction of subjects. Subjects are required to be rational, high-performing, 
and productive in a neo-liberal economic and social system in which everyone is worth what they 
produce. The feminist movement has historically inverted this paradigm, revealing in the affects and 
emotions (in the personal) the deep political root (Taylor 1995, Whittier 2001). In this sense, the work 
on affects is a political work that requires the transformation of the individual, the transformation of 
social relations, and the transformation of symbols, values, and assumptions on which the system of 
production is based. 

18 
 
There is a long history of separation between the sphere of affects and passions and that of rational 
calculation. The genesis of the rational social actor is intertwined with the genesis of capitalism. As 
Albert Hirschman argues in his study of the political arguments in favour of capitalism before its 
triumph (1977), the history of the separation of passions and interests begins in the Renaissance 
period. In that phase, multiple needs emerged: the creation of norms of conduct for individuals, the 
need to improve the art of government, and thus the theories of the state. Trade and gain, which up 
until then had been regarded as a form of greed and love of profit, changed hands in history for ideas, 
coming to be a counterweight in the regulation of the Prince's rule. Progressively, passions such as 
lust for power, arrogance, haughtiness, seemed to be able to be regulated and tempered by self-
interest. Encouraging individuals to cultivate their own interests allowed them, on the one hand, to 
escape from the dangerous drift of passions, and on the other to curb the rule of the State. In this 
sense,  the  emerging  capitalist  model  is  based  on  a  clear  separation  between  interest,  rational 
calculation, and passions and affect. Cut off from both the economic model and the forms of politics, 
affects are dangerous aspects of the human soul that need to be kept at bay. Even as the distortions of 
capitalism  become  more  apparent,  the  uprisings  and  revolts  against  the  economic  model  are 
interpreted through the negative lens of passions, that disrupt and endanger the balance of power 
between the economic and political systems.  
To this interpretation of the birth of capitalism, feminist theory added a relevant item. The birth of 
capitalism is marked by the passion/interest dualism. The construction of meanings about the world 
through binary categories has a long history: opposite poles always refer to dichotomous symbolic 
universes  (Cavarero  1995,  Tola  2016,  Scott  2011,  Spivak  1999).  Passions,  nature,  emotions, 
domestic, private, vulnerability, irrationality, backwardness, body, on the one hand. Interests, culture, 
cognition, public, strength, rationality, courage, mind, politics, progress, and economy on the other. 
The first pole always relates to the production of the female gender, the second symbolic universe to 
the production of the male gender. Through the consolidation of these dichotomies, the social and 
economic structure has taken shape, and with it the reiteration of gender codes.  
So what does it mean to claim the use of the affects, their political relevance, for those who have 
always  been  made  subordinate  through  them?  How  can  women,  lesbians,  trans,  and  non-binary 
people, who have always been relegated to the irrational sphere of passions, claim a political use for 
them, and through this work increase the potential for political action?  
These  elements  make  it  clear  to  what  extent  the  use  of  affects  by  feminist  spaces  produces 
consequences that affect the codes of the economic model on the one hand, and the codes of the 
democratic model on the other. If both spheres – capitalism and democracy – are the product of a 
history  of  ideas  that  has  separated  affect  and  emotion  from  the  system  of  production  and  the 

19 
 
management of public affairs, introducing affect and emotion into the interaction with these models 
challenges the very codes within which the interaction is envisaged.  
However, it is appropriate to remind that in the contemporary world, both capitalism and democracy 
have  found  ways  to  profit  from  emotions.  As  Hochschild  (1979)  explains  by  analysing  flight 
attendants  employed  by  an  airline  company,  workers  are demanded an  emotional  work  that  is 
inherently part of their work. The capture and exploitation of emotions is part of the changes in the 
capitalist economic model, to which social movements have reacted by changing their repertoires of 
action, for example through the “smile strike” (Karlsson 2012, Morini 2010).  
Emotions are continuously mobilised in the construction of the idea of nationhood, citizenship, and 
democracy, often from the point of view of excluding those who are considered others. As Sara 
Ahmed explains: 
It  is  the  emotional  reading  of  hate  that  works  to  bind  the  imagined  white subject  and  nation 
together. The average white man feels “fear and loathing”; the white housewife, “repulsion and 
anger”; the white workingman, “curses”; the white Christian farmer, “rage.” The passion of these 
negative  attachments  to  others  is  redefined simultaneously  as  a  positive  attachment  to  the 
imagined subjects brought together through the repetition of the signifier, “white.” It is the love 
of  white,  or  those  recognizable  as  white,  that  supposedly  explains  this  shared  “communal” 
visceral response of hate. Together we hate, and this hate is what makes us together. (2004: 118) 
 
The symbolic repertoire of the right-wing and anti-gender groups makes extensive reference to the 
emotional dimension to mobilise consensus around their claims. Emotions, thus, are powerful tools 
in contemporary society to orient consensus, and to circulate power.  
The choice of conscious work on affect by feminist spaces is therefore a slippery slope. On the one 
hand, because it draws on a repertoire of codes consubstantial to the social production of women's 
subalternity. On the other hand, because it is in the field of emotions that contemporary challenges to 
social justice are played out. Around these ambivalences, the research will try to reconstruct the 
processes of attribution of meaning and the uses that the participants make of affection and emotions, 
identifying the limits and potentials of such work.  
 
1.3 Affect, Emotions, Passions and Feelings  
  
The question is not necessarily whether or not an affective movement is experienced consciously or 
unconsciously by the subject but how affective processes have political effects. What matters is what the 
emotional, however defined, do. (Åhäll 2018: 43) 
 
The research began by interrogating the feeling of safety in feminist spaces, and ended up exploring 
the meaning of affect. This fact is less surprising than it seems, as the chapters to come will try to 
disentangle. I came to affects and emotions by following the vocabulary and style of interaction of 

20 
 
the  participants.  The  progress  of  their  discussions,  the  way  they  recounted  and  reasoned  about 
themselves,  their  political  elaboration,  were  suffused  with  much  more  than  strategic-rational 
calculation. I ventured into the skein of intensities shaping the surfaces of bodies, spaces, objects, and 
even the relationship to me as a researcher. There emerged affect, emotions, passions, and feelings. 
Of this complex matter, it is necessary to proceed to some specifications. Although in the empirical 
world there is never a clearly identifiable separation, trying to delineate the differences supports a 
more organic account of the phenomenon.  
Why is the research primarily concerned with the function of affect?  
 
Affect as Bodily Capacity and Relational Intensity  
The concept of affect has distant roots in Spinoza's thought. According to the philosopher, human 
beings are moved in their presence in the world by a desire, an appetite, a vital tension. This desire 
that drives us to action and self-preservation represents the very essence of human beings. Human 
beings relate to the world through this desire, which puts them in relation to other human beings, to 
objects, to the natural world. In this sense, affect signals the tension emanating from a body, what a 
body can do, but also immediately a relational dimension, a space of interaction. Affect, therefore, is 
not based on the individual, but is the gradient of intensity, the mode of encounter that binds us to 
others and to things. Affect is the life force that exposes a body to the potential for action, or being 
acted upon. In this sense, affect alludes to the field of power, in the sense that through affects flows 
the possibility of increasing the capacity for action, or decreasing it. Affects can be of a different 
nature:  when  aware  of  the  conditions  that  cause  them,  they  are  actions;  when  unconscious,  and 
therefore passive, they are passions. Knowledge of the causes that cause the affects, and therefore 
changes in intensity, produces an increase in our ability to act, and therefore in our power. Matter and 
thought are not separate, but belong to the same substance, to that vital force that is the potential for 
action of a body and of bodies in relation to each other. 
This theoretical framework, that disrupts the traditional dichotomies of reason and passion, body and 
mind on which the social sciences were built upon, was then recovered and built on by the affective 
turn (Gregg and Seigworth 2010). Thanks to the insights of Deleuze and Guattari, and their translator 
Brian Massumi (2015), feminist neo-materialism, and interest in the field of cultural studies, the 
concept of affect was included the interpretation of contemporary social contexts. This turn in the 
social sciences allows to understand the political use of what Spinoza defined as affect. Affect, in this 
key, refers to the idea of having an effect on something or someone, or being affected by something 
or someone. It is, therefore, a concept that links what the body and the mind express to the relational 

21 
 
dimension, to interaction. In one of the first attempt to map out the debate on the affective turn, Gregg 
and Seighworth define affect as follows:  
affect is found in those intensities that pass body to body (human, nonhuman, part-body, and 
otherwise), in those resonances that circulate about, between, and sometimes stick to bodies and 
worlds,  and  in  the  very  passages  or  variations  between  these  intensities  and  resonances 
themselves. Affect, at its most anthropomorphic, is the name we give to those forces—visceral 
forces  beneath,  alongside,  or  generally  other  than  conscious  knowing,  vital  forces  insisting 
beyond emotion—that can serve to drive us toward movement, toward thought and extension, 
that  can  likewise  suspend  us  (as  if  in  neutral)  across  a  barely  registering  accretion  of  force-
relations, or that can even leave us overwhelmed by the world’s apparent intractability. Indeed, 
affect is persistent proof of a body’s never less than ongoing immersion in and among the world’s 
obstinacies and rhythms, its refusals as much as its invitations (Gregg and Seigworth 2010: 1).  
In the field of social movement studies Deborah B. Gould was one of the most important scholars to 
develop the concept, in reference to Act Up's fight against AIDS (2009, 2010).  
 
E-motion: Moving Forwards and Towards 
Social  movements  studies  have  always  engaged  with  emotions  as  a  source  of  understanding  of 
collective action. By overcoming the interpretation of collective behaviour theorists (Le Bon 2001, 
Smelser 1963), and an overly structuralist approach to social movements (Tarrow 1994, McAdam, 
McCarthy and Zald 1996, Kriesi 1996), scholars turned their attention to the role that emotions have 
in strengthening, coalescing, and enhancing collective action: “emotions can be seen as an aspect of 
all social  action  and  social  relations”  (Goodwin,  Jasper  and  Polletta  2001:  9).  On  one  hand,  a 
structuralist approach heavily relies on resources, structures, and organisation; on the other hand, 
constructivist approaches focus on frames, meanings, and emotions. As Goodwin and Jasper (2004) 
argue, for much too long this has also been a gendered dividing line – with women mainly engaged 
in the field of culture and emotions. With an edited volume on rethinking social movements, the 
scholars also tried to bridge and to nuance over simplistic disputes between the two, by claiming for 
a reconciliation between structure and emotions. Political process theory failed in a structural biased 
analysis of the environment where social movements develop, by focusing on purely rational social 
actors. However, is this analysis of emotions enough? How does the concept of emotions differ from 
the concept of affect? 
In her work, Gould extensively builds on these research questions. To her, emotions, when taken into 
account in social movement studies – and by political process theorists – risk to be taken into account 
solely according to their strategic use, for example through activists’ attempt to mobilise people into 
the  movement  (Gould  2004).  Instead,  “emotions  are  a  component  of  all  interpretive  processes, 
affecting, for example, how external opportunities and threats are understood and responded to, how 
resources are allocated, why a collective action frame succeeds or fails. Emotions are integral to a 
person's sense of herself and to her political subjectivity. Emotions shape people's notions of what is 

22 
 
politically possible and desirable” (2004: 162). Moreover, as Whittier points out with reference to 
movements against child sexual abuse (2001, 2009), emotions can be transformed through collective 
action and channeled into action.   
According to these interpretations, we can see the concept of emotions emerging, breaking away from 
that of affect. The flourishing tradition of the sociology of emotions interpreted emotions as a product 
of culture and society. The rise and display of certain emotions is produced by an infrastructure of 
meanings, codes, and political orientation (Simmel 1994, Hochschild 1990, Collins 2004, Reddy 
1997, 2000, Ahmed 2004). There is an “emotion culture” (Gordon 1989) that produces, in certain 
situations, the expectation of certain emotional reactions, and therefore the “rules” of expressing 
emotions (Hochschild 1979, 1983, 1990). However, this infrastructure is neither impermeable nor 
all-encompassing, and it is no coincidence that people experience “outlaw emotions” (Jaggar 1989) 
that are normally considered inappropriate or unacceptable.  
Affect are “nonconscious and unnamed, but nevertheless registered, experiences of bodily energy and 
intensity that arise in response to stimuli impinging on the body,” while emotions describe “what of 
affect—what of the potential of bodily intensities—gets actualized or concretized in the flow of 
living” (Gould 2010: 19-20). By building on Massumi’s assumptions (2015), Gould conceptualises 
emotions as the way affect comes to be codified, named, inscripted into conventional expression. The 
root of the word e-motion alludes to moving out and towards, formalising therefore, a certain portion 
of  meaning  about  what  we  feel.  Emotions  are  affects  filtered  by  culture,  by  our  schemes  of 
interpretation, our language, our habits. To make sense of an affect and to communicate it to the 
others,  we  build names  and  meanings,  expressions,  and  codes.  This  meaning-making  process  is 
heavily related to our cultural context, and so we make sense of an affect according to a certain 
structure of available significances. “An emotion, in other words, brings a vague bodily intensity or 
sensation into the realm of cultural meanings and normativity, systems of signification that structure 
our very feelings” (Gould 2010: 21). While affect entails the enormous potential for action of a body, 
emotions “capture” portions of affect into cultural codified objects, through the partial inhibition of 
that potential. In the ongoing flow of affective intensities with regard to the surrounding, something 
gets actualised in the form of emotions: as such, affect produces the ground for codifying, but also to 
feel, emotions. In this mechanism of capture and actualisation lies the puzzle of the research questions 
that orient this project. While it is true that we are perpetually immersed in affecting and being 
affected by, and that social movements have also been studied through the strategic use of emotions, 
there is still a lack of adequate account of how some movements, such as the feminist movement, 
develop  cognitive  and  bodily  liberation,  political  elaboration,  and  capacity  for  action from their 
conscious  work  on  affect  and  emotions.  Awareness  of  the  forces  of  the  encounter,  beyond  the 

23 
 
linguistic, conscious, and determined level, allows feminist spaces to open up a field of potential for 
action that would otherwise be inaccessible. In the discrepancy between the emotional coding and the 
intensity of affect lies the possibility of increasing the capacity for action. “There is always something 
more  than  what  is  actualized  in  social  life”  (Gould  2010:  21).  However,  as  Gould  alerts,  the 
discrepancy  between  affect  and  emotions  is  neither  temporal  nor  fully  graspable.  They  are 
simultaneous and, in the empirical world, we rarely get a clear demarcation. Yet, these distinctions 
and  clarifications  help  us  in  our  efforts  to  grasp  the  complex  matter  that  Grosz  defines  as  “the 
imperceptibility” (2004).  
 
Passions  
A few more details concern two other fields: that of passions, and that of feelings.  
The concept of passions is closely linked to what has been said so far, to the intersection of affect and 
emotions. Historically, interest in the emotional sphere has fallen on passions, also in linguistic terms. 
In  the  philosophical  tradition  there  is  an  effort  to  conceptualise,  and  thus  “rule”  passions.  From 
Aristotle, to Descartes, to Kant, passions must be subjugated, governed, enslaved, and as Caleo (2021) 
explains, the lexicon is not accidental. Politics, as a reflection on the disposition of the world and as 
an  action  to  govern  it,  emerges  from  the  outset  as  the  government  of passions.  Passions  are 
overwhelming, uncontrollable, they cloud the mind and the ability to decide rationally. Passions are 
the counterbalance of reason. The government of passions, as explained above, is also at the origin 
of capitalism as an economic model, built on the strength of interests. Passions are thus the dark side 
of  the  human  soul,  and  although  they  are  pervasive,  or  precisely  because of  this,  they  must  be 
carefully  reduced  to  a  manageable,  and  above  all  private,  dimension.  As  Caleo  further  explains 
(2021), the Latin etymology of passio is the matrix of both “passion” and “passive.” In this sense, the 
term is not neutral but gendered. Passions, passivity, are the domain of the feminine, and so the fear 
of emotionality from the beginning is a fear of passivity: “to be emotional is to be more feminine, 
more dependent, more vulnerable – and it is a characteristic that is attributed to some bodies or 
subjects and not to others” (Caleo 2021: 146). The root patio also alludes to the terms “pathological” 
and “to suffer,” and thus a proximity to illness. Passions thus indicate an alteration of the body, a 
deviation from the norm. The semantic field of passion, suffering, and passivity signals a minus, a 
decrease, a lack, a fallacy of the subject (Caleo 2021).  
The concept of passions is taken into account in this research precisely because it is a gendered 
concept. Among others, and more than others, it sheds light on the historical and social dimension 
that underpins the production of emotions, their non-neutral nature. What we feel, how we give 
meaning to it, and even the meaning we give to the simple fact of feeling is the result of a gender 

24 
 
regime and social norms that organise the production of subjects and their life possibilities. The 
production of the concept of passion also alludes to power, how it circulates, and how it defines 
bodies, life trajectories, and spaces of action. Passions, the way we feel, the way we express them, 
the way we use them, are the result of a certain organisation of power.  
What, then, does putting emotions and passions at the centre of political action imply, when emotions 
and passions have always been an instrument of subordination? It implies focusing on the way power 
circulates,  and  acting  for  a  different  circulation  of  power,  understood  as  the capacity  for  self-
expansion and action in the social world. For women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people, the work 
on affect, emotions, and passions is a work of unveiling social paradigms, but also of overturning 
them. It is precisely this dimension of subalternity that becomes a dimension of common reflection 
and collective action. The reversal of the stigma associated with passions opens up a field of intensity, 
potential, and circulation of power that was almost invisible until now, because it was disowned. As 
Elena Pulcini (2020) explains through feminist theories, it is possible to relocate the passions not as 
a field to be dominated – which would repropose the rational-utilitarian and masculine vision – but 
as a dimension to be taken care of, to be concerned about, to be understood. In addition to being an 
object of care, passions become the subject of a work of awareness that helps disentangle the social 
and political production around emotions. They are, in fact, more than manipulated by elites and 
politicians to guide common sense, distorted by the mass media, or frozen in stereotyped images. 
Mindfulness work allows to scratch the surface to bring out a non-judgmental self-image, an authentic 
understanding,  leading  to  transformation.  Understanding  emotions  means  freeing  them,  it  means 
deepening what animates us, and enhancing joyful passions to the detriment of sad passions, opening 
the way to a potential expansion of the self (Pulcini 2020).  
In choosing to refer to passions and history of thought behind the concept lies the choice of a feminist 
approach to social research. “A feminist perspective on gender is always about power. To paraphrase 
Cynthia Enloe, any feminist perspective puts politics—and thereby power—at the core of the analysis 
in a way that a gender analysis does not (Enloe 2010, xi–xii). In other words, the difference between 
gender analysis and feminist analysis is that the latter is always about changing the status quo. What 
is feminist is that which concerns political and social change and transformation. Thus, a feminist 
approach to the politics of emotion through gender is about how we become invested in social norms, 
it is about the affective investments in gender as a social norm” (Åhäll 2018: 36). This research 
investigates feminist movements, through a feminist positioning, the involvement of participants in 
the research process, and with a clear orientation towards social change. The matter of passions is 
therefore incandescent.  
 

25 
 
Feelings  
To conclude, I will try to define the concept of feelings. According to the Oxford Dictionary, it 
indicates what we perceive, the ability to feel a physical sensation, a physical or mental impression, 
feeling deeply, the awareness of a perceived emotion, the power to be able to frame it, the general 
state of consciousness considered independently of particular sensations. According to Gould, the 
term “feelings” has to be preferred “because they connote bodily, felt experience and also have been 
used in ways that reference the conventionality of felt experience” (2010: 22).  
I refer to the concept of feelings mainly because of its connection to the work of Raymond Williams 
(2015). He tries to explain how social change occurs, by conceptualising the structure of feelings. 
Often, the perception of the need for a change emerges as an opaque and vague sensation about 
something  wrong  with  regard  to  the  established  order.  This  affect,  these unconscious  and 
unarticulated intensities, drive us to a growing consciousness about social structures. To perceive that 
something is no longer working often comes with an affective state, that encourages to think that it 
should be different. This tension between the dominant account of the established order and the 
contradictions experienced at the affective level with regard to that account is often non-linguistic, 
latent, and detectable only at the level of perception. This uneven, unbundled way of feeling does not 
identify with the existing order. “Structures of feeling or affective states can shake one out of deeply 
grooved patterns of thinking and feeling and allow for new imaginings. A specific focus on affect, 
then,  opens  up  an  avenue  of  research  into  mobilization  and  social  change  that  is  obscured  by 
rationalist ontologies and by renderings of feelings that downplay elements that may not be articulable 
but that nevertheless exert force, shaping people’s experiences and knowledges of the world as well 
as their actions” (Gould 2010: 27). For this reason, I will refer to feminist spaces as structures of 
feelings that formalise a generalised feeling of discomfort, dissatisfaction, or discordance with the 
established order, channeling it into forms, meanings, tools, and methods of collective reworking that 
result in collective action.  
As  the  quote at  the  beginning  of  the  chapter made  explicit,  feminist  spaces  take  on  the  task  of 
channeling  subjective  affects  in  reference  to  a  social  context  often  experienced  as  violent, 
exclusionary, and hostile. The reworking of these vague, disjointed, and often opaque feelings takes 
place in concert with the other participants, through an unwritten pact to share a different perspective 
towards  the  structure.  The  sharing  of  the  affective  assumptions  of  the  action,  and  of  a  common 
willingness to subject emotions, creates the conditions for the emergence of a structure of feelings. 
Sometimes disjointed, sometimes undulating and indefinite, at other times more clearly systematised 
in a common methodology, it represents the difference of feminist politics in its relation to structure 
– such as the economic model, political elites, system of government, policies. Collective action vis-

26 
 
à-vis structure is in fact mediated, transformed, and enabled through the grid of affect. Through this 
affective-informed apparatus, feminist spaces address the confrontation with goals, counterparts, and 
the socio-political situation. Åhäll explains that: “feminism is often simplistically assumed to be 
‘only’ about women’s lives and experiences, about ‘identity politics.’ However, as Marysia Zalewski 
points out, it is more appropriate to think of feminism as primarily concerned with the kinds of 
questions that are fundamentally about how the world works (Zalewski 2015, 4). And of course, the 
world also works affectively and emotionally” (2018: 41). This quote helps outline the framework of 
feminist spaces as structures of feelings. Like any social movement, they identify their counterparts, 
central issues, and claims. These include every aspect of the lives of women, lesbians, trans, and non-
binary people, and thus include the economic model, policy management, governance of life, culture. 
The development of collective action, however, does not occur through a purely rational and strategic 
calculation. Feminism, in fact, is rooted in the effort to identify the political in the personal, and 
therefore in the sphere of subjectivity, emotions, and affect, the roots of social structures, norms, and 
established orders. This effort is further codified by feminist spaces, that have the ability to act in 
continuity, in daily life, and through physical places as well. In this sense, they are a privileged 
empirical case for exploring the construction of challenging structures of feelings, through a hitherto 
almost entirely removed channel, which is that of affect. The following section argues in favour of 
this physical dimension of feminist spaces as a illustrative case in the study of affect and social 
movements. 
 
The  section  argued  about  the  differences  among  the  concepts  of  affect,  emotions,  passions,  and 
feelings.  Affect  signals  the  vital  impulse  of  bodies,  while  emotions  the  codified,  linguistic,  and 
conscious  understanding  of  that  impulse.  The  work  on  affect  involves learning to  acknowledge, 
perceive, and define affect in the form of emotions, in order to make impulses likely to become 
political. The concept of passion serves as a tool to understand the historical and gendered production 
of our ideas about the emotional sphere, and thus how politics is always involved in the way we use 
or dismiss emotions. Finally, with reference to the work of Williams, the research addresses feelings 
as the medium between individuals, groups, and society, in the forms of structure – to target or to 
innovate the structures, through the work on affect and emotions.  
 
1.4 Spatialising Feminism  
   
Whatever the function, Belmont House served as a female world on some occasion for all members of the 
Woman’s Party and as a feminist space for women who identified with the women’s rights movement. 
(Rupp and Taylor, 1987: 41-42)

Why Spaces? 
In their 1987 work Surviving in the Doldrums. The American Women’s Rights Movement, 1945 to the 
1960s, Leila J. Rupp and Verta Taylor focus on the women’s rights movement in times of anti-
feminism and relatively latency of large mobilisations, giving a central role to Alva Belmont House, 
the headquarter of the National Woman’s Party. As they explain:  
The Woman’s Party Community centered around Alva Belmont House, national headquarters in 
Washington D.C., which served not only as an office but also as a permanent residence, feminist 
hotel for visitors coming to Washington, and clubhouse. [...] Belmont House played an important 
role in maintaining the women’s community. [...] Another member who traveled to Washington 
to  serve  as  house  manager  emphasized  the  importance  of  the  house  in  referring  to  its  “big 
contribution to the national and world women-movement.” Some of the members made their 
home there; one women wrote that she was “looking forward with joy to my return home, and 
Home to me now, means the dear Belmont House.” (Rupp and Taylor, 1987: 40)  
 
The quote is extremely useful to address why spaces and feminist communities are worth exploring. 
First, as the literature on free spaces shows (Evans and Boyte 1986, Polletta 1999), because the 
management of a space abducted from State control allows to root collective action in a physical site, 
that can be reached and that serves as a point of reference for the community and beyond. Second, 
physical  spaces  allow  to  preserve  continuity,  affective  bonds,  and  in-depth  political  elaboration. 
Third, physical spaces allow to meet, to share places and moments of discussion, to host bodies and 
contact between them. More than with other social movements, feminist movements invested time 
and energy to address the bodily and affective dimension of politics. Not surprisingly, the words of 
one of the members of Belmont House refers to it as the true home. In this expression, the boundaries 
between private and public blur, shedding light on the incessant work on affect carried out within the 
sites of the feminist movement, which unveils different ways of developing subjectivity, experiencing 
relationships, and constructing forms of collective action. In the contemporary world, the question 
might be: given the multiplication and pervasiveness of virtual spaces, if and how do physical spaces 
still matter? 
The focus on space might be unusual or outdated, in the time of progressively dematerialised spaces 
and big data, web platforms, where “enormous quantities of information can be collected in minimal 
spaces,” and when “we are coming into contact with spaces which are no longer based on our direct 
physical experience” (Melucci 1989: 106). At the same time, as the global spread of the Covid-19 
health emergency dramatically showed, bodies, contacts, spaces, and the politics of proximity are still 
at the core of our lives, far beyond virtual connections, and the lack of these spaces of proximity and 
physical contact has a strong impact on individuals and communities (della Porta 2020, Saladino et 
al. 2020).  

28 
 
Scholars worked on the relationship between social movements and media platforms, through media 
practices (Mattoni 2016, della Porta and Mattoni 2014), communication repertoires (Wright 2004), 
and integrated communication spaces (Hamm 2005). As Pavan and Mainardi (2020) argue, virtual 
spaces are often heavily interconnected with lived experiences, and this bridge informs, for instance, 
the development of knowledge on discriminatory workspaces. This research builds on the social 
movement  studies’ understanding  of  physical  spaces  and  virtual  spaces,  by  arguing  about  the 
mediation of affect within physical spaces, bodily and cognitive practices, and the concatenation of 
bodies. More than before, the pandemic sheds light on interdependency as a bodily matter. While 
most of our interactions and relationships in the recent years have shifted online, especially during 
periods of lockdown and social distancing, an awareness has emerged about the need for physical 
places  in  which  to  enjoy  bodily  encounters  and  relationships  in  presence.  The  link  between  the 
strategic use of media platforms and the centrality of thinking in presence is at the heart of the 
reflections of the contemporary feminist movement (Zamboni 2009, DiElle 2019). It is an ambivalent 
nexus, according to which virtual spaces can never resolve the significance of relations in presence. 
The feminist movement developed its reflections and claims on the body, through the body, and 
among bodies. Feminist spaces are therefore the natural consequence of this reflection, as embodied 
spaces in which the possibility of the relationship between bodies as a ground for collective action 
unfolds.  
 
Gender Inequalities, Urban Spaces and Political Participation 
In the last twenty years, a spatial turn occurred in social sciences. However, spatial analysis and urban 
studies often neglect gender division as an element that structures urban spaces and urban processes 
(McDowell  1983).  As  scholars  suggest,  the  structure  of  social  relations  that  produces  female 
oppression and gender segregation requires an analysis of the organisation, use, and conception of 
urban  space.  With  the  consolidation  of  neoliberalism  in  the  1980s,  the  market  logic,  profit,  and 
eurocentrism informed the changes of urban planning and organisation according to the leading idea 
of progress and development. As Peake and Rieker suggest, “the responsibility for the self (as through 
micro-credit) and the individual as consumer, undergird specific institutional and political urban 
contexts, while regulatory frameworks, distinguished by the growth of finance capital and market 
liberalisation, have resulted in a growing separation of societal needs and democratic politics. These 
processes have been actualised at the urban scale through varied and complex transformations of 
urbanisms,  resulting  in  a  range  of  new  urban  spatialities”  (2013:  3).  The  reorganisation  of  the 
productive and reproductive labour market insists on certain gender logics, which have an impact on 
the organisation of space. Space is constructed according to a certain subject – male, white, able-

29 
 
bodied,  heterosexual,  young,  middle-class.  Those  who  do  not  inhabit  this  category  perceive  the 
boundaries and exclusions that result from it. It is no coincidence that the study of women and urban 
space has largely focused on emotions – fear, discomfort, frustration – and the limitation of their 
ability to experience the city. In this framework, it is even more clearl why the reflection on urban 
space from a gendered perspective led to the use of the concept of “safety.” As in the case of Toronto, 
Canada, that in the 1980s focused on urban safety from a gendered perspective by including the fear 
of sexual violence in the political agenda (Whitzman, 1992). In that case, the approach to safety 
included participatory planning process, transport systems, and education programmes. However, 
critiques to the narrative on fear, women, and urban spaces emerged, because they seemed to confirm 
a stereotype more than exploring the complexity of social categories (Pain 1991). Trying to avoid the 
reiteration of the narrative on women as weak, surveys show how women and migrants are still the 
most vulnerable and fearful subjects in the urban space (Listerborn 2016). These feelings shape their 
life and mobility according to the need to avoid risks and threats. Moreover, gender-based violence 
keeps taking place primarily in the domestic setting. On the individual level, fear of violence and 
abuse in the domestic setting reinforces fear in the public space (Pain 2001).  
Still,  it  is  important  to  unpack  the  social  production  of  fear  as  a  gendered  emotion.  “Instead  of 
describing women as fearful, Hille Koskela (1997) pointed to the social construction of fear, with the 
result that the boldness of women who did walk alone at night in the city was defined as a risky 
behaviour” (Listerborn 2016: 253). As Listerborn further argues, “in a Western neoliberal context, 
safety and freedom from violence are becoming a commodity, since issues of fear and safety have 
been co-opted by the authorities, property companies and other stakeholders. As a result, there has 
been  an  increasing  focus  on  control,  surveillance  and  security  within  a  ‘safety  discourse’  that 
dominates planning and urban renewal. Women and their fear of sexual violence are used as an 
argument for urban renewal projects” (2016: 252).  
Accounting for complexity means exploring the agency of those considered marginalised, such as 
women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people. In a framework of welfare contraction, neoliberal 
reorganisation, social inequalities, and gender-based violence, looking at forms of collective action 
from  a  gendered  perspective  allows  for  a  different  perspective  on  the  use,  organisation,  and 
transformation of urban space. As Melucci stresses out, “A necessary condition of democracy in this 
sense are public spaces independent of the institutions of government, the party system and state 
structures. These spaces assume the form of an articulated system of decision-making negotiation and 
representation, in which the signifying practices developed in everyday life can be expressed and 
heard independently from formal political institutions” (1989: 173). The focus on the agency and 
collective action of marginalised subjects allows: 1) an understanding of the conversion and use of 

30 
 
spaces in the city according to different gender norms; 2) an understanding of the impact on individual 
biographies, mobility, and life in relation to urban spaces; 3) the impact of collective action, through 
physical spaces in relation to the organisation and management of the city. This approach makes it 
possible to look at the macro level, and thus at the relationship between agency and structure; at the 
meso  level,  and  thus  at  collective  action  and  the  construction  of  physical  spaces  and  supportive 
communities; at the micro level, and thus at individual paths.  
In the next section, I will try to look at the issue of safety and spaces through the lens of affect and 
emotions.  
 
Safety, Affect and Emotions 
We need shelter because the world sucks. [...] Because we are freaks to the world, unacceptable. 
We are people who lead dysfunctional existences for most of the functional trajectories of the 
capitalist  system.  Because  we  don't  conform  to  the  norm,  because  we  are  not  heterosexual, 
because we don't have normalised relationships, because we don't want to, we tend to strive to 
work but we are not fulfilled by our jobs, because we don't have the money, because we are 
sometimes poor, because we are sometimes ugly according to the dominant aesthetic standards, 
because the world is a lousy place. It's a dangerous world. It's a world where a lot of us have 
experienced a lot of violence. On various levels. Starting from families, but also from life on the 
street, from life in relationships. There is a need for a place to shelter. This can be a physical place 
or not. You can't always be in the front line. Sometimes you need to stop and breathe. Shelter is 
a place where you stop for a moment and breathe. Maybe not alone.  [...] Sometimes spaces are 
also useful to take care of our wounds without necessarily causing us new ones. Being in the front 
line  means  being  face  to  face  with  the  oppression  that  crushes  you.  And  to  suck  all  the 
consequences  of  this.  Sometimes  being  in  our  material  and  non-material  spaces  also  means 
allowing yourself the luxury of stopping, entrusting yourself, healing your wounds together with 
your sisters, together with the other people you have chosen and recovering the energy to put 
yourself back into the fray and put yourself back into the shit of the world. I don't have this idea 
of occupied spaces as places that are completely detached from society, where I create these 
bubbles of well-being that are completely detached from reality. Each of us goes outside of those 
spaces, gets away from our sisters and lives our lives in other spheres. And very often you get an 
avalanche of shit. Of verbal violence, of symbolic violence, of acted violence, of oppression. So 
sometimes you stop and you go back to your shelter, there you build your resistance, there you 
build your practices that strengthen you, of empowerment, of resistance, of self-defence, but then 
you act in the world. Even outside the four physical walls of that space. (IIIR10, CS, 31) 
 
In this long quote,  a participant of the space of Cagne Sciolte, in Rome, makes explicit the relation 
between safety, urban space, affect, and emotions. The relationship with urban space, for those who 
do not enjoy the privilege of living in a category provided for by the organisation of the city, is a 
relationship mediated by affects. Fear of violation and abuse, a constant feeling of being out of place, 
the need to transform strongly constrictive emotions into tools for acquiring strength, awareness, and 
the ability to act. This process takes place through the connection with other people within a physical 
space, and is mediated by affects. The perception of the lack of security, therefore, drives the search 
for a space for oneself. This security, however, is not an acquisition that is made within the space. In 

31 
 
fact, the intersectional perspective (Crenshaw 1991, Hill Collins 1991) helps understand how power 
acts  continuously  in  social  interactions  and  arranges  relationships,  even  in  contexts  that  tend  to 
subvert those power relationships. In the previous section, I started with some reflections on the issue 
of safety. Here, I will widen the definition of the concepts this research refers to.  
This work was developed through three languages: Italian, English, and Spanish. Mindsets strongly 
depend on language: concepts, notions, categories, and ways of understanding realities are situated 
in a specific idiom, with a proper history, background, and scope of meanings. The never-ending 
work of translation from one language to another is an effort at the basis of this research, which leaves 
unsolved blind spots and contradictions. First, the effort of definition depends on a linguistic gap. 
“Safety” has different meanings and different semantic, political, and social backgrounds in all the 
three linguistic fields of the research: English (safety), Italian (sicurezza), Spanish (seguridad). “Safe 
space,” in the English version, is often a conventional formula used by non-English speakers, and it 
helps overcome the difficulties of the concept in the native language. Yet, some issues remain.   
The main trouble concerns the use of safety in mainstream neoliberal discourses. The governments, 
with regard to public order and urban decay, tend to enact legislation concerning “security” and 
“safety” (della Porta and Reiter 1998, Collins 2016). A whole field of sub-studies in International 
Relations interpret security  as  a  key  factor  in  sovereignty,  the  State,  and  international  relations. 
Wolfers points out that security “in any objective sense, measures the absence of threats to acquired 
values, in a subjective sense, the absence of fear that such values will be attacked” (1952: 150). These 
words are thus related to policing, order, and social control.  
A harsh discussion involved media and public discourse in the post 9/11 period, when so-called 
terrorism emerged as the object of public policies and generalised fears (Ranstorp 2009, Jackson, 
Smyth and Gunning 2009, Silke 2009). The rhetoric of safety and security has often  been consequent 
to episodes of urban gender-based violence. Frequently, after cases of rape, harassment, or injury 
against women in public space – especially if they are pursued by non-native men – local and national 
governments  succeeded  with  new  restrictive  regulation  and  orderings  “in  the  name  of  women’s 
rights” and of women’s protection (Farris 2017, Simone 2012). Feminist movements contest this 
instrumental  use  of  women that  blames gender-based  violence  on  migrant  people  and  thus 
implements reactionary public order policies. The same mechanism also interested LGBT and queer 
people, who have been involved in the production of a new image of “the nation” in return for a 
supposed  protection  and  inclusion  in  the  State,  against  the  “barbarian  others.”  A  process  called 
homonationalism by Jasbir Puar (2007), and femonationalism by Sara Farris (2017), where women 
begin to be complicit with xenophobic claims and policies.  

32 
 
This neoliberal understanding of security and safety is questioned by feminist, LGBT, and queer 
groups. Participants struggle to find new words, because they acknowledge the slippery ground of 
these concepts.  
As much as affect and feelings prompt the sense of insecurity, so is security a matter of affect. 
Questioned about the first words coming to their minds when thinking about the space, an interviewee 
replied: “Warm, red. Very strong feelings. [...] Because in some way it is linked to the concept of 
home, I think. This thing of warmth, of welcome, of embrace. In any case, even if I quickly pass by, 
I'm happy, I go for a walk, check that everything is alright... I also like washing dishes. So it's a place 
that gives you a pleasant feeling” (IIIR5, CS, 30). This quote shows a strong connection among 
affects, emotions, and the concept of safety. Participants refer to an affective vocabulary to describe 
their connection to the space and to the other participants. Together with these elements, others soon 
emerged in the definition of safety, proceeding through an emotional and instinctual path. The main 
one is that safety is a matter of community, of feminist ties. It challenges the individualism embedded 
in the neoliberal idea of safety – as a sense of security that concerns individuals or, at most, the family. 
Moreover, this way of collectively producing the space is the path through which the space becomes 
safe. Safety in feminist spaces is not a given, but rather an ongoing process that involves all of the 
participants, made up of attempts, mistakes, and successful experiments. Through the production of 
ties and the elaboration on affect, participants become self-conscious, and they build new tools to 
manage their everyday life. At the collective level, ties and elaboration on emotions are answers to 
fear,  danger, and  dispossession.  By  dealing  with  collective  emotions,  FS  enhance  strategies  and 
tactics to face an unsafe world (Pain 1991, Belingardi, Castelli and Olcuire 2019).   
Thus, the concept of safety relates to the outside world, but it is also a matter of self-awareness, on 
one side, and political organisation, on the other side. It calls into question the issue of power: power 
as the factor organising social structures, and power as a process of reappropriation of words, tools, 
networks, and spaces to deal with unequal social structures. So much of the perception of security is 
about power that only by subverting its distribution is it possible to build a sense of self in a world of 
social inequality. I clearly understood this concept talking with Sara, a five-year-old girl hosted at the 
House of Women Lucha Y Siesta with her mother. “At a certain point Sara drags us out because she 
says there is a thief. As we are talking, I ask her if she is afraid of thieves and she says: ‘no, I beat 
them.’” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 12-07-19). Paradoxically, since all of the feminist spaces included in the 
research were under the threat of eviction at the time of the research, the main source of fear and 
unsafety  for  participants  were  institutions.  More  than  protect  them,  as  it  would  be  expected, 
institutions are perceived as a source of menace, attack, and danger. The threat produces feelings of 
anger and frustration: while institutions refuse to acknowledge feminist spaces, at the same time they 

33 
 
lack the services and welfare toward citizens that feminist spaces are fulfilling. I opened this analysis 
with the conventional meaning of safety, coming from an institutional setting, and it is now reversing 
its sense exactly at the opposite.  
Thus, the reference to safety in feminist spaces is directed, on the one hand, internally, building spaces 
in which to feel better, and on the other hand externally, to collective action against those social 
structures that produce a deep sense of insecurity for certain subjects. 
Once again, affect serves as the grid to understand the relation between women, lesbians, trans, and 
non-binary people and the urban space, as well as the grid through which forms of collective action 
that address safety proliferate. On the ridge of safety and affect, this research will try to develop our 
understanding of collective action from a gender perspective.  
 
Thus, to conclude, the research looks at physical spaces managed by feminist movements (1.3) to 
understand the work on affect and emotions (1.2), and the way this work produces consequences with 
regard to the micro, meso and macro levels – such as on democracy and capitalism (1.1).  
 
 
1.5 Research design, Orientation and Feminist Standpoint  
  
... the feeling of, by making a quote, putting power into circulation rather than enjoying a power. 
(IIIR7, CS, 30) 
   
The thesis is the result of a participatory action research with participants involved in three feminist 
spaces in Rome and three in Madrid, through constructivist theory method (CGTM) and feminist 
methodologies. The process started with a research question: 
How do feminist movements imagine, produce, and preserve safer spaces? 
According to CGTM, I started with an intuition, a puzzle. As mentioned in the preface, I followed an 
embodied feeling to focus on a research question addressed to understanding a social phenomenon. 
The issue of safety from a feminist perspective oriented my initial approach to the fieldwork and to 
participants. With three feminist spaces in Rome and three spaces in Madrid, I prepared the access 
through several contacts, that I will better clarify in Chapter 3. To spatialise the analysis of safe 
spaces, I looked at feminist physical spaces. Among the variety of feminist spaces, I tried to focus on 
the most different cases in the spectrum of spaces that pursue political elaboration and collective 
action (and so avoiding those feminist spaces, like leisure places or profit-making places, such as 
bookshops or clubs). The cases selection involved three types of spaces: an historical house of women 

34 
 
relatively  institutionalised  (Casa  Internazionale  delle  donne  in  Rome;  Espacios  de  Igualdad  in 
Madrid); a feminist space engaged with direct social actions (casa delle donne Lucha Y Siesta in 
Rome; Kasa pùblica transfeminista Eskalera Karakola in Madrid); a radical, intersectional, queer, and 
transfeminist group (the space of Cagne Sciolte in Rome; Plataforma Encuentros Bolleros in Madrid). 
With them, we negotiated further issues to address than the research question, we set up the timing 
and space of the research, methods of data collection, data analysis, and eventual dissemination of 
results. CGTM allows to conduct data collection and analysis simultaneously in an iterative process 
(Charmaz 2006). Given the participatory nature of the research, the participants were involved as 
much as possible in each stage of the research, from the formulation of the questions to the analysis 
of the data.  
Through a participatory, iterative, inductive, and never-ending process I move from the concept of 
safe spaces to the one of affect as a guiding concept in order to frame the relation between structure 
and agency; how feminist communities are built and managed; how political participation occurs in 
feminist spaces; how they relate to the surrounding environment.  
To account for the participatory, inductive, and iterative process of the research that brought to theory 
construction rather than description, the manuscript proceeds in two parts.  
After the introduction, Part I aims to set the stage. In Chapter 2, I go through the literature of social 
movement studies, feminist theory, and affect theory to develop a theoretical framework among the 
three strains of the literature, and beyond some gaps. Chapter 3 addresses the ethical choices that 
orient the research. Then, I will explain the points of junction between the three approaches that 
construct the research: participatory action research, CGTM, feminist methodology. Finally, Chapter 
4 introduces the Italian and Spanish contexts, and the six cases studies.  
Part II of the manuscript presents the empirical analysis through CGTM. It draws from the fieldwork 
conducted  in  Rome  (September  2018-February  2020)  and  Madrid  (January  2021-May  2021). 
Although the fieldwork lasted approximately as long as indicated, participatory research does not 
allow a canonical start and end date to be identified. Contact with the participants began in the first 
year, and continues to this day, even during the writing of the manuscript. This open process is one 
of the fundamental characteristics of the research, whose findings are rooted in the relationship, 
confrontation, and continuous exchange with the participants. Given the inductive, participatory and 
iterative nature of this research, the chapters are not strictly structured in a comparative manner.  
To account for the empirical process, the analysis of data, and funding, I will start from the research 
questions  at  the  basis  of  the five chapters.  These  further  research  questions  emerged  during  the 
analysis of data pursued through CGTM, and they progressively expanded and changed the initial 
puzzle.  

35 
 
Chapter 5 starts from the research question:  
How does the work on affect pursued by feminist spaces interplay with the structure (economic 
model, institutions, laws, norms, values and beliefs)? 
 
To answer this question, I will go through the context of a multiple crisis – political, economic, 
environmental, health – that feminist spaces are undergoing. The crises allow to point out those 
structures at work in the definition of feminist spaces’ counterparts: the economic model, institutions, 
the structure of codes and norms. To relate with these structures, feminist spaces develop alternative 
models of economy and institutions grounded in the work on affect. This work also orients their 
interaction with players, at the local and national level, and at the level of the feminist movements. 
Affect,  emotions,  and  feelings  are  embedded  in  the  creation  of  strategies  and  action  that  allow 
feminist spaces to increase the capacity to relate with players and arenas on one hand, and on the 
other to develop agency with regard to structures.  
Chapter 6 moves from the puzzle:  
How do affects such as fear, anger, and discontent ground the choice of managing a physical place 
as a collective action? 
 
To address the issue, the chapter explores the choice to engage with urban spaces through the creation 
of feminist spaces, and how this choice takes the shape of alternative structures of feelings.  The 
second  part  of  the  chapter  closely  looks  at  how  affects  are  mobilised  in  collective  action:  the 
perception of safety is the result of a process where feelings are at stake. Because of this centrality of 
affect and emotions, the research formulates the potential of affect for collective action, or as to take 
affect into account and to develop positive feelings increase the capacity for collective action both at 
the individual and collective level. Affects emerge as 1) a channel of mediation between cognition 
and body, 2) a tool for political elaboration, and 3) a competence in action. With regard to the third 
function, Chapter 7 asks: 
How are affects made into action? 
 
To search for an answer, the chapter looks at the recasting of time and space pursued by feminist 
spaces. Feminist  time  discloses  other  affective  opportunities  and  lets  people  go  through  the 
comprehension of their commitment, ideas, and engagement in political participation. The work on 
affect spurs the perception of the feminist space as a home, with contradictions and potentials. To 
better understand how affects and emotions are made into action, the second part of the chapter looks 
at the repertoire of action, through innovation, the production of knowledge, and direct social action. 
Emotions do not only provide information about the starting point, but also about political orientation. 
They increase the capacity for individual participation, the consistency with the structure of feelings, 
and therefore the potential of collective action. 

36 
 
As well as the macro and meso level, the research explores the work on affect at the micro level. 
Thus, chapter 8 asks:  
How does the work on affect and emotions interplay with the individual paths of participants? 
 
Affect and emotions play a central role in becoming feminist, because they enhance the process of 
mobilisation, socialisation and commitment to feminist ideas. Participants learn to reflect on affect 
and emotions: why they take that form, how they move, what is the use that can be made of them. 
Emotions cannot be ignored or dribbled out. Awareness of affect and emotions, instead, produces a 
change in people, and increases their knowledge of themselves and their possibility to act in the world. 
Affect and emotions have an impact in the long run, as well, as the analysis of biographical outcomes 
accounts for.  
Chapter 9, finally, proposes some hints for the comparison between Italy and Spain. The outbreak of 
the pandemic heavily impacted on feminist spaces and the fieldwork, as well. Even if constrained by 
the health crisis, the fieldwork in Spain put forward some challenging findings. First, the role of State 
feminism, almost absent in Italy and quite spread in Spain, in the creation of feminist spaces. The 
massive and strong presence of feminist movements within institutions enhances the proliferation of 
a feminist sensibility, of feminist spaces, and of affective practices. The outbreak of the pandemic 
allowed to look at the mechanism of the work on affect in an emergency situation, since the emotions 
of grief, despair, fear, and mourning were elaborated on and transformed through the tools developed 
by feminist spaces over time.  
To  conclude,  Chapter  10  recalls  the  path  and  the  purpose  of  the  project,  explaining the  main 
theoretical and empirical contributions, but it also addresses the limitations and possibility for further 
development of the research. In the annex, I will include the anonymised list of all the interviews 
conducted.  
This is a situated research, that I carried out through an ambivalent stance: as researcher, and as a 
feminist activist. As Haraway (1988), Rich (1984) and Harding (1987) write, it is time to put aside 
the illusion of a false neutrality in social research. Instead of ignoring the writer's positioning, the 
manuscript attempts to make explicit and thus account for proximity and distance to the field. 
The place from which to speak and write is also a place of relationship and imagination, which I have 
tried to bring to the table as ethically as possible throughout the research. In this sense, the empty and 
full spaces of the manuscript, the potentials and limitations, are also the result of my emotional 
development in relation to the research work. As Åhäll explains: 
Nonfeminist scholars seem convinced that feminist knowledge does not concern them—a feeling 
reproduced by a common misunderstanding that feminism is only about “identity politics” or 
“women’s stuff.” This lack of engagement with feminist theory and methodologies continues 

37 
 
despite,  or  perhaps  as  a  result  of,  the  opening  up  of  those  spaces  for  feminist  research.  [...] 
“emotion” is a term that has long been associated with the personal, the body, the feminine. As 
the constitutive other of “reason” (as well as the objective, the mind, the masculine) in Western, 
binary modes of thinking, “emotion” has been (and still is) a political strategy keeping women 
and the feminine out of politics and political spheres. As a result, much of feminist scholarship 
has   worked   to   problematize   binaries   such   as   emotion/reason,   mind/body,   and 
domestic/international. All this is to say that feminist scholarship has a very long history with 
“the emotional” (2018: 37)  
This research is part of the very long history of feminist scholarship with “the emotional.” In an 
attempt  to  understand  the  link  between  awareness  of  affect  and  emotions  and  the  potential  for 
collective  action,  the  research  aims  to,  more  generally,  further  our  understanding  of  social 
movements, of the processes that implement democracy, and of people’s search for happiness and 
social change. This situated place, from which to look at the social world, is the starting point of the 
following manuscript.  
Let’s begin the journey.

2. The Theoretical Framework: Bridging Social Movements Studies, 
Affect Theory and Feminist Theory 
 
 
2.1 Introduction 
 
Feminist and queer scholars have shown us that emotions ‘matter’ for politics; emotions show us how power 
shapes the very surface of bodies as well worlds. So in a way, we do ‘feel our way’.  
(Ahmed 2014: 12)  
  
In the age of globalisation, urbanisation, and constant re-configuration of political areas, feminist 
spaces (henceforth FSs) are challenging sites of analysis in order to spatialise the understanding of 
collective action, emotions, and the circulation of power. The relational process of becoming safer 
sheds light on the way affects and emotions shape collective action. 
The empirical analysis will specifically look at 1) how the relation between agency and structure is 
mediated by the work on affects, 2) how affects and emotions are made into collective action, 3) how 
the work on affects interplays with the paths of actors. 
These questions orient both the theoretical framework and the empirical analysis. In order to explore 
these research questions, I will engage with some heurist devices developed by three strains of the 
literature: social movement studies, feminist theory, and affect theory. The chapter is intended to 
present  the  theoretical  framework  of  my  research  project.  The  research  has  an  interdisciplinary 
approach. These disciplines have their own legacy, background, and concepts. Despite the differences 
among the three, my aim is to focus on contact zones, the intersection of which is able to explain the 
mechanisms occurring in the FSs.  
The empirical analysis relies on a two-years ethnography performed in Rome and Madrid, by looking 
at three types of FSs: longstanding houses of women; feminist spaces that engage with direct social 
action; radical transfeminist and queer spaces. These spaces make use of different types of action: 
occupation, self-management, negotiation of a rent, direct control of the municipality.  
In this research project, affect is taken in consideration as the core of political action. Affects do not 
enrich or empower political action, but they are the very matter of it. My argument is that feminist 
politics is based on a conscious work on affects, and the capacity to name, negotiate, and reverberate 
affect has transformative effects. As Gould argues, affect indicates “nonconscious and un-named, but 
nevertheless registered, experiences of bodily energy and intensity that arise in response to stimuli 
impinging on the body” (2009: 19). Emotions, instead, outline “what of affect – what of the potential 
of bodily intensities – gets actualized or concretized in the flow of living. [...] Where affect is unfixed, 

39 
 
unstructured, noncoherent, and nonlinguistic, an emotion is one’s personal expression of what one is 
feeling in a given moment, an expression that is structured by social convention, by culture” (Gould 
2009: 20). The perception of affect can induce efforts to understand the feeling, to give it a name, to 
develop  a  conscious  use  of  it.  As  Gould  argues,  through  this  effort  a  transformation  occurs,  “a 
reduction  of  an  unstructured  and  unrepresentable  affective  state  with  all  of  its potential  into  an 
emotion or emotions whose qualities are conventionally known and fixed. [...] An emotion, in other 
words,  brings  a  vague  bodily  intensity  or  sensation  into  the  realm  of  cultural  meanings  and 
normativity, systems of signification that structure our very feelings” (2009: 21). The concept of 
affect stresses the capacity of transmission – or the capacity to affect and be affected by, and thus the 
nexus between emotions and collective action. Affect transcends the individual and sheds light on the 
inter-subjective and chained dimension of bodies, or how bodies, spaces, and objects are in a constant 
relationship mediated by the gradient of intensity generated in the relationship (Ahmed 2004). The 
research therefore looks at affects as intensities generated by the relationship and taken on in the 
relationship, capable of constructing concatenations of bodies and, through the work of awareness, 
collective action. Notwithstanding this, the concepts of affect and emotion will both be used to signal 
the sphere  of  individual  and  collective  action  that  transcends  the  limits  of  rational  and  strategic 
thinking, yet still includes it. Affects work as 1) a mediation between cognition and body, 2) a tool 
for political elaboration, and 3) competence in action. The work on affects increases the capacity for 
collective action, both at the individual and collective level. A vibrant comprehension of collective 
affects allows FSs to pursue their search for social change, with continuity (Taylor 1989), contention 
(McAdam, Tarrow and Tilly 2001), and innovation (Staggenborg 1989, 1995). In this sense, the 
empirical  analysis  of  affect  makes  it  possible  to  investigate  the  potential  for  collective  action 
(Massumi 2015). 
First,  I  will  explore  the  development  of  concepts  coming  from  social  movement  studies.  To 
understand agency and structure, collective action and paths of actors, the research engages with new 
social movement theory, resource mobilisation theory, and reflections on emotions. By questioning 
some blind spots, I will try to add some reflections coming from feminist theory that would improve 
the understanding of free spaces’ dynamics. The literature on social movement and emotions will be 
explored through the lens of affect theory. This bridge, rarely drawn in the field of social movement 
studies, enhances the comprehension of “twilight zones” (Massumi 2015), which sometimes fall out 
from our understanding. Finally, I will revisit the literature on safer spaces, and the way it intersects 
and improves the literature on free spaces.

2.2 Bridging Social Movement Studies and Feminist Theory 
 
The Upsurge of Social Movement Studies  
In this paragraph, I will try to bridge social movement studies, gender studies and feminist theory, 
by highlighting some gaps in the literature which are coming either from a missed interdisciplinary 
link  or  from  an  unheard  challenge  coming  from  feminist movements.  Social  movements  and 
collective action have long been the focus of interest for generations of scholars. The way social 
conflict emerges, changes over time and shapes social structures has come under the scrutiny of 
numerous theories and orientations of thought.  
Emotions, collective action, and social structures were central concepts in the birth of the discipline. 
At the turn of the century, classical approaches were mainly focused on collective behaviour as a 
result of “dissatisfaction with the current form of life” (Blumer 1995: 60). Social mobilisations were 
considered “amorphous, poorly organized, and without form; collective behaviour is primitive and 
the  mechanisms  of  interaction  are  elementary  and  spontaneous”  (ibidem).  Authors  like  Smelser 
(1962) and Le Bon (2002) were concerned by the emotional outburst of collective behaviour, while 
others, like Davies (1969) and Gurr (1970), with the relative deprivation causing people’s willingness 
to protest. Quite generally, these authors interpret contentious politics as an unconventional type of 
political participation. A symptom of a distortion of democracy, as opposed to social order.  
A significant turn occurs in the 1960s, when the outbreak of massive social movements required new 
tools for explanation. Scholars became concerned with the need to explore social movements as 
carriers of democratic processes, and they aimed at explaining them through political opportunity 
structure (Eisinger 1973, Tarrow 1998, Meyer 2004); resource mobilisation (McCarthy and Zald 
1977);  framing  (Benford  and  Snow  2000);  rational  choice  (Olson  1965).  The  more  new  social 
movements emerged, such as the women, environmental, and LGBT movements, beyond the labour 
movements, the more scholars have worked on the production of collective identity and culture as a 
matter (Touraine 1981, Melucci 1989). Authors like Goodwin, Jasper, and Polletta, by challenging 
the  structural  approaches  to  social  movements,  engage  with  emotions  as  a  key  factor  for 
mobilisations (2001).  
How do these different approaches inform our understanding of contemporary social movements? 
Which concepts are useful for the analysis of FSs and which are still missing? First of all, I will 
engage with some concepts, such as resources, continuity, and contention. Then, I will focus on the 
1960s turn, which was focused on the social movements’ shift from materialist to post-materialist 

41 
 
values. Finally, I will go through gender as a category of analysis (Scott 1986), which was only 
recently  embedded  in  the  study  of  social  movements.  Feminist  theory  has  been  developed  as  a 
discipline and quite rarely melted in a unique perspective with social movements studies, and this 
research attempts to partially bridge the gap. 
 
Contention, Resource and Continuity 
Feminist spaces are both nonnormative collective action (in the case of occupied centres with a 
consequent illegal status) and normative (in the case of municipal-assigned centres or centres with a 
formal negotiation with institutions to manage the space). They are created between “the structure of 
everyday life and the structure of protests” (Piven and Cloward 1991: 435). Although free spaces are 
not included in the definition of contentious politics (McAdam, Tarrow and Tilly 2001), scholars 
improved our understanding of spatialities and contention, by the means of how “the characteristics 
of place and space influence the abilities of insurgents to mount collective challenges to their political 
opponents” (Nicholls, Miller and Beaumont 2013: 13). Della Porta, Fabbri and Piazza (2013) argue 
that protests against the construction of big infrastructures elaborate an alternative conception of 
spaces and liberated terrains. “If the sense of place influenced the protests, the protests produced new 
definitions of places as collective identities developed in ‘liberated’ as well as ‘contested’ spaces” 
(Nicholls, Miller and Beaumont 2013: 13). This research engages with FSs that make use of different 
type of action: occupation, self-management, negotiation of a rent, direct control of the municipality. 
FSs, thus, are spaces of contention, where collective actors put forward their claims against more than 
one claimant, through conventional and unconventional action (such as occupation, strike, protests, 
sit-ins),  in  several  fields  (gender  regime,  urban  space,  social  norms,  government  of  the  city). 
Nonetheless, the production of feminist spaces is not episodic, but structurally involved in the process 
of urban development. McAdam, Tilly and Tarrow aim at investing only those episodes of contention 
that  “occur  in  public”  (2001:  5)  because  they  are  the  only  ones  “having  manifestly  political 
ramification” (2001: 6). This definition has been questioned by feminist scholars, because it excludes 
women and several other subjects from the notion of politics and public space. Re-thinking the notion 
of  politics  and  public  from  a  feminist  perspective  means  questioning  the  micro-practices  of 
movements,  the  meso-level  dynamics  of  urban  pattern,  and  the  broader  meaning  of  democracy. 
Moreover,  the  notion  of  public  excludes  all  of  those  experiences  which  take  place  in  a  private 
dimension. During the 1960s and 1970s, feminists tried to break up the traditional split between the 
private and public spheres, through the well-known slogan “the personal is political.” The sentence 
calls for the political impact of what has traditionally been confined to the private dimension, like 
marriage, sexuality, social reproduction, childcare. The entrance of private and domestic facts in the 

42 
 
public sphere stimulated changes in norms, roles, reproductive choices, self-determination. Even 
more significantly, the slogan disrupts the hidden phenomena of domestic violence against women, 
calling for a public takeover of a non-private problem which affects women. Changing the common 
understanding  of  the  public  sphere  means  for  Fraser  (1990)  elaborating  “feminist  subaltern 
counterpublics, [...] parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent 
and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations 
of their identities, interests, and needs” (Fraser 1990: 67). 
The literature on resource mobilisation, and some scholars such as Gamson (1975), underline the role 
of high-structured organisations and centralised authority to grant collective action’s success. The 
observation of many challengers showed that long-lasting activity is significantly promoted by a large 
number of resources. However, in my case, I am not engaging with fully formed organisations, but 
rather physical spaces managed by communities that rejected formalisation and bureaucratisation, by 
opting  for  non-hierarchical  structure  and  deliberative  democracy.  Despite  low-formalisation,  the 
cases under investigation have existed for a minimum of 4 years, and at most since 1983. As Taylor 
(1989) suggests, spaces are often carriers of continuity between cycles of contention. A strand of 
social movements literature stressed out movements emerging in the 1960s as exceptionally new, 
performing a break with earlier movements that, according to Taylor’s vision, are instead connected 
by several flows and processes. More than ruptures, this re-emergence of movements is a “turning 
point  in  movement  mobilization”  (1989:  761).  According  to  resource  mobilisation  theory,  she 
pinpoints political opportunities and organisational base as prominent factors in the rise and decline 
of movements (Taylor 1989, McAdam 1982, Jenkins 1983). Borrowed from the theory of social 
control (Mizruchi 1983, Taylor 1989), the term “abeyance” points out those organisations which 
retain dissident groups or people, potential challengers to the status quo, keeping them from putting 
forward too critical claims or actions. Social movements continuity is intended to be a substantial 
contribute to social change. It is still questionable how much “abeyance” and “latency” are proper 
words to depict movements phases of less visibility, as long as structures, culture, and actions keep 
existing.  More  than  abeyance,  movement  phases  can  be  framed  on a  scale  of  greater  or  lesser 
intensity.  Following  Taylor’s  concept  of  abeyance,  as  “a  holding  process  by  which  movements 
sustain themselves in nonreceptive political environments and provide continuity from one stage of 
mobilization to another” (1989: 761), FSs are structures of maintenance in times of abeyance. 
These spaces are sites of political, cultural, and biographical outcomes (Giugni 2007, Bosi and Uba 
2009). Feminist movements activities influence products and practices (Rochon 1998), impacting 
local and national trends in education, media, and communication. At the same time, feminist spaces 
keep the movements’ claims and goals effective (Bosi and Uba 2009, Amenta et al. 2010). Their 

43 
 
long-lasting activity and the relation with institutions produce changes on the local and global scales, 
as the cases under investigation will show. Moreover, FSs are sites of analysis to get the long-term 
impact of political activism (Fillieule and Neveau 2019).  
We can assume that all of these spaces are a type of long-term collective action, whose persistence 
requires an analysis capable of going beyond the concepts of contentious politics, resources, emotions 
or emotional ties alone.  
 
New Social Movements theory and Feminist Movements 
This research is based on a constructivist view, and it focuses on FSs in Italy and Spain. This would 
fall under the definition of new social movements given by Melucci (1980, 1989). By overcoming 
Marxist analysis and functionalist sociology, he tries to deal with “the necessity of a sociology of 
collective  action  which  is  capable  of  linking  actors  and  system,  class  relations  and  incidents  of 
conflict” (1980: 201). However, the assumption that the “defense of the identity, continuity, and 
predictability of personal existence is beginning to constitute the substance of the new conflicts” 
(1980: 2018) sometimes seems to have taken an unvoluntary turn. Far from the sociological proposal 
of Melucci (1980, 1989), Touraine (1975) and Pizzorno (1966), the unintended consequences of this 
brilliant turn in the discipline, sometimes called post-materialism (Inglehart 1977), have been the 
crushing of analysis on the individual dimension and identity, the relative loss of the materialist 
element  that  guides  and  informs  the  action  of  the  new  social  movements,  the  prevalence  of  the 
symbolic and cultural element, a certain delegation of the sphere of the emotions to the domain of 
psychology. As Åhäll argues: 
Feminism is often simplistically assumed to be “only” about women’s lives and experiences, 
about “identity politics.” However, as Marysia Zalewski points out, it is more appropriate to think 
of feminism as primarily concerned with the kinds of questions that are fundamentally about how 
the world works (Zalewski 2015, 4). (2018: 41) 
 
This research attempts to analyse the so-called new social movements through the case of FSs by 
taking into account the materialist dimension, developed by feminist theory (Dalla Costa and James 
1975, Picchio 1992, Fraser and Honnet 2007, Del Re 2012, Fraser, Arruzza and Bhattacharya 2019), 
as well as the subversion of codes, symbols and culture (Bono and Kemp 1991, Butler 2002, Bracke 
2014). Starting from the epistemological revolution proposed by the movements, i.e. the politicisation 
of the personal and the rupture between public and private (Melucci 1980, Bono and Kemp 1991), 
the analysis aims to identify how feminist movements question the system of production (Della Costa 
and James 1975, Walters 1995, Casalini 2017), the structure of class relations in society (MacKinnon 
1982, Khun and Wolpe 2013), the social structure, institutionalised norms and social roles (Butler 
1993,  2002).  The  search  for  a  safer  space  is  inquired  through  the  relation  between  agency  and 

44 
 
structures (Jasper 2004): rather than an attempt to carve out spaces of liveability in the contemporary 
world, I will try to analyse the production of safer spaces as a collective action aimed at dismantling 
the economic model and the social systems that determine differential modes of access to citizenship, 
urban space and public life (Prieur 2015, Roestone Collective 2015). In this sense, affect will be 
treated as a field of political reinvention, beyond the codes and rituals identified in the literature on 
social movements. Affects, as I will further explore in the next section, are analysed as a source of 
interpersonal  relations  that  not  only  transform  subjectivities,  but  also  increase  the  potential  for 
collective  action,  by  opening  up  spaces  for  negotiation  and  subversion  of  social  norms  that  are 
difficult to negotiate through other channels (Gregg and Seigworth 2010).  
 
The Epistemological Challenge of Feminist Movements  
The second gap in the literature to address is related to the relative lack of reception of the challenge 
that feminist movements have put forward with respect to a number of concepts developed by social 
movement studies. A range of scholars have brought the case of feminist movements in the literature 
on social movements (Melucci 1980, 1989, Taylor 1989, 1995, 2013, Taylor and Rupp 1989, 1993, 
Taylor and Whittier 1992, Whittier 1997, 2011, Staggenborg 1989, 1995, 2001, 1996, 1998; Marx 
Feree and Martin 1995, West and Blumerg 1990, Ray 1999, Pelak, Taylor and Whittier 2000, Naples 
1998). Taylor (1989; 2000), Rupp and Taylor (1999), and Taylor, Kimport, Van Dyke and Anderson 
(2009) emphasise the leading role of women’s movements toward democratisation. Theorists has 
examined  feminist  movements  not  just  as  one  more  movement  among  others,  but  as  a  social 
phenomenon with specific concepts, models, and repertoires of action, which often challenge the 
concepts developed by social movement studies tout court. However, this literature has been mainly 
US-based,  with  a  lack  of  understanding  on  European  and  postcolonial  countries.  Moreover,  the 
literature went in depth into the so-called second wave of feminism, but it sometimes lacks a closer 
view on contemporary feminist movements and their challenges.  
As historically excluded from the sphere of the political, the activation of women represents the 
unforeseen element of democracy (Loraux 1991, 1994, Spivak 1999, Scott 2011, Cavarero 1995 and 
Castelli  2013).  The  subversion  proposed  by  feminism  in  the  1970s  addressed  social  structures, 
conceptual elaborations, and patterns of thought considered purely masculine: “we spit on Hegel” 
(Lonzi 1974). With this lapidary phrase they intended to propose an epistemological reversal, which 
rejected male-based social paradigms. They refused to identify, think, and act through male-based 
concepts and interpretations (De Beauvoir 2010, Cavarero and Restaino 2002). Feminism paved the 
way  for  an  epistemic  field  and  collective  action  based  on  women's  relationships  and  thinking 
(Cavarero and Restaino 2002). Through consciousness rising group, they intended to start from the 

45 
 
zero degree  of  knowledge  and  political  practice,  inventing  a  new  social  world.  “Women  came 
together in consciousness-raising groups and experienced community, discovery, exhilaration, and 
‘the sheer intellectual excitement of reexamining all received wisdom’ (Rosen 2000: 200). Armed 
with a new consciousness, feminists took to the streets with all kinds of protests designed to challenge 
public assumptions, alter cultural institutions, and create political change” (Staggenbord and Taylor 
2005: 37). Yet, if studies on social movements have not really taken up this radical challenge of 
feminist thought, some scholars have proposed the reworking of concepts that are insufficient to grasp 
the case of feminist movements.  
 
Bridging Gender Studies and Feminist Theory to Social Movement Studies  
Gender is a key factor in the organisation of the social structure. It shapes economic, political, and 
social spheres (Wollstonecraft 2008, Scott 1986, Piccone Stella and Saraceno 1996, Butler 2002, 
Firestone 2003). In 1999 Taylor, but also others before (Blee 1996, 1998, Marx Ferree and Martin 
1995, Naples 1998, Ray 1999), singled out how gender has been largely ignored in the field of social 
movement studies and political sociology, while “a growing body of feminist research demonstrates 
that gender is an explanatory factor in the emergence, nature, and outcomes of all social movements” 
(Taylor 1999: 8). Taylor highlights the enduring gendered dimension of “the mobilization, leadership 
patterns, strategies, ideologies, and even the outcomes of social movement” (1999: 9). By analysing 
postpartum  support  group  movement,  she  delineates  how  gender  relates  to  political  and  social 
context, how it mobilises structures and strategies, collective frames and identities. According to a 
multilevel understanding, gender organises social life through socialisation and sex categorisation 
(interactional level) (West and Zimmerman 1987); gender hierarchies shape the socioeconomic field, 
the labour market and state policies (structural level) (Taylor 1999, Dalla Costa and James 1975); 
gender is embedded in symbolic codes, ideology, and practice of institutions (Taylor 1999, Piccone 
Stella and Saraceno 1996). All these aspects are involved in the emergence, organisation, frames, and 
action of social movements, both at actors’ and structure’s levels.  
Nicholas and Agius (2017) recently described how masculinism still shape global articulations of 
discourses, culture, and politics. Male violence is embedded in the construction of gender: it produces 
a double socialisation between men and women, a binary production of gender and the subordination 
of the latter in all spheres of social life (Russo and Pirlott 2006). In this sense, feminist movements 
aim to attack power and its forms of expression by identifying the root, and therefore the source, of 
social norms and structures (Bono and Kemp 1991, Bracke 2014). “One may therefore speak of a 
class  organizational  movement  when  the  collective  action  within  an  organization  not  only  goes 
beyond the limits of the organization and contests its norms but also attacks the source itself of power” 

46 
 
(Melucci 1980: 204). For this reason, the production of safer spaces is a social process based on the 
subversion of the economic, social, and cultural power that produces women, lesbians, trans, and non-
binary people as subalterns, and steadily included in a differential manner in public and private life 
(Wolf 1993, Prieur 2015, Roestone Collective 2015).  
Reflections on intersectionality opened up the scope of the analysis by stressing out the intersecting 
axis of power which individuals are composed of (Crenshaw 1991, Yuval-Davis 2006). Gender, age, 
ethnicity, class, and age define possibilities, boundaries, and frictions for subjects (Combahee River 
Collective 1977, Smith 1986, hooks 1991). The intersectional approach has been operationalised to 
grasp the way social movements mobilise, their internal structure, their organisations and tactics, 
composition  and  goals  (Choo  and  Marx  Feree  2010,  Lépinard  2020).  The  contribution  to  social 
movement studies expands both the comprehension of political subjectivities and the field of alliances 
(Ciccia, della Porta and Pavan 2021).  
At the identity level, scholars working on feminist movements underline the definition of politicised 
identities by drawing attention on “the development of a consciousness of the group’s distinct” and 
“the politicization of everyday life, embodied in symbols and actions that connect the members of 
the group and link their everyday experiences to larger social injustices” (Rupp and Taylor 1999: 
365). By relying on two features of the movement – self-consciousness rising and the personal as 
political – these scholars single out feminism as a political identity which encompass and broaden 
cognitive liberation (McAdam 1982) and collective identity (Taylor and Whittier 1992). Although 
these reflections have the merit of identifying the work of awareness and the construction of the 
political perimeter of a subaltern group, the concept of identity recalls a stable configuration that 
sometimes does not allow the complexity of the paths of political subjectivation to be grasped. For 
this reason, in the research I will refer less to the concept of identity and more to that of the acquisition 
of awareness, as a process that allows the construction of a dynamic and relational self in relation to 
certain social structures. This perspective helps better to grasp the process of construction of safer 
spaces, which are not places that reverse the male-based world but rather places not entirely codified 
that in the elaboration of alternative structures of feelings continually bring into play representations, 
self-narratives, memberships, visions. 
An extensive literature on organisation sheds light on feminist movements as sources of innovation, 
on  one  hand  through  informal  and  decentralised  structures  that  enhance  strategic  and  tactical 
innovation,  and  on  the  other  through  formalised  and  centralised  structures  which  favour 
organisational maintenance (Staggenborg 1989). These specificities occur in movements aimed at 
“fostering democratic and caring kinds of organizations that empower participants” (Staggenborg 

47 
 
1995:  339).  As  such,  they  are  studied  as  “carriers  of  ‘participatory  democratic’  mode  of  social 
movement organization since the 1960s” (ibidem).   
The notion of repertoire of action (Tilly 1978, McAdam 1982, Tarrow 1998) refers to the limited 
modes  of  claim-making  social  movements  engage  with  and  the  constrained  range  of  innovation 
available in a pre-established set of cultural settings. By broadening the scope of analysis and claim-
making performances to feminist and LGBT movements, scholars highlight an uneven wide range of 
repertoire of action: “social movements often adapt, create, and use culture—ritual, music, street 
theatre, art, the Internet, and practices of everyday life—to make collective claims” (Taylor, Kimport, 
Van Dyke and Anderson 2009: 866). This broader scope will be crucial for the analysis of feminist 
spaces, which action and direct social action offer a compelling case for the developing of the notion 
of repertoire of action (Barone and Bonu forthcoming).  
By overcoming a heavily US-based analysis, and by drawing attention on contemporary feminist 
movements  (Casalini  2017,  Cirimele  and  Panariello  2018,  Chironi  2019,  Barone  and  Bonu 
forthcoming), this research aims at questioning some blind spots of social movements literature, on 
contentious politics, agency and structure, emotions and affects, everyday life activism, biographical 
outcomes, political outcomes. Albeit partial and necessarily limited, it aims to refer to both literatures, 
trying to take up the challenge proposed by feminist movements to social sciences.  
 
 
2.3 Emotions, Affect Theory and Social Movements  
 
Affect as promise: increases in capacities to act (expansions in affectability: both  
to affect and to be affected), the start of ‘‘being-capable’’ [...],  
resonant affinities of body and world, being open to more life or more to life.  
(Gregg and Seigworth 2010: 12) 
 
Emotions and Social Movements  
In  the  previous  section,  I  went  through  the  main  traditions  of  thought  in  the  study  of  social 
movements.  Collective  behaviour,  mobilisation  of  resources,  political  opportunity  structure, 
identities, new social movements, are just a few of the concepts elaborated in order to understand 
how  people  mobilise,  participate,  organise,  perform  action,  and  formulate  claims,  strategies  and 
outcomes. Yet, emotions were until a certain point almost completely neglected. When taken into 
consideration, emotions were only regarded as frightening, incompatible with rationality or, in other 
cases, as falling within the competence of psychology. The innovative work of Hochschild (1983) 
proposed  the  term  “emotional  labour”  to  address  the  process  of  transforming,  channelling  and 

48 
 
managing emotions in order to improve social networks that social movements will be built upon. At 
the turn of the century, the work of Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta (2001) shed light on the missing 
link with sociology of emotions and, more generally, to the role of emotions in collective action: 
“Emotions are important in all phases of political action, by all types of political actors, across a 
variety  of  institutional  arenas”  (Polletta  and  Jasper  2001:  16).  In  2002,  the  special  issue  on 
Mobilization edited by Aminzade and McAdam, proposed several analyses of “the role of emotions 
in sustaining movements over time, the complex and often contradictory nature of emotion work 
within movements, and the activities that produce the emotional energy needed to forge and maintain 
collective  political  identities”  (107).  In  the  attempt  to  clarify  how  different  emotions  work  in 
collective action, Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta suggest a classification based on “immediate reflex 
emotions, longer-term affective commitments, moods and emotions based on complex moral and 
cognitive  understandings”  (2004:  414).  Emotions  such  as  fear,  surprise,  anger,  disgust,  joy,  and 
sadness can arise suddenly, and they provoke instinctive reactions. These types of emotions can 
constitute a trigger for participation (e.g., in the case of the victory of a movement which produces a 
sudden joy and a willingness to participate) (Lofland 1982). Other emotions have longer effects, such 
as love and hate, respect and trust (Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta 2004). The feeling of loyalty for the 
nation  can  be  a  powerful  source  of  political  participation  over  time  (Anderson  1991)  and,  more 
generally, trust is a positive affect which comes from collective identity and strengthens people’s 
engagement (Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta 2004, Mishra 1996). Works on the women’s movement 
show how people are more emotionally satisfied than those participating into mainstream institutions, 
because of the bond of trust, love, and mutual respect (Epstein 1991, Whittier 1995). Instead, moods 
are modular emotions which bring people from one situation to another. Finally, moral emotions are 
“the  largest  group  of  emotions  [that]  arise  out  of  complex  cognitive  understandings  and  moral 
awareness, reflecting our comprehension of the world around us and sometimes of our place in it” 
(Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta 2004: 422).  
Feminist organisations have been a compelling case for the analysis of the relation between emotions 
and collective action (Marx Ferree and Martin 1995, Taylor and Rupp 1993, Taylor 1996, 1999, 
Taylor and Whittier 1998). Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta observe how among sociologists, feminist 
theorists have been able to call into question emotions in their double potential: “women’s political 
claims are more frequently dismissed as ‘merely emotional’ than men’s, they have shown; at the same 
time,  women’s  expression  of  ‘outlaw  emotions’  can  become  the  basis  for  powerful  political 
challenges. Emotions can be strategically used by activists and be the basis for strategic thought” 
(2001: 9). Emotions can be the glue that connects people to each other (Polletta and Jasper 2001). 
They range from affective ties (as love, hate, and so on) to feelings of anger or depression. In their 

49 
 
work on transnational women’s organisations from 1888 to 1945, Taylor and Rupp (2002) shed light 
on the emotion culture which allowed feminist organisations to build solidarity over time and across 
national  borders.  They  use  the  notions  of  gendered  emotion  culture  to  address  those  emotional 
mechanisms that connect, from a feminist perspective, emotion to collective action. In their analysis, 
the  production  of  a  loving  community  works  through  “fashioning expressive  public  rituals of 
reconciliation; forming intense affective ties in the form of international friendships and family-like 
relationships; and drawing on the emotional template of mother love as a universal bond” (Taylor 
and Rupp 2002: 142).  
According to the social-structural tradition and Kemper’s (2001) arguments, emotion is also about 
power, and feelings depend on one’s position in social hierarchies. In order to analyse FSs, it is 
worthwhile referring to emotions as socially and cultural constructed. More frequently, I will refer to 
social rules and political deviation, tension between private and public domains, collective learning 
processes  (Jasper  1998),  the  “fever”  of  collective  mobilisations  (Polletta  2009),  fulfilment  or 
frustration of political engagement.  
Yet, despite the great effort scholars have poured toward a convincing approach to social movements 
that comprises emotions, they somehow focus on emotions as something that merely enriches or 
empowers  collective  action.  Through  a  general  assessment  on  the  study  of  emotions  and  social 
movements, Ruiz-Junco argues that “the contributions of this literature come mainly from theoretical 
crosspollination based on preexisting perspectives in the field of social movements and protest. Some 
of the most widespread concepts, such as emotion work, channeling, emotional framing, emotional 
cultures,  emotional  resonance  and  emotional  opportunity  structures,  stand  precisely  as  a  direct 
outgrowth of long-standing perspectives in the field, such as framing and political process” (2013: 
51). The author calls for a greater attention to the wide scope of emotions, beyond the dominant ones 
reported by activists (such as fear, hostility, and joy), but also beyond a purely overlap of pre-existing 
concepts with the field of emotions. Moreover, she calls for a critical assessment of methods of 
research of emotions. Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta argue that “once we see emotions as, for the most 
part, cultural accomplishments rather than automatic physiological responses we can treat them as 
normal variables or mechanisms in our models of social movements” (2004: 416). According to this 
view, the analysis of emotions risks falling into a purely rational and therefore disembodied view of 
politics, which fails to understand emotions as flows that produce concatenations of bodies, and in 
the transmission, greater or lesser power (Gould 2009). It is also missing the way emotions connect 
the micro, meso, and macro politics; the differences between affect and emotions; the role of affect 
between cognition and body; affect as tools and mediation to develop collective action.  

50 
 
A different and very convincing interpretation of emotions and collective action is given by Deborah 
Gould in her research work on ACT UP and the fight against AIDS. At the outset, Gould realised that 
political process theory was unable to explain the emergence and effectiveness of ACT UP – the 
political opportunity structure was, in fact, very unfavourable towards gay and lesbian subjectivities 
and towards the spread of the AIDS pandemic. In the search for an alternative explanation, she 
plunged into “the emotional saturated of lesbian and gay discourses about AIDS” (2009:12). Through 
the  analysis  of  this  saturation,  she  defined  affect,  emotion,  and  feeling  in  order  to  work  on  the 
potential for collective action. By building on Gould’s remarkable findings, I will engage with the 
work of affects and emotions in FSs. What do emotions politically do? How are emotions embedded 
into  collective  action?  Which  concatenation  of  bodies  and  actions  can  emotions  contribute to 
produce? As long as we broaden the scope of our understanding of emotions, scholars suggest the 
use of the concept of affect.  
 
Spinoza and Affect Theory 
In this section, I will explore the concept of affect and the difference with emotions according to 1) 
affect  as  transmission  of  gradient  of  intensities  between  bodies,  spaces,  and  objects  beyond  an 
individual-based analysis of emotions; 2) affect as mediation between cognition and body; 3) affect 
as the increase of the potential for action. To enucleate this understanding of affect, I will build on a 
post-structuralist approach to the work of Spinoza (Deleuze 2010, Massumi 2015), informed, and 
sometimes  contested,  by  the  work  of  feminist  theorists  and  their  concern  with  subjectivities 
(Sedgwick 2003, Cvetkovich 2003, Berlant 1997, 2008, Ahmed 2004, 2010, Grosz 2004, Hemmings 
2005).  
The so-called affective turn began in 1995, when two compelling books, Eve Sedgwick and Adam 
Frank’s Shame & Its Sisters: A Silvan Tomkins Reader and Brian Massumi’s The Autonomy of Affect 
were published. Affect emerges as a concept to grasp the transmission of intensities among bodies, 
spaces, objects, beyond the individual-based analysis of emotions: “affect arises in the midst of in-
between-ness: in the capacities to act and be acted upon” (Gregg and Seigworth 2010: 1). A number 
of authors dissatisfied with the dominant paradigms of the social sciences and humanities began to 
investigate the field of affects as a source for understanding the social world. Silvan Tomkins, a 
psychologist, in 1962 anticipated some aspects of the theory through a quasi-Darwinian definition of 
affect  as  a  biological  portion  of  emotion.  Not  surprisingly,  the  theory  is  currently  developed  in 
neurosciences, neurobiology, and more generally hard sciences. However, the theory takes different 
meanings and applications depending on the discipline.  

51 
 
I refer to those streams of thought, in social sciences, philosophy, sociology, and cultural studies 
which detect the concept of affect from the work of Spinoza. In Parts Two and Three of his Ethics, 
Spinoza defines affects as the variation of states of mind and body produced by an interaction with 
another body/mind which increases or diminished, aids or restrains the body’s power of activity 
(potentia agendi) (Curley 1994). As he argues, “no one has yet determined what the body can do” 
(1959: 87). Affects are not precisely the same as feelings and emotions. He first categorises three 
primary types of affects: laetitia (which is pleasure or joy), tristitia (pain or discomfort), cupiditas 
(desire). Despite affects being somehow hard to define, Spinoza pursues a further categorisation into 
48 forms of affects, almost entirely included in the three main types. By joy he understands that 
passion by which the mind reaches a greater perfection, while sadness is a passage to a lesser state of 
perfection. He distinguishes between actions and passions, where the former are a type of affect 
located within ourselves, and the latter are a type of affect caused by something that lies outside of 
ourselves. Love (one of the 48 forms of affects) is joy accompanied by an awareness of the external 
reason that causes the passage to a greater perfection. The essence of any human being is the conatus, 
which means the strife to preserve ourselves. So, as Carlisle (2011) highlights: 
joy and sadness, and also their variations, can be either active or passive, depending on whether 
or not the individual is aware of them and understands them clearly. [...] Understanding involves 
knowledge of causation: we need to figure out what gives rise to different feelings – and this 
might be a complex combination of external influences and things that follow from our own 
nature. Without such knowledge, we simply suffer our emotions, but understanding them has a 
transformative effect: "An emotion which is a passion, ceases to be a passion, as soon as we form 
a clear and distinct idea of it." When the mind knows thoroughly even a painful emotion such as 
sadness or grief, its activity of knowing signals an increase of power, which generates a feeling 
of joy
2
.  
 
The  ethic  of  self-empowerment  in  capitalist  and  neoliberal  systems  has  become  often  tied  to 
individualism. Yet, Spinoza draws attention to the connection between each other, which makes us 
only  relatively  autonomous.  While  people  tend  to  maximise joy,  negative  affects  can  never  be 
eliminated. However, people can improve their awareness of external causes of affects, and this way 
of understanding emotions has transformative effects. Spinoza calls it virtue, which in this research 
will take the name of work on affect, pursued by FSs. Virtue consists in the pursuit of understanding 
and knowledge. Which, ultimately, leads to autonomy, freedom, and happiness. According to Gregg 
and Seigworth: 
Affect is found in those intensities that pass body to body (human, nonhuman, part-body, and 
otherwise), in those resonances that circulate about, between, and sometimes stick to bodies and 
worlds,  and  in  the  very  passages  or  variations  between  these  intensities  and  resonances 
themselves. Affect [...] is the name we give to those forces—visceral forces beneath, alongside,

or generally other than conscious knowing, vital forces insisting beyond emotion—that can serve 
to drive us toward movement, toward thought and extension, that can likewise suspend us (as if 
in  neutral)  across  a  barely  registering  accretion  of  force-relations,  or  that  can  even  leave  us 
overwhelmed by the world’s apparent intractability. Indeed, affect is persistent proof of a body’s 
never less than ongoing immersion in and among the world’s obstinacies and rhythms, its refusals 
as much as its invitations. (2010: 1) 
 
In their work, Deleuze and Guattari shed light on the way affects produce a concatenation of bodies 
and  collective  intelligences  (Bertelsen  and  Murphie  2010).  Two  elements  characterise affect:  it 
always involves more than one body and the field of force-relations where the body lies, and what a 
body  can  do  (Deleuze  2010).  While  in  social  movement  studies  collective  identity  and  class 
composition  are  widespread  concepts,  they  fail  to  acknowledge  the  way  affects  produce 
concatenations  of  bodies/minds,  which  are  certainly  more  ineffable  and  difficult  to  measure 
empirically. Yet, this research aims to grasp precisely this nexus between bodies/minds and affects. 
The nexus is often composed of a dark side, a “twilight zone” (Massumi 2015), where some processes 
seem unspeakable. However, I am persuaded that these grey and unspeakable areas have relevant 
hints to add to our comprehension of collective action.  
The  reception  of  Spinoza's  thought  in  the  social  sciences  and  humanities  has  resulted  in  a 
development of the concept of affect. In the first comprehensive reader of the application of affect 
theory, Gregg and Seigworth define affects as “a gradient of bodily capacity” (2010: 2), meaning an 
increase  or  decrease  of  force-relations,  shaped  by  form  of  encounters  but  also  sensation  and 
sensibility. A proliferation of books, special issues, and conferences addressed the application of 
affect theory to the social world. In their theory reading, Gregg and Seigworth outline eight regions 
of investigation in the affect theory: from hard sciences to feminist theory, post-structuralism and 
cultural  studies;  from  psychology  and  psychoanalysis,  to  queer  and  subaltern  perspectives;  from 
critical discourse to pluralist perspectives on materialism. These main regions of inquiry have been 
applied to several fields, such as international relations, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy. In 
their work on affective society, Slaby and von Scheve (2019) elaborate on affect theory in the field 
of social and political life, by closely looking at migration, populism, inequalities. However, apart 
from  some  enlightening  work  (Gould  2009),  a  clear  link  with  social  movements  studies  is  still 
missing. In the next section, I will explore the bridge between affect theory and feminist theory. 
Finally, I will try to enucleate this research’s proposal to fully engage with affect theory in the study 
of feminist collective action, and beyond.   
 
Affect Theory and Feminist Theory 

53 
 
This section aims to identify the contribution of feminist theory in the field of affect studies. In their 
overview of feminist theory and affect turn, Pedwell and Whitehead (2012) question the link, by 
opening  a  reflection  on  positive  consequences  and  risks  (such  as  depoliticisation  or  an  over-
interpretation of individuals).  
To begin with, one of the two texts which are considered the spark of the affective turn is Sedgwick 
and Frank’s contribution in the book Shame & Its Sisters: A Silvan Tomkins Reader (1995). In the 
text, the authors make available the work of the psychologist Tomkins, in order to build a theory of 
affect capable to account for power, bodies, and emotions. Kosofsky Sedgwick is one of the most 
influential scholars in the field of queer and feminist studies, and she keeps engaging with affect, 
performativity, and pedagogy in all of her theoretical work. In 2003, she clarifies her understanding 
of affect, as necessary “to accessing life that exceeds the social regulation of our existence” (Pedwell 
and Whitehead 2012: 117). In works like Time Travels: Feminism, Nature, Power, Elizabeth Grosz 
calls for an analysis of “imperceptibility,” that goes beyond regimes of body domination, and allows 
feminists to develop a “politics of acts, not identities” (Grosz in Pedwell and Whitehead 2004b: 186). 
Another influential scholar in the field of feminism and affect theory was Lauren Berlant. In her work, 
she suggested the idea of an intimate public sphere, as the way the public sphere is produced by 
prescriptions on sexuality, intimacy, and the body (1991, 1993).  
A range of scholars in the field of feminist theory pursued the bridge with affect theory (Cvetkovich 
2003, Butler 1997, Berlant 1997, 2008, Ahmed 2004, 2010, Hemmings 2005, 2011). As Pedwell and 
Whitehead argue, “feminist scholars have been at the heart of these engagements with affect, in part, 
because,  for  some, feminism  itself  is  a  politics  ‘suffused  with  feelings,  passions  and  emotions’ 
(Gorton  2007:  333),  but  also  one  that  has  long  recognised  the  critical  links  between  affect  and 
gendered, sexualised, racialised and classed relations of power” (2012: 115-116). Feminist scholars 
refer to the Marxist tradition, psychoanalysis, post-structuralism, and sociology in order to explore 
“the way feeling is negotiated in the public sphere and experienced through the body” (Gorton 2007: 
334).  
Two influential critics, coming from feminist theorists, highlight the way narratives on the newness 
of the affective turn can hide or remove feminist efforts in knowledge production. Hemmings (2005, 
2011,  2012)  argues  against  the  misleading  rhetoric  of  affect  theory  as  ground-breaking,  which 
overshadows postcolonial and feminist theories. By also arguing against those narratives of “loss” 
and “return” of feminism, she calls for a careful genealogy of epistemology. Cvetkovich addresses 
affect theory’s removal of the outcomes of the feminist mantra “the personal is political,” which in 
earlier times had led to similar findings (2012).  

54 
 
The knot of knowledge, power, and affect has always been the question raised by feminist movements 
and theory. More than claiming for a truth which can be accessed through empathy and affective ties, 
feminist theorists elaborate on the way the field of affect is embedded with power and knowledge, 
and how it can be negotiated, contested, subverted. However, emotions are a challenging field from 
a feminist perspective, because of the dichotomy rationality/emotion women have been trapped in. 
According to the classical definition of politics (Cavarero 1995) and the critical interpretation by 
feminist scholars, such as Loraux (1991, 1994), Spivak (1999), Scott (2011), Cavarero (1995) and 
Castelli  (2015),  the  Athenian  polis  arose  through  the  act  of  defining  what  is  political,  rational, 
legitimate, accountable, and what is “the other” (Loraux 1991). The other of politics are women. The 
body and emotions are the opposite of politics, and women are mainly bodies and emotions. Women 
are considered as carriers of love, care, affects, instinct, contention, disorder (Cavarero 1995; Loreaux 
1994). Closer to animals than the Greek idea of mankind, women have to be controlled and repressed, 
in order to reduce their destabilising impact on Athenian politics. That is how dichotomic definitions 
emerge,  as  pairs  of  opposite:  women/men,  rational/passionate,  politics/affections,  public/private, 
institutions/bodies (Loraux 1994, Castelli 2015, Scott 2011). Recovering the field of affect from a 
feminist perspective has meant to question the field of the political and that of women's subjectivity.  
In 2004, Ahmed articulated a critic of the cultural politics of emotions. Affect, power, and knowledge 
are investigated through some events, such as the 11 September 2001 and the so-called war on terror, 
or the abduction of generations of indigenous children in Australia toward their “inclusion” and 
civilisation.  She  looks  at  affects  as  sticky  objects  that  work  through  repetition.  The  affects  she 
engages with are pain, hate, fear, disgust, shame, love, queer feelings, and feminist attachments. The 
movement  between  signs  and  objects  produces  surfaces  of  bodies,  which  perceive  emotions 
depending on social meanings and position in the social structure. As I will further develop in the 
next section, Ahmed proposes a toolkit which is likely to deepen our knowledge on the way social 
movements work.  
Authors like Audre Lorde (1984) and Marion Young (1990) contend the way oppression is shaped 
and carried out at the affective level. Thus, the field of affect is imbricated with gender, sex, race, 
age.  
Emotions  involve  bodily  processes  of  affecting  and  being  affected,  but  [...]  affect  is  not 
something prepersonal that flows between bodies in a generic sense. Rather, some bodies generate 
different affective responses in a particular context than others. Certain (gendered, raced, sexed) 
subjects therefore become the objects of others’ affective responses. This is how emotions are a 
matter of how we come into contact with objects and others. (Ahäll 2018: 38) 
 
Feminist studies differ from gender studies for the analysis of politics, which is always an analysis of 
power. “Thus, a feminist approach to the politics of emotion through gender is about how we become 

55 
 
invested in social norms, it is about the affective investments in gender as a social norm” (Ahäll 2018: 
41). As Hemmings argues, it is the “question of affect — misery, rage, passion, pleasure — that gives 
feminism its life” (2012: 150). Thus, the analysis of affect from a feminist perspective requires both 
a change in the epistemological framework and in methodology. The claim for situated knowledge 
(Haraway 1988) and the politics of location is here bridged by another claim: “In order to know 
differently we have to feel differently” (Hemmings 2012: 150).  
This research explores the way affects are embedded in, mediated, negotiated, and put into action by 
feminist  spaces  through  the  concept  of  safer  spaces.  I  will  specifically  engage  with  the  blurred 
distinction between emotions and affects, with the way bodies perceive and are affected by affects, 
and by the transformative effects consequent to a conscious work on affects. However, this research 
aims to avoid the risk of an individual-based analysis, by detecting the way affects relate to collective 
action. How do affects relate to social movements? How do they produce a concatenation of bodies? 
What findings do we get from a look at the work of affects, through the “twilight zone”? In the next 
section, I will try to further develop the fertilisation between affect theory, feminism, and social 
movements.  
 
Bridging Affect Theory to the Study of Social Movements: The Formative Powers of Affect  
I want us to think about forms of politics that seek to contest social norms, in terms of emotion, understood 
as ‘embodied thought’. My concern is not only to think about how one becomes attached to feminism, but 
how feminism involves an emotional response to ‘the world’, where the form of that response involves a 
reorientation of one’s bodily relation to social norms  
(Ahmed 2004: 170-171)  
 
This research aims to explore how emotions and affects flow between bodies, minds, and objects, and 
how  through  this  circulation  they  produce  collective  action  and  potential  for  social  change.  The 
empirical cases of this research are FSs. In these cases, I try to understand which emotions and affects 
they are embedded in, how they circulate, and which consequences they produce. My argument is 
that feminist politics is based on a conscious work on affects, and the capacity of naming, negotiating, 
and reverberating affects has transformative effects.  
Social movement theorists are used to engaging with several concepts to analyse collective action. 
The unintended risk of using these concepts is to refer to a disembodied view of politics, in which 
causal mechanisms work, but they fail to acknowledge the “imperceptibility” (Grosz 2004). The 
circulation of affects and passion have been taken into consideration as the processes through which 
a concatenation of bodies occurs (Deleuze 2010, Massumi 2015). The individual search for those 
things that one thinks will benefit them by increasing their power of acting is here investigated with 
regard to collective actors. The way affect interacts with composition is hard to acknowledge. It 

56 
 
requires an analysis of the “twilight areas” of individuals and collective actors. However, this field is 
not merely a matter of psychology. Social and political structures are imbued with affects, as well as 
social movements.  
Historically,  the  feminist  movements’  production  of  knowledge was  focused  on  “the  thought  of 
experience” (Buttarelli and Giardini 2008). 1970s feminism developed through consciousness raising 
groups,  where  women  voiced  their  experience  in  a  small  consensus.  This  narrative  was  not  a 
narcissistic soliloquy, but rather a common ground of reflection for the group. In this way, women 
developed a common consciousness of oppression, which was not about the malaise of the individual 
but  rather  about  the  structural  and  social  causes  that  produce  women  as  subalterns.  “Women's 
collective action is nourished by these everyday experiences and does not express itself only through 
public mobilizations; it develops through the shared apprenticeship of difference and resistance in 
everyday times, spaces, and relationships” (Melucci 1996: 134). Through the practice of the personal 
as political, feminist groups have developed a capacity to make theoretical abstraction and political 
action  out  of  an  awareness  work  on  emotions.  Consciousness  raising  groups  allowed  women  to 
connect cognition and body through the mediation of affects in order to explore how such emotions 
were  embedded  in  structural  relations  of  power.  According  to  Spinoza’s  stance,  and  to  the 
development of feminist thought, emotions and affects can be investigated as the engine of collective 
action, and the source of its potential. In a way, emotions and affects are the very substance of political 
action. Fear, hate, rage, anger, love, wonder, solidarity, empathy, disgust, desire are not just variables 
embedded  in  collective  action,  but  processes  that  take  place  between  bodies,  cognition,  objects, 
contexts. In the transition between signs and surfaces they shape the conditions of action.  
In her work, Ahmed elaborates a scientific analysis of the grammar of emotions. In The Cultural 
Politics of Emotions (2004), she argues that “emotions are not only about impressions left by others, 
but  that  they  involve  investments  in  social  norms”  (196).  Her  compelling  argument  of  affective 
economies draws on a comparison to Marxian critique of the logic of capital. In his critique, Marx 
shows how the movement of commodity and money works, through the formula M-C-M: money to 
commodity to money, that creates surplus value (Ahmed 2004). Following this logic, “the movement 
between signs and objects converts into affect. [...] Affect does not reside in an object or sign, but is 
an effect of the circulation between objects and signs (= the accumulation of affective value) signs 
increase in affective value as an effect of the movement between signs: the more signs circulate, the 
more affective they become” (Ahmed 2004: 45).  
By analysing the sociality of pain, Ahmed explains how people understand the pain of others because 
they reverberate one’s own pain. However, we cannot “feel” the pain of others, but we can listen to 
them and feel involved with their pain. This process is particularly embedded in feminist politics 

57 
 
since part of the work of acknowledgment concerns the way women, lesbians, trans, and queer people 
are torn apart by gender-based violence and the gender regime. However, this process is not about 
transforming a wound into a collective identity, but rather about transforming emotions into collective 
action. At the same time, fear is a powerful trigger for feminist political subjectivation. As Ahmed 
argues, fear aligns bodies with social space and social norms (2004). Thus, body surfaces are shaped 
by feeling in-place/out-of-place. The choice to build FSs in an urban context is imbued with the 
experience of fear. As Ahmed contends, emotions are not only a matter of the present, but the way 
they affect bodies is a result of historical processes and social norms: “’what sticks’ is bound up with 
the ‘absent presence’ of historicity” (2004: 45).  
By challenging the assumption of love as the foundation for political action, Ahmed argues that we 
must love our visions. “In the resistance to speaking in the name of love, in the recognition that we 
do not simply act out of love, and in the understanding that love comes with conditions however 
unconditional it might feel, we can find perhaps a different kind of line of connection between the 
others we care for, and the world to which we want to give shape” (Ahmed 2004: 141). This definition 
of love in political action resonates with the concept of prefigurative politics, as the attempt to shape 
political spaces and action according to the world that people would aim to inhabit (Yates 2015). 
Nonetheless, Ahmed meets the concept of prefigurative politics with the work of affect, which sticks 
to political action and shapes the repertoire of action and activists’ investment into it. As she argues, 
feminist visions are fuelled by hope, as well: “To express hope for another kind of world, one that is 
unimaginable in the present, is a political action, and it remains so even in the face of exhaustion and 
despair” (2004: 186).  
Focusing on affect also changes our understanding of time and temporalities in collective action 
(Barassi and Zamponi 2020, Gillian and Edwards 2020). We are used to think of time in terms of 
cycles of protest (Tarrow 1993, della Porta 2013), eventful temporalities (Sewell 1996), and abeyance 
(1989). Feminist movements focus on the value of non-chronological time in leading transformative 
future (Barad 2017, Borghi 2020, Walker 2014). Social time was addressed as a male product, since 
it  was  always  targeted  on  male  possibilities,  life  course-trajectories,  expectations.  Male-based 
temporality is considered as linear, deterministic, neutral (Halberstam 2005, Dinshaw et al. 2007). 
Social movements, as well, tend to rely on a male interpretation of time, based on performativity, 
productiveness, efficiency (Scott 2011). On the contrary, for feminist movements the time to protest 
is rooted in situated emotions, expectations, needs (Melandri 2000). It was not public institutions, 
male politics, or traditional political opportunities to “mark time” of feminist politics, but feminist 
activists themselves that defined another temporality, based on women’s needs (Lonzi 1974). Social 

58 
 
movements and feminist studies take into account how challenging a linear conception of time opens 
up new temporalities. 
According to the production of knowledge by feminist movements, the comprehension of collective 
emotions has transformative effects.  
In the last section, I will focus on the last but not least dimension of this research: that of space and 
social movements. 
 
 
2.4 Safer Spaces  
 
The Spatial Turn in Sociology  
Interrelations between objects occur in space and time; it is these relationships themselves which 
create/define space and time.  
(Massey 1992: 79) 
 
The  term  “spatial  turn”  refers  to  a  shift  in  social  sciences  and  humanities  toward  a  different 
understanding of “space.” If space was first understood as a mere scenario in which human actions 
take place, the constructivist approach began to explore space as relationship with the social, which 
is imbued with power. “It is not just that the spatial is socially constructed; the social is spatially 
constructed,  too”  (Massey  1985:  6).  Some  social  movement  scholars  argue that  “the  social 
constitution of space has not received the same amount of attention as the temporal order” (Knoblauch 
and Low 2017: 1). The issue of space as a social phenomenon has been addressed by authors like 
Durkheim (1965), Simmel (2021) and Lefebvre (1991). Only later the dimension of space arises as 
“a relational category based in social interaction and interdependency” (Knoblauch and Low 2017: 
2). Nonetheless, there is still a lack of studies investigating spatiality as socially constructed, but also 
sociality as located in place and space (Nicholls, Miller and Beaumont 2016).  
Social movement scholars explore the relation between spaces and collective action. “All spatialities, 
properly conceived, are relational. These relational spatialities, e.g., place, space, scale, territory, 
networks,  mobility,  play  distinctive  yet  interlocking  roles  in  shaping  the  structures,  strategies, 
dynamics and power of social movements.” (Nicholls, Miller and Beaumont 2016: 2-3). The study 
of contentious politics brought new light on the relevance of space. They try to answer questions 
related to mobilisation capacities, internal conflict, inner cohesion, and so on. Curthis and Zurcher 
(1973),  through  the  concept  of  “multi-organisational  field,”  shed  light  on  the  networks  of 
organisations cooperating during episodes of protest. Staggenborg (1989), on the other hand, studied 
social movement communities as the sites of an area which goes beyond the constituency of the 

59 
 
movement, and includes the recruitment clusters. Giugni and Passy (2000) engaged with the concept 
of a social movement arena, a space in between political parties and citizens, that works as a claim-
envoy from one arena to the other. Duyvendak and Jasper’s (1995) concept of arena differs from the 
latter: arenas are bounded up with rules and resources where different players engage in strategic 
interaction in order to pursue their goals. By referring to Bourdieu’s influence, Fligstein and McAdam 
(2012) elaborate on the strategic action field, where actors interact depending on their goals and the 
rules of the field. In her essay, Mathieu (2021) proposes the concept of the space of social movements, 
which  is  grounded  in  the  abovementioned  literature,  although  it  adds  some  elements.  By  the 
expression “space of social movements,” she means “a universe of practice and meaning that is 
relatively autonomous from other social microcosms [...], and within which mobilizations (and the 
organizations and activists that lead them) are linked by various relations of interdependence” (196).  
If these scholars address the social, political, and economic space where social movements act and 
interact, others specifically focus on space as a physical matter. In the next section, I will explore the 
literature on free spaces, by highlighting similarities and differences with feminist spaces. 
  
Free Spaces, Feminism and Social Movements  
According to Evans and Boyte’s first conceptualisation of free spaces, they are “settings between 
private lives and large-scale institutions where ordinary citizens can act with dignity, independence 
and vision” (1986:17). Evans (1979) highlighted the need for challengers to manage smaller portions 
of public space, called free spaces, to develop collective action frames. For these scholars, free spaces 
bound up resources, alternative futures, and strategies that the oppressed might always put in practice. 
In these spaces, new skills, relationships, networks, and solidarity are built, that prepare or keep the 
ground for mobilisation and movements (Evans and Boyte 1986, Polletta 1999). Polletta’s well-
known definition claims that “free spaces and their analogues refer to small-scale settings within a 
community or movement that are removed from the direct control of dominant groups, are voluntarily 
participated  in,  and  generate  the  cultural  challenge  that  precedes  or  accompanies  political 
mobilization” (1999: 1). Many different names refer to the same concept: free spaces, protected 
spaces, safe spaces, spatial preserves, havens, cultural laboratories. Usually, the notion has been 
applied  in  the  study  of  churches,  cultural  groups,  fraternal  organisations.  Scholars  went  forward 
conceptualising free spaces, and controversies emerged. Free spaces are both physical sites or spaces 
existing in practice, print or virtually; they are considered as sites of counter-hegemonic ideas or not; 
connected to the creation of collective identities (Polleta 1999). Diani (2013) calls these spaces “dense 
subcultural networks,” a separate site of coordination of collective action. As Polletta puts it, “as 
‘movement communities,’ free spaces are an enduring outcome of protest” (1999: 4).  

60 
 
These types of spaces allow social movements to preserve certain cultural frames and autonomous 
organisation.  Scholars  usually  emphasise  the  analysis  of  the  internal  dynamics  of  these  spaces. 
Others, such as Tornberg and Tornberg (2017), engage with the role of free social spaces in mass 
mobilisations and social movements diffusion.  
While FSs comply with some of these insights, they also bring some novelties. According to the 
definition of free spaces, we can assume that they arise in opposition to government surveillance and 
dominant groups. Nonetheless, free spaces do not deal with a generic notion of dominant groups or 
traditional  government.  FSs’  opponent  is  the  male-based  social  structure,  that  ranges  from  the 
production  of  memory,  history,  and  knowledge,  to  the  reproduction  of culture,  to  excluding 
institutions, to sexist education, to difference in the labour market, to family conditions and social 
reproduction. They are makers of claims addressed to more than one recipient: the State, the cultural 
setting, social norms, sexual division of labour. Moreover, it is hard to locate their temporal scan, as 
part of preliminary movements mobilisations or during them. According to Taylor’s reflections on 
women’s movement (1989), we call into question the movement as a continuum on an historical 
perspective.  FSs  are  part  of  this  constant,  and  often  underground,  flow  of  actions,  relationships, 
networks,  claims,  belongings.  As  previously  addressed,  I  will  look  at  FSs  by  going  beyond  the 
concept  of  collective  identity.  Instead,  I  will  explore  these  spaces  as  constantly  produced  and 
transformed through relational effort, the flow of intensities, cognitive and bodily action. FSs come 
to be spaces of belonging because of the effort to produce alternative structures of feelings, though 
this effort is never completely enclosed in the configuration of a stable identity.  
The need for only-women space emerged over time within feminist movements as an answer to 
violence, dispossession, social inequality (Calabrò and Grasso 2004, Melandri 2000). Virginia Woolf, 
in the early 19
th
 century, argued that the independence of a woman is inextricably linked to the 
possession of a certain amount of money and a room of one’s own. Whether Woolf’s room could 
mean an individual separate space of autonomy, within the private domain, feminist movements 
asked wider question about public spaces of liveability.  
The struggle to break the spatial confines of the private (i.e., domestic) sphere and to overcome 
restrictions on mobility experienced by women, has been crucial to the feminist cause. As feminist 
geographers  have  argued,  space  is  constructed  out  of  social relations  which  are  imbued  with 
power, so that to escape the spatial confines of the home by gaining access to the public sphere 
means to free oneself from the restraints of family life and social control. The city is the ultimate 
public sphere and although women’s access to physical, public space is often hindered or socially 
controlled, the city – as Melandri noted with regards to Milan – also “represents a potential space 
for liberation.” (Hajek 2017: 8) 
 
FSs range from self-help centres, to women’s shelters against gender based-violence, to feminist 
bookstores  and  libraries.  All  of  them  seem  to  bring  a  similar  reflection  on  space  and  relational 

61 
 
dimensions.  On  one  hand,  spaces  are  political.  They  arise  in  opposition  to  a  shared  sense  of 
dispossession  and they  aim  to  produce  a  prefigurative  place  of  different  meanings,  behaviours, 
belongings. On the other hand, FSs are grounded in affective ties among women, lesbians, trans, and 
non-binary people. They aim to disrupt male-dominated structures, to perform feminist relationships 
of trust, solidarity, empathy and care. In this framework, this research project addresses the notion of 
safer spaces as a dynamic process where conditions of liveability, comfort, and safety are discussed 
and negotiated among participants.  
Asking what makes a space safer for women, how they become “safe from” (gender-based violence, 
urban dimension, inequalities) through the production of spaces in which being “safer to,” would 
mean taking into account spatiality as a socially and politically constructed subject, and the inner 
relational dimension of spaces. Spaces are socially constructed and embedded with power.  
Engaging with geography of gender and sexuality, we might argue that FSs, according to spatial 
scales perspective, are constructed by sets of interrelations and always simultaneously existing on 
different scales, “from the most local level to the most global” (Massey 1992: 80). Focusing on space 
means taking into consideration all these scales at the same time, from the micro-level of individual 
dimension to the embeddedness with the neoliberal system, transnational governance, and economic 
structures (McDowell 2005).  
FSs are places where it is possible to “forg[e] tight bonds in intimate settings” (Polletta and Kretchmer 
2013, 2). Polletta calls these spaces “prefigurative group created in ongoing movements” (1999: 11).  
It is worth considering women’s movement as an example of prefigurative politics (Rowbotham 
1979, Day 2005, della Porta et al. 2006, Leach 2013, Williams 2016): indeed, it brings together the 
aim of producing counter-hegemonic institutions and “modes of interaction that embody the desired 
transformation”  (Leach  2013:  1).  The  concept  was  developed  through  empirical  cases  such  as 
anarchist and communist movements (Lakey 1968, Bey 1991, Boggs 1977, Day 2005, Polletta 2002) 
and anti-globalisation movements (della Porta et al. 2006), as a way to frame how activists and their 
practices are able (or not) to translate into action their ideological attempt. As such, prefiguration 
means fighting structures of power, dispossession, oppression, inequalities, by making visible at the 
same time a different way to perform social relationships, political practices and decision-making 
processes (Boggs 1977, Bey 1991). According to Boggs’ conceptualisation, prefigurative politics 
refers to the embodiment of the movements’ ideological aims in practice, through a specific shape of 
social  relations,  decision-making,  experiences,  and  culture  (1977).  Rejecting  vanguardism  and 
centralisation of decision-making process, this notion stresses the importance of enacting the world 
as the movements want to change it (Bey 1991). Feminist spaces tend to put in practice what is 
claimed in theory: gender equality, a consensus-based authority structure, participatory democracy, 

62 
 
caring and empathetic activism, self-organised services (Rowbotham 1979, Taylor 1989). As Bey 
(1991) called it, they can be considered as “temporary autonomous zones,” that challenge and subvert 
the structure of the city, of institutional politics, of the male-based system. These spaces are shaped 
by feminist reflections on body, affects, care, health, mutual understanding, conflict. Even though it 
is a process, and not a stable configuration, a prefigurative space produces on a smaller scale the type 
of desired society in opposition to the male-based society of the outside (Williams 2016). Everyday 
activities, such as managing the space, taking care of practical tasks, talking with people coming from 
the outside and welcoming them in the space, organising meetings and activities, become a way to 
model a feminist vision of social change. As Williams calls it (2016), prefigurative politics works on 
three dimensions: personal, organisational, and integrated (combining the personal and organisational 
levels).  Indeed,  she  argues  that  most  scholars  have  focused  on  the  organisational  level,  but  the 
feminist movement required another focus on the personal level, that is on how everyday activities, 
social interaction, collective activities, become the world as they claim it (2016). Polletta (1999) 
argues that prefigurative spaces are difficult to sustain. However, “if they can provide services [...] 
that successfully compete with mainstream service providers, they may become enduring indigenous 
institutions and may supply leaders and participants for later mobilizations” (Polletta 1999: 12). 
As I explored so far, physical spaces allow feminist communities to preserve a sense of belonging, 
cultural frames, organisation, resources and time to elaborate strategies. These spaces prepare for 
mobilisations to come, but they also transform the everyday life politics and biographical trajectories 
of activists. The way spaces are created and are given meaning depends on the communities’ values 
and beliefs. On the other side, a space encourages or drives away people’s capacity to think and act 
collectively. Spaces are made up of bodies, objects, affective bonds, signs. Relations and reflections 
depend on the location of each one within and with respect to the space. Politics is nurtured in 
presence, and presence is mutually built upon and with the physical space. This research engages 
with the notion of space as a relational field where collective actors produce their sense of belonging 
and their strategies for social change. Spaces are explored under the lens of affect: bodies, objects 
and signs exist in the repetition and change of certain meanings. The change of meanings is a result 
of a collective effort to name, unveil, and engage with affects. In this sense, I will look at spaces as 
structures  of  feelings  where  affect  and  emotions  become  the  ground  for  individual  change  and 
collective action. As Spinoza argued, the conscious work on affects has transformative effects.  
 
Safe, Safer, Brave  
Without objects of fear, objects to which we attach uncomfortable affects, the world itself is fearsome. We 
need objects to draw the tension, the affect, so that we can interact with other objects.  
(Stengel 2010:532 in The Roestone Collective 2014) 

63 
 
 
Safe space as a concept has a long history in different fields. It ranges from women’s movement of 
the  late  20
th
 century  to  separatist  spaces  in  feminist,  LGBTQI  and  anti-racist  communities,  to 
inclusive safe spaces related to classrooms (The Roestone Collective 2015). Historically, it appeared 
in movements and pedagogical communities. Each experience refers to a different idea of safe space. 
The term is highly contested, and sharp contradictions are embedded in the very sense of the concept. 
“Safe spaces are inherently paradoxical. Cultivating them includes foregrounding social differences 
and binaries (safe–unsafe, inclusive–exclusive) as well as recognizing the porosity of such binaries. 
Renegotiating these binaries is necessarily incomplete; a safe space is never completely safe.” (The 
Roestone Collective 2015: 1346).  
Through a brief outline of the concept, I will set out the specific strain in the literature in which this 
research is grounded.  
Why do some people need a safe space? What is considered unsafe? From what do some people need 
to be safe, and safe to do what? The need for a safe place is triggered by a context perceived as unsafe, 
and where certain people perceive fear, dangers, or discomfort. To feel “out of place” is a sign that a 
certain place is designed for certain subjects, and anyone who does not have the characteristics of the 
intended subjects tends to feel excluded or marginalised (Pain and Staeheli 2014). “Space [...] does 
not simply exist as a ‘given’ but affects (and is affected by) things which are always becoming. Or, 
to put it another way, space is not just a passive back-drop to human behaviour and social action, but 
is  constantly  produced  and  remade  within  complex  relations  of  culture,  power  and  difference” 
(Hubbard 2001: 51). From an intersectional point of view (Crenshaw 1989, 1991), the perception 
depends on the axes of gender, racialisation, working condition, age, the type of place, and “sticky” 
emotions  (Ahmed  2004)  which,  through  the  repetition  of  signs  and  objects,  associate  certain 
perceptions to certain bodies. Feminist geographers have analysed how space is always gendered and 
socially constructed, and how fear is an emotion that influences women’s behaviours and choices in 
public  and  private  spaces  (Pain  1991,  2001,  Valentine  1989,  Bondi  and  Rose  2003).  Fear  is  a 
consequence of structural violence, an element which produces anxiety more than constant physical 
threat. This anxiety influences the way certain subjects move, act, and perceive spaces (Pain 1991). 
Perceptions of safety/unsafety depend on individual performances and oppressions, and vary a lot 
across  time  and  space.  As  such,  safety/unsafety  are  not  intrinsic  characteristics  but  fluid 
configuration, based on power relations. In a given moment, a space may be unsafe depending on 
gender, race, class, age identification, but also more or less safe by day or by night. The traditional 
distinction  between  private/public  spaces  changes  as  a  consequence  of  embodied  experience.  A 
classic example concerns the household, which was considered by (white) feminisms as the site of 

64 
 
gendered violence and women’s oppression, while Black women considered it a site of resistance 
(hooks 1991). Perceptions of safety/unsafety can be questioned by the collective use of certain spaces, 
such as the marches Take Back the Night, where women reclaim their right to fearlessly inhabit public 
space (Belingardi, Bonu, Castelli and Olcuire 2020).  
The perception of safety is not merely a bodily or emotional matter. Boundaries of spaces are often, 
as in the case of public space and the nation, political boundaries which “bound up” a certain idea of 
citizenship. As Hubbard puts it:  
Those whose sexual proclivities are adjudged suspect, dangerous or undesirable may find their 
civil  and  welfare  rights  curtailed  as  politicians  and  policymakers  seek  to  redefine  the  moral 
boundaries of the nation. For example, discussing the shifting parameters of social policy in the 
United Kingdom, Carabine (1996) highlights the importance of pregnancy, AIDS/HIV, child sex 
abuse, promiscuity, birth control and pornography as issues used to exclude certain individuals 
from  the  rights  and  entitlements  associated  with  full  citizenship.  More  widely,  debates  about 
surrogacy,  embryology  and  the  age  of  consent  continue  to  raise  key  questions  about  what  is 
‘natural’ as western politicians fall back on ideas of biological essentialism to resolve the tension 
between individual freedoms and collective obligations. (2001: 52) 
 
Here, I refer to the double meaning of safety: on one side, as a bodily and emotional field, and on the 
other, as a political field which comprises rights, obligations, and provisions which people have/have 
not access to. From this twofold sphere of meanings originates the reflection of feminist movements. 
There, safe spaces are created as a relational work (the Roestone Collective 2014), where differences 
are not erased but rather prevented to produce “common problems.”  The concept emerged in the 
women’s movement in the late 20
th
 century (Kenney 2001). “In feminist, queer, and civil rights 
movements  an  understanding  of  safe  space  has  developed  that  is  associated  with  keeping 
marginalized groups free from violence and harassment. This type of safe space also encourages ‘a 
certain license to speak and act freely, form collective strength, and generate strategies for resistance’ 
(Kenney 2001: 24)” (The Roestone Collective 2014: 1346). Safe spaces can be an attempt to change 
the nature of threatening spaces, or can be created as separate, autonomous and self-managed spaces. 
This latter type of spaces works as a site of gathering and support among people who share social 
roles and discrimination, and who share similar values and understanding of reality (Day 1999). They 
can be both spaces to recover and spaces to organise resistance (hooks 1990). Quite commonly, 
lesbian communities created separate spaces, which have been also land in rural areas (Valentine 
1999, Schweighofer 2015), with the aim to withdraw from a heterosexist world (Pritchard, Morgan 
and Sedgley 2002, Kenney 2001). On one side, these spaces can be an opportunity to strengthen 
collective identity, to recover and to organise and develop collective action (Duncan 1996). On the 
other, they can risk to reproduce dynamics of inclusion/exclusion, as in the case of trans-exclusionary 
feminist  communities,  or  white  communities  of  women  that  reproduce  the  racialisation  of  other 
women. As scholars put it, they are safer rather than safe: they are “inclusive precisely as they are 

65 
 
exclusive” (the Roestone Collective 2014: 1355). The creation of spaces is a never-ending process 
which cannot be solved once and for all. Some scholars challenge the concept of safety by using the 
word “brave”: these are spaces where marginalised communities fiercely resist, and this effort is not 
defensive but rather bold (Prieur 2015, Arao and Clemens 2013, Ali 2017). Rose (1993) calls them 
paradoxical  spaces,  where  traditional  social  norms  are  challenged,  multiple  differences  come 
together, and identities are embraced and subverted.  
Another use of the notion of safe spaces is embedded in the sector of pedagogy, classrooms and 
teaching activities (Barrett 2010, Hunter 2008, Holley and Steiner 2005, Kaufman 2008, Ludlow 
2004), as a way to produce anti-oppressive education (Kumashiro 2000). Since the 1960s, spreading 
from  the  United  States  to  mainly  Northern  European  countries,  the  classrooms’  safety  has  been 
addressed as a sort of “ethical obligation” for teachers and school administrators (Roestone Collective 
2015; Barrett 2010; Ludlow 2004). The presence of racialised, religious, gender, disabled, minority 
groups within the classrooms became a catalyst for the production of inclusive environments aimed 
at reducing discrimination, exclusions, discomfort, and loneliness. “By acknowledging that ‘no space 
is free from domination’ or risk, teachers and students can constructively explore how issues of 
privilege, power and difference play out in the classroom and in the larger socio-political realm” 
(Roestone Collective 2015: 1355). The creation of a safe environment helps in sharing opinions, 
expressing oneself, building identities, and feeling comfortable in sharing emotions (Barrett 2010). 
Even though widely spread, the metaphor of the classroom as a safe space has been highly criticised. 
Boomstrom (1998) argues that the mission of higher education is intellectual development and critical 
thinking, precisely the opposite of a protected space from risks and dangers. 
 When everyone’s voice is accepted and no one’s voice can be criticized, then no one can grow. 
[...] We need to hear other voices to grow is certainly true, but we also need to be able to respond 
to those voices, to criticize them, to challenge them, to sharpen our own perspectives through the 
friction  of  dialogue.  [...]  We  have  to  be  brave  because  along  the  way  we  are  going  to  be 
“vulnerable and exposed”; we are going to encounter images that are “alienating and shocking.” 
We are going to be very unsafe. (Boostrom 1998: 407) 
 
 Ludlow (2004) and Frusciante (2008) as well, stress the unrealistic and dangerous effort to produce 
a protected space for marginalised group, while the world outside that space remain deeply racist, 
sexist, ableist, classist, heteronormative.  
The notion of “safe space” is too wide to use as an umbrella term. Safe spaces are always situated in 
a given time and space, depending on their composition and structure. That is why, at the end of this 
overview, it is worth underlining that this research focuses on a specific type of safe space, beyond 
this  heterogeneous  genealogy,  that  is  feminist  physical  and  political  spaces  that  call  themselves 
“safer.” This research is not intended to propose a definitive reading of safer spaces, but to add a 
piece of interpretation based on affects. The recourse to the definition of safer spaces will in fact be 

66 
 
analysed as the manifestation of a deeper process concerning the emotional infrastructure at the basis 
of feminist spaces. Participants refer to safety and the creation of safer spaces as a consequence of 
the creation of structures of feelings in which emotions are named and discussed, serve as tools for 
political elaboration, and function as competences in collective action. Safety is thus a consequence 
of this familiarity with emotions, which allows access to a side often hidden or removed from public 
life and social interactions, which is that of feeling and acting through feeling.  
As Barrett argues, the term has become “overused but undertheorized metaphor” (2010: 1). In order 
to contribute to the literature on safe spaces in feminist communities, I will engage with an in-depth 
analysis of practices, words, and emotions involved in the re-articulation of safer spaces in the urban 
contexts of Rome and Madrid.  
 
2.5 Conclusion  
 
In the previous section, I explored the literature on social movement studies, feminist theory, affect 
theory and free spaces. With regard to social movement studies, I went through those concepts the 
research  is  imbued  with,  such  as  collective  behaviour, resources,  framing,  outcomes,  emotions, 
contention. By referring to new social movement theory, I argued about the need to go back to 
Melucci’s  reflection  rejecting  a  dichotomous  opposition  between  materialist  and  post-materialist 
values. Although new social movements, such as the women’s movement and the environmental 
movement, shed light on the role of culture in the call for social change, they did not dismiss the 
elements of class relations and capitalist system as fields of action. By building on materialist feminist 
literature, this research aims to give a comprehensive view on the way social movements produce 
free spaces, within the neoliberal setting and against it.  
In order to explore feminist movements and spaces, I build on the importance of a re-evaluation of 
emotions, through the concept of affects. Affect theory, grounded in Spinoza’s work, sheds light on 
the way bodies/minds perceive affects and are affected by them. Affects have the potential to increase 
or decrease the capacity for action and the bodily power to action. While this process is usually 
scouted at the individual level, I will also analyse the process at the collective level. My argument is 
that the conscious work on affects allows feminist spaces to increase their capacity for action, both at 
the individual and collective level.  
Finally, I went through the literature on free spaces, by showing similarities and differences with the 
literature on safe spaces. While this concept risks alluding to a defensive meaning, or to purely 
internal dynamics, I will set out safer spaces as relational site of work on affect, which not only allows 

67 
 
communities to keep organising, but also transforms the communities’ capacity to interact with other 
players and to cooperate in the movements’ diffusion.  
The research aims to develop our understanding of new social movement and the use of emotions by 
the means of affects and free spaces. It aims to integrate the literature on social movement studies by 
bringing in the significant contributions of feminist theory and affect theory, through the empirical 
case of feminist spaces.

3. Methodology, Methods and Ethics  
 
 
3.1 Introduction 
 
Feminists are presently exploring the far-reaching implications of a new epistemological viewpoint based on 
the idea of knowledge as embodied, engendered and embedded in the material context of place and space. 
This requires not amendments or additions to allegedly universal (but in actuality masculinist and often 
Eurocentric) discourse, nor a reversal, but a “strategic transformation”. 
(Duncan 1996: 1) 
 
Researching feminist spaces, their political communities and the way in which activists enact political 
and  emotional  processes  that  transform  the  space  as safer is  a  challenging  task,  both  for 
epistemological and methodological reasons (De Molina 2004, Prieur 2015). The thick and clear 
description of methodological inquiry sheds light on the research process and key issues that emerged 
during the empirical part, and the ethical commitment in every kind of social scientific product (della 
Porta and Keating 2008). In this section I will set out methodological choices and fieldwork insights. 
Firstly (3.2), I will frame the standpoint of this research and my specific location – as a researcher 
and  a  feminist  activist – with  regard  to  the  subject  of  this  study.  Only  a  constant  self-reflexive 
endeavour allowed me to understand the limits, biases and viewpoints through which my research 
has been shaped. Secondly (3.3), I will present the supporting pillars of this project: participatory 
action  research,  feminist  approach  and  constructivist  grounded  theory.  These  three  different 
approaches, rarely melted in a coherent methodological perspective, present significant consistencies 
(and  several  differences)  to  research  feminist  movements and  spaces,  allowing  a  deeper 
understanding  of  the  puzzle.  Countries  and  their  respective  cities  (Rome  and  Madrid)  will  be 
presented as relevant key setting for this study (3.4), according to a comparative aim that led the 
selection of cases and empirical subjects of my research. In order to answer my research questions, I 
selected three methods (3.5), which allowed me to disentangle the different aspects of the puzzle: 
participant observation, interviews and focus groups. Through my fieldnotes (3.6) I will then describe 
the  process  of  gaining  access  and  to  perform  a  situated  research.  Finally,  through  constructivist 
grounded theory (3.7), I will stress the elements of data analysis which significantly shaped the results 
of  this  research;  and  I  will  assess the  dissemination  of  results  (and  the  role  of  researcher 
accountability) as a key issue (3.8) while performing participatory action research.  
 
3.2 Feminism as a Method: Politics of Location and Self-Reflexivity  
 

69 
 
The idea of feminism as a method in social sciences arises parallel to the emergence of a second wave 
of  feminist  mobilisations,  during  the  1970s.  Sandra  Harding,  in  1987,  systematised  those 
contributions coming from different disciplines – psychology, history, sociology, political theory, 
economics – upon the question: “is there a feminist method?” (Harding 1987: 1). The answer concerns 
different  dimensions,  constitutive  of  a  feminist  way  to  approach  methods:  the  purpose,  that  is  a 
production of knowledge for women, focused on women’s experiences; methodology, or the theory 
that structures the way research is pursued; methods, or the different tools meant to empirically 
address the issues posed by the research questions (Harding 1987, Hammersley 1992, Reinharz 1992, 
Duncan  1996).  The  general  assumption  underlying  feminist  methods  is  a  challenge  to  the  male 
universal understanding of social sciences as a neutral, objective, and scientific way of conducting 
research  (Hanson  and  Monk  1982,  Duncan  1996,  Borghi  and  Rondinone  2009).  Research,  and 
researchers, are always situated: their experience as bodies, identities, and education defines the 
location from which they look at social reality.  
 
The academy today continues to be dominated by this conceptualization of knowledge and reason. 
Knowledge  requires  public  confirmation,  universality  and  a  demonstrable  transcendence  of 
emotion  and  commitment.  Knowledge  must  be  capable  of  being  expressed  as  an  immaterial 
abstraction, beyond the irreducible concreteness of the particular, and can only be achieved in the 
public domain, among men, primarily through the aggressive interplay of adversarial discourse. 
Knowledge does not occur in private, it does not occur within the context of loving relationships, 
and  it  cannot  occur where  research  is  guided  by  political  commitments.  By  the  early  1980s, 
feminist theorists thus began to recognize that they needed to develop a better account of the 
relationship  between  reason,  theory  and  bodily,  subjective  experience.  To  paraphrase  Rosi 
Braidotti, we need to elaborate a truth which is not removed from the body, reclaiming [our] body 
for [ourselves]... [We need] to develop and transmit a critique which respects and bears the trace 
of the intensive, libidinal force that sustains it. (Braidotti 1991:8). (Alcoff 1996: 17-18) 
 
One of the most well-known dissertations on the false neutrality of knowledge situated is Donna 
Haraway’s Situated Knowledge: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial 
Perspective (1988), in which the author explicitly calls for an embodied research. Reflecting on the 
production of knowledge and the role of the researcher, Haraway attacks the supposed “objectivity” 
of  science  and  knowledge,  claiming  for  a  situated  path  which  always  depends  on  the  gaze, 
background, and choices of the researcher. It means challenging the male discourse on science, which 
is certain about the possibility to know reality “as it is,” in its truth, failing the contextual and personal 
perspective that affect the whole discipline.  
 
All  knowledge  is  a  condensed  node  in  an  agonistic  power  field.  The  strong  program  in  the 
sociology of knowledge joins with semiology and deconstruction to insist on the rhetorical nature 
of truth, including scientific truth. History is a story Western culture buffs tell each other; science 
is a contestable text and a power field. (Haraway 1988: 577)

Well before the conceptualisation of Sandra Harding on the feminist standpoint theory and the fallacy 
of strong objectivity (1992), Adrienne Rich pointed out the puzzle in her Notes Toward a Politics of 
Location. In this paper, the author argues in favour of the materiality of the body both in politics and 
epistemology, also due to the contention launched by Black feminist in those years. Being female, 
white, and well-educated is quite different from other starting conditions and has to be spelt out by 
authors. 
 
To locate myself in my body means more than understanding what it has meant to me to have a 
vulva and clitoris and uterus and breasts. It means recognizing this white skin, the place it has 
taken me, the place it has not let me go. [...] Recognizing our location, having to name the ground 
we’re coming from, the condition we’ve taken for granted. (Rich 1984: 215-219) 
 
Acknowledging our position as researchers in the field of the discipline, but also in the fieldwork, is 
a way to ethically carry out the research (Milan 2014). The way in which knowledge is produced – 
the selection of research questions and methods, the researcher’s positionality – has an impact on 
results and findings, because “all research findings have political implication” (Denzin and Lincoln 
2005 in Milan 2014: 446). As Milan stresses (2014), this is particularly true with regard to social 
movement studies and grassroot political participation, for different reasons: firstly, because of the 
production of knowledge that the movement pursues in itself, which the researcher always needs to 
address, through a respectful and self-reflexive stance; secondly, because of the risk the researcher 
exposes activists to, since “involving activists in a research project has consequences which cannot 
be ignored” (Milan 2014: 446); moreover, because activists tend to expect from the researcher a sort 
of political alignment (since they are political actors) and “an ethically informed positioning of the 
researcher in relation to the values and practices of the movement then becomes crucial” (Milan 2014: 
447); finally, because research is a labour for the researcher, and for activists too, since being involved 
in  a  research  is  time- and  energy-consuming,  both  resources  that  activists  could  have  used  in  a 
different way. Last, but not least, researching social movements – and, above all, feminisms – “is a 
matter of relationship building as much as it is an epistemological and ontological question” (Milan 
2014: 446).  
The  major  contribution  to  feminist  methods  draws  on  the  issue  of  relationship.  The  relational 
dimension is the key element of feminist reflections on doing research, since the procedure of data 
gathering is a proper relational process between the researcher and the participants (Reinharz 1992). 
My research has been deeply built on a relational endeavour. My effort has been, on one hand, to 
explicitly claim my location in the field, as well as my previous networks linked to the singular cases. 
On the other hand, to take care of each encounter, discussion and relationship from the beginning to 
the very end. I have been transparent and ethically committed in exposing the design and goals of the 

71 
 
research, and in describing the risks involved in taking part in an academic research for activists, 
which  are  often  balanced  on  a  blurred  line  between  legality  and  illegality.  I  negotiated  ways  to 
guarantee anonymity, but also to decide together what would have been part of the research and what 
would not. I always introduced myself through a hard-copy ethical declaration, where I explained my 
research, my purpose and the way the data would have been treated.  
I entered the field with the aim to immediately position myself. Some elements were, of course, 
visible when I introduced myself in person: my gender, as female; my age, as young, and my ethnicity, 
as an Italian (even though during Lucha Y Siesta’s first period of fieldwork it often occurred that 
women hosted at the house misinterpreted my origin, thinking I was a woman of colour, and getting 
even more friendly with me). Other elements were not so easily perceivable, such as my level of 
education, my class background, and the reasons of my presence there.  
During the phase of access, when I virtually contacted participants or groups, I described my research 
and my position in academia, but also my involvement in feminist movements in several Italian cities 
(Padova, Florence and Rome) through some networks, such as local and national Non Una di Meno 
assemblies.  This  element  crucially  changed  the  participants’  stance  toward  me,  rapidly  opening 
spaces of trust and intimacy otherwise difficult to achieve.  
All these personal dimensions have been part of a constant self-reflexive part of my fieldnotes. There, 
I wrote down how my access in the field occurred, how the participants perceived me, and which 
relations we established. These notes are a constitutive part of data analysis, since the research process 
is built on such self-reflexive stance.  
 
3.3 Participatory Action Research, Feminist Methods and Constructivist 
Grounded Theory as a Comprehensive Approach 
 
This research project is strongly shaped by three epistemological and methodological approaches: 
participatory action research (PAR), feminist methods, and constructivist grounded theory (CGT). 
Although so far sporadic attention has been paid to the intersections among these approaches, they 
present  challenging  consistencies in  order  to  disentangle  the  feminist  movements’  production  of 
spaces. Greater efforts have been directed toward the analysis of the bridge between feminist methods 
and PAR (Gatenby and Humphries 2000, Chakma 2016, Tolhurst et al. 2012, Trimita 2016), or 
grounded theory and feminist methods (Allen 2011, Ford 2014, Hall and Callery 2001, Keddy, Sims 
and Noerager Stern 1996, Olesen 2007, Plummer and Young 2010, Wuest 1995), but rarely these 
three approaches have been kept together.  

72 
 
In this section, after an overview of the history and the applications of these methodologies, I will 
argue that all of them present several points of connection: the focus on research questions, research 
design,  and  data  analysis  as  a  shared  result  between  researcher  and  participants;  the  role  of  the 
researcher and their impact in the fieldwork; the researcher/participants relation; the purpose of the 
research as a driving force in social change.  
Action research has a longstanding tradition in social sciences, such as Alquati and workerists’ 1970s 
“conricerca,” focused on worker class conditions, or Freire’s approaches toward an adult education 
research, and Fals Borda’s efforts in researching Columbian communities and their social justice aim. 
All of these approaches are united by the challenge to the traditional way to produce knowledge, to 
change research questions and the whole research design as issues arising from social reality and 
direct actors, to produce results through an in-depth collaboration between the researcher and the 
participants.  Or,  as  Fuster  Morell  stresses  (2009),  by  five  tendencies:  “participative-collective 
method;  producing  alternative  content;  strategic  thinking  for  political  processes;  building 
relationships and networking connections; and opening knowledge” (2009: 21). PAR is a challenging 
option for everyone interested in studying marginal and non-hegemonic populations, in my case 
women, lesbian, non-binary and queer subjects, and feminist spaces. It is, as Coghlan and Brydon-
Miller  call  it,  “a  participatory  and  action-oriented  approach  to  research  that  centres  gender  and 
women’s experiences both theoretically and practically” (2014: 343). As an approach to the empirical 
inquiry,  it  allows  a  “democratic,  equitable,  liberating  and  life-enhancing  qualitative inquiry” 
(MacDonald  2012,  34)  that  produces  a  shared  knowledge  on  the  topic  between  researcher  and 
participants. PAR complies with “the need for researchers from across a number of disciplines to 
participate with people in improving and understanding the world by changing it” (McIntyre 2007: 
ix).  Involving  a  cyclic  process  of  research,  PAR  allows  an  extended  focus  on  every  part  of  the 
research,  from  the  research  questions  to  the  dissemination  of  results,  always  shared  and  co-
constructed with the participants. This approach stimulates a strong self-reflexivity in the researcher, 
confronting herself with views, meanings and actions expresses by participants, but also being aware 
about her position in the field. PAR is a valuable option facing social and feminist movements, as 
Milan singles out:  
The field of social movement studies demands a special engagement with the ethical dimensions 
of research for a number of reasons. First, as social movements are bearers of “new ways of seeing 
the world” (Cox and Flesher Forminaya 2009, 1), social movement research cannot ignore the 
knowledge and the political imaginaries movements themselves have produced: not only should 
research operate within the boundaries of said political imaginaries, it should also be respectful 
of the processes and reflexive practices (often participatory, horizontal, “from below”) that led to 
the creation of said knowledge. By way of example, researchers investigating participatory social 
movements should ideally try to embed some of those very same participatory mechanisms in 
their research design. (Milan 2014, 446) 
 

73 
 
The choice of PAR in this research project immediately emerged as a key factor, because of several 
elements. My position (as an academic and activist), the subjects (women, lesbian, non-binary and 
queer  people,  feminist  and  transfeminist  activists);  the  cases  (feminist  spaces  and  their  active 
resistance in the urban context; the common situation of crisis and threat of eviction); data collection 
and data analysis (grounded in data and in the relationship with participants); the aim of the research 
(understanding if and how these spaces are safer, and how to make the research worthwhile for 
participants and feminist spaces). Moreover, I am specifically interested in understanding meanings 
and values produced by a given community which enacts a given collective action. To confront 
ourselves as researchers with marginal populations means questioning our role, our views, and our 
initial assumption by trying to get in touch with perspectives that can, potentially, be completely 
different from our beliefs. For these reasons, PAR enables the free expression of all participants, 
taking into account the specific purpose of social justice. PAR emerged as the most valuable option 
in order to investigate spaces as safer, that is to understand political and emotional views implied in 
producing a feminist space in a male-based social reality. I soon recognised that I needed to perceive 
what the participants perceive, to see what they see and to acknowledge how my inner self and body 
were  feeling  unsafe/safe  in  different  spaces  (public  transports,  urban  spaces,  protests,  marches, 
political spaces, feminist communities, feminist meetings and so on). The way to understand safer 
spaces is to experience them, and to share this experience with the participants.  
At the same time, I engage with the constructivist grounded theory approach (Charmaz 2008), as a 
general stance in the steps of literature review, gathering of data, and analysis: all the knowledge and 
theories produced during the research are grounded in data. The purpose of generating theory is 
grounded in the data, through a circular process where the researcher goes back and forth from data 
to the concept’s development (Mattoni 2014). Since the method is strongly embedded in data, the 
research questions and literature review are not precisely defined from the beginning, but the research 
starts with a group of general questions that will be, from time to time, re-addressed and specified 
(Glauser and Strauss, 1967). The aim is to avoid initial convictions and bias as much as possible. The 
researcher follows the process of empirical research, led by participants and their views, words, and 
ideas.  As  an  ontological,  epistemological,  and  methodological  choice,  constructivism  foresees  a 
production of knowledge attached to social reality and produced by the people involved in it, which 
is not as a universal, absolute, and true reality that has to be discovered. Contesting Glauser and 
Strauss’s  (1967)  “systematic,  inductive,  and  comparative  approach,”  often  addressed  as  post-
positivist (Wuest, 1995, Bryant and Charmaz 2007), Charmaz claims that:  
 

74 
 
The  constructivist  approach  perspective  shreds  notions  of  a  neutral  observer  and  value-free 
expert.  Not  only  does that  mean  that  researchers  must  examine  rather  than  erase  how  their 
privileges and preconceptions may shape the analysis, but it also means that their values shape 
the  very  fact  that  they  can  identify.  [...]  I  chose  the  term  “constructivist”  to  acknowledge 
subjectivity and the researcher’s involvement in the construction and interpretation of data and to 
signal the differences between my approach [...] (Charmaz 2006: 13-14) 
 
The constructivist turn means a shift both in epistemology and methodology, since it changes the way 
in  which  the  researcher  approaches  social  reality,  but  also  the  tools  that  they  use.  Even  though 
Charmaz (2006) follows the process of gathering, organising and analysing data proposed by Glaser 
and Strauss’s (1967), she – and others (Bryant 2007, Charmaz and Bryant 2007) – argues for a 
theoretical rendering that gives “an interpretative portrayal of the studied world, not an exact picture 
of it” (Charmaz 2006: 17). 
During my fieldwork, I soon realised how these three approaches to social inquiry (PAR, feminist 
methods, and CGT) were deeply interconnected, posing some key questions: the focus on research 
questions,  research  design,  and  data  analysis  as  a  shared  result  between  the  researcher  and  the 
participants; the role of the researcher and their impact in the fieldwork; the researcher/participants 
relation; the purpose of the research as a driving force in social change.  
When I first introduced myself to the participants, I gave them an overview of my research project, 
explaining the participatory attempt, in order to involve them in the process from the very beginning. 
When I spoke with some of the activists for the first time, or in the case of Cagne Sciolte during the 
first meeting I attended, they deeply questioned all the aspects of the project, contesting or re-shaping 
some parts. All of them agreed on the relevance of researching feminist spaces, but they often deeply 
challenged the notion of “safety,” especially because the term carries a dangerous ambiguity in its 
Italian translation. LYS’s activists proposed some issues that were relevant for them, for instance 
what was present or lacking (services, public transports, spaces of liveability) for women in their 
neighbourhood; whereas CID’s activists were affected by generational issues (like the scarcity of 
young participants), the political purpose of the space, and their role as meaningful actors in the 
political arena and feminist movements. During CS’s meeting, they directly asked me if it would have 
been possible to deeply share and negotiate all passages of the research. It was the first time they 
accepted to be part of an academic research: before that, they had always rejected. They deeply care 
about anonymity, and they are inspired by libertarian values. That is why they wanted to be involved 
in all the processes – by deciding what would have been part of the research and what not, how to 
address some issues, and so on. They also asked for a clear explanation of data analysis and they 
wanted to be involved in the process. Finally, they wanted to produce some valuable material out of 
the research for themselves, such as narratives and imaginaries which tell the history of the space, 

75 
 
and a video explaining their experiences as a radical queer transfeminist squat. During the fieldwork, 
I often shared some pages of my fieldnotes regarding their space, and we discussed it together. I also 
shared, from time to time, papers and articles that I wrote down during these years, explaining part 
of the research process, in order to make them aware about the steps I took and my findings. This has 
been  part  of  a  continuous  self-reflexive  process  in  which  I  discussed  and  re-positioned  myself 
depending on the participants’ feedback.  
I soon realised that PAR was not always suitable in its whole prescription. I also understood that 
PAR, more than a model, is a perspective and a ladder of intensity. In the first case, at the CID, I was 
struggling to become active part of the community – both for the physical limits of the space, which 
is  a  huge  and dispersive  building,  and  for  relational  issues,  since,  as  old  feminists,  they  were 
suspicious of me (as a young and unknown researcher), which changed a bit only when they realised 
that I came from a prestigious university. There, I applied only part of the PAR provisions, like the 
stress on the relationship with participants and the trust-building process, my disposition in taking 
part and helping in practical activities, the willingness to share the results with them in order to 
produce something worthwhile for the space itself. Thus, I realised that PAR is a flexible and modular 
approach, from a lesser intensity to a stronger intensity, depending on the singular cases’ dispositions. 
With regard to the Spanish case, instead, the pandemic outbreak significantly affected the fieldwork. 
PAR was not fully viable because during the months of the fieldwork (January-May 2021), these 
spaces were partially closed to the public, and activists were overwhelmed by the consequences of 
the health crisis. As a perspective, there are aspects that can be used in a systematic way, and others 
that only apply to some cases, according to the participants’ availability.  
My presence was perceived as more or less intense depending on the spaces’ characteristics. At the 
CID, which is a very large building, I was just one of the women spending their time there. In some 
cases, I turned out to be useful only because I was a young girl, as when the German ambassador 
went to visit the CID and they asked me to spend the whole afternoon with them in order to show 
how heterogeneous the composition of the CID was. Instead, at LYS, which is a smaller space, my 
presence was more visible. Every time I was there, there were women hosted at the house that came 
offering a coffee, some food, a chat or asking for help with their children. I tried to reduce the impact 
of my presence there by offering my help or skills for whatever was needed. For instance, I helped a 
Lebanese  woman  with  her  documents  for  university  registration,  or  other  women  with  English 
reading and comprehension, or a woman with health issues to schedule some medical visits. Since 
the beginning, LYS’s activists told me that the only way to research LYS was to become a part of 
LYS, by giving help also in practical activities. That is why I started inserting my name in shift tables, 
helping during public initiatives, washing dishes and so on. Those times were precious moments in 

76 
 
order to transform my presence there, to gain trust and intimacy, to become part of the daily life of 
the house, and to become progressively accountable for activists, participants and their children. Even 
to face some troublesome moment, as when a little girl spilled a jar full of glitter on the keyboard of 
my laptop, just to get my attention.  
The relational part of the research has been the most challenging and the richest. I passed through 
moments of frustration, loneliness, inadequacy, uncertainty, and bewilderment, but I also managed 
to establish durable relationships of trust and mutual understanding. I often became an accountable 
part of these spaces and a point of reference in case of troubles or needs. The research has been 
profoundly shaped by these relationships, which were the ground of empirical results.  
On the contrary, due to previous networks, I was closer to CS’s activists, since we already knew each 
other and I was, in some cases, close friends with some of them. Hence, the task has been to clearly 
define boundaries: which were private chats and which were part of the research, which moments I 
was attending as a friend and a comrade and which one as a researcher. The previous trust they felt 
toward me has been the reason of their acceptance to be part of the research (since they generally 
mistrust academic environment and research), but it was also a challenging factor defining our mutual 
positions in a changing relationship. We found an agreement in order to preserve the balance of our 
proximity: with them, I almost entirely avoided the ethnographic part. In that regard, it would have 
been too hard to select information and to define spaces of intimacy or research. Instead, we held 
long in-depth interviews and created a focus group, which was missing in the other cases.  
With the Spanish feminist spaces, I was able to attend only a few moments in presence, because of 
the pandemic. I followed online activities, radio broadcasts and live-streaming events. However, the 
relationships we could establish were, for evident reasons, different than the Italian spaces, and the 
trust-building process was affected by the constraints of the pandemic. Nonetheless, with some of 
them we managed to share moments of conversation, reflection, and drinks, which developed into 
networks well beyond the fieldwork.  
The common phase of crisis, due to the threat of eviction, made the research more appealing, since it 
came to be a sort of institutional acknowledgement from a prestigious university (such as Scuola 
Normale Superiore, one of the most historically respected and admired universities in Italy). The 
phase of crisis also made it important for these spaces to make whoever was attending the space 
useful, trying to turn people’s skills, networks, and resources toward the defence and enhancement 
of these spaces. For instance, I was immediately involved in a cycle of meetings intended to re-define 
the role and aims at the CID, and several times during these meetings someone asked me to express 
my view, since I was “probably the most informed person in the CID, because I spent so much time 
there and because of my deep formation in gender studies and sociology” (Fieldnotes, CID, 16-10-

77 
 
18). Or when LYS’s activists decided to launch a popular purchase of the space, trying to avoid the 
auction,  opening  the  “Comitato  Lucha  alla  città,”  a  committee  composed  of  groups  working  on 
different issues, and they asked me to take part in the one on study since “we need people like you to 
study the situation and find some exit strategies” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 10-10-19). I always balanced my 
position in these situations, trying to give something back – since I was taking so much – but also 
preserving an ethical stance. I was not always able to manage it, for the emotional charge in situations 
of eviction is pervasive and I was not immune, because of my involvement in the fieldwork.  
A lot of questions remain open for future research. For instance, the way in which to perform a 
systematic  involvement  of  participants  in  all  the  research  phases,  sharing  notions,  emotions  and 
findings. But also: how to remain open to participants’ views and suggestions, keeping in mind the 
general framework of the research. And then, despite the inevitable phases of saturation, keeping an 
accountable and trustful relation with participants, re-modeling the level of intensity of relationships 
depending on different phases. And finally, how to be faithful to the initial purpose and to deeply 
engage with the dissemination of results, according to the aim of social research as a lead to social 
change.  
 
3.4 Selection of Cases and Comparative Dimension 
 
This is a case-oriented research (George and Bennett 2005, Gerring 2007, Blatter and Haverland 
2012, Rohlfing 2012), based on cross-national comparative analysis. A small-N comparative research 
is  here  preferred  in  order  “to  go  beyond  descriptive  statistical  measures,  towards  an  in-depth 
understanding of historical processes and individual motivations.” (della Porta and Keating 2008: 
202). Analysing feminist spaces as safe spaces requires an in-depth understanding of the context, of 
political engagement and collective dynamics, “grasping the relations among its constituent parts” 
(della  Porta  and  Keating  2008:  205)  toward  a  nuanced  and  complex  knowledge  about  specific 
processes. The purpose is not oriented towards generalisations, but towards space and a temporarily 
limited  comprehension  of  the  cases  taken  into  study:  the  results  are  not  universally  valid,  but 
contextual to a specific time frame and social process. Findings are “dense knowledge,” disentangling 
a  complex  unit  of  analysis.  Cases  are  addressed  as  complex units,  and  concepts  of  them  are 
constructed during the research and grounded in data. The number of cases is low in order to allow a 
systematic analysis and to get as many elements as possible. Cases – within the framework of a clear 
definition of feminist spaces – differ from each other, leading to a deep exploration of differences. I 
observed  cases  throughout  their  historical  perspective,  both  in  the  national  landscape  and  in  the 
contextual political developments.  

78 
 
I inductively selected cases throughout the research process, following a “systematic dialogue of ideas 
and evidence” (Ragin 2004 in della Porta and Keating 2008: 209). I firstly defined the framework of 
my research and my research questions, based on the understanding of feminist spaces as safe spaces. 
Feminist  spaces  are  those  spaces  which  are  explicitly  addressed  by  their  activists  as  political 
(feminist), as collective (managed by a community of activists) and meaningfully located (because 
of a certain political explanation of their position in that part of the city). Even though limited to these 
characteristics, feminist spaces include a wide range of political and social cases. In order to keep a 
complex understanding on a complex unit, I progressively identified three movement cultures and 
politics (among many): a house of women, coming from the legacy of the 1970s and inspired by a 
hybrid identity between institutionalisation and movement; a feminist space oriented toward direct 
social action and knowledge production, where women take care of other women, through a grassroot 
and self-managed re-configuration of services; a queer and transfeminist space, coming from different 
legacies  (feminist,  trans,  LGBT  and  queer  movements).  Once  these  three  types  of  spaces  were 
identified, I then selected countries (Italy and Spain), cities (Rome and Madrid), cases – three for 
each city (the International House of Women, the House of Women Lucha Y Siesta, the space of 
Cagne Sciolte, the Espacios de Igualdad, the Eskalera Karakola, the Plataforma Encuentros Bolleros). 
I started forming a hypothesis: that all of these cases were producing a type of safe space. I maintained 
the assumption in order to contest it throughout the research process, challenging the definition (and 
reconsidering safe spaces not as stable dimension but as a political and emotional process), and the 
way in which it was detectable (or not) within different cases.  
Italy immediately emerged as a meaningful country for different reasons. First, for the feasibility of 
the project, since I am Italian and I know the language; because I have a feminist activist background, 
and I already know the context, groups and spaces, as well as having previously established networks 
that have been crucial for the research. Then, because of the historical legacies of feminist movements 
in the Italian context and contemporary resurgence (Non Una di Meno movement), and the well-
rooted  experience  of  feminist  spaces,  especially  in  cities  such  as  Rome,  Milan,  Bologna,  Turin, 
Napoli and beyond. Finally, because of the contemporary economic, social and political setting: 
whether neoliberal policies are progressively linked to a growing consensus around populist and 
extreme right-wing parties, few grassroot movements are challenging this status quo, driving protests 
and a harsh attack to institutional agenda. Among these few, feminist movements have been one of 
the most vibrant, through major protest events (such as the feminist strike on 8 March or marches 
against gender violence and structural violence) and local political participation.  
Rome, the Italian capital, represents one of the most interesting cases. The size of the city (a huge 
metropolis with around 3 million inhabitants) (Lelo, Monni and Tomassi 2019); the great vitality of 

79 
 
its social movements (engaged in environmental issues, precariat, social inequalities, migration and 
so on) (Mudu 2014); the historical embeddedness of feminist movements in the social and political 
ground of the city (Stelliferi 2015); the variety of feminist spaces: all of these elements contributed 
to make the city a challenging case. The increasing level of social inequalities and poverty affected 
the Roman population, and growing attention has been drawn to the phenomenon of gender-based 
violence, due to numerous cases of feminicide and the structural lack of helping services. Feminist 
spaces are often replacing institutional gaps, with regard to social inequalities and, more specifically, 
women’s needs.  
The  cross-national  comparative  dimension  was  immediately  required  in  order  to  gain  a  deeper 
understanding on the topic, by analysing different countries and political trajectories. The choice of 
two countries has been made in order to avoid the problem of concept-stretching (Munck 2004), “as 
well  as  the  reliability  and  comparability  of  measures  and  indicators  used  to  translate  national 
experiences into comparable operational categories” (della Porta and Keating 2008: 210). Adopting 
the most-similar system approach (della Porta and Keating 2008), and so reducing the number of 
“disturbing” variables, Spain emerged as a second feasible case, due to several reasons. The two 
countries belong to the common geographical area (Southern Europe) and share some degrees of 
historical tradition, cultural traits and economic crisis impact. Since the end of Franco’s dictatorship, 
Spain quickly developed as a democratic country, by achieving a progressive parliamentary setting 
and  several  policies  improvements.  Differently  than  Italy,  from  2004  the  Spanish  parliament 
approved  a  specific  law  fully  protecting  women  against  gender  violence,  also  called machista 
violence. From then on, the number of feminicide slowly decreased, even though the structural issue 
of gender violence remains unchanged, and is still expressed through inequalities in workplaces and 
salaries, unpaid reproductive work, constant attacks on abortion rights, daily harassment, catcalling, 
threats, and so on.  In the last few years, a renewed feminist movement emerged, strongly influenced 
by women’s participation in the 15-M 2011, through the creation of the Marea Violeta (Violet Tide) 
(Portos 2019). Collectives and feminist groups flourished across Spain, more autonomously than 
other social movements. In 2014, the movement “Yo Decido” strongly contested a restrictive change 
of abortion law, finally winning. 8 March 2019 saw a high level of participation, and  the adherence 
to the feminist strike reached a 70% rate in public schools, and a participation of over 6 million people 
overall.  
Madrid  was  the  core  of  these  processes:  the  dismantling  of  the  Francoist  regime  and  the  partly 
unchanged  presence  of  Francoist  people  in  the  institutional  apparatus;  the  democratic  building 
process (Threlfall, Cousins and Valiente 2005); the outbreak of the 15-M (Portos 2019); the diffusion 
of municipalism (Rubio-Pueyo 2017, Janoschka and Mota 2020); the widespread presence of the 

80 
 
feminist movements and the relevance of the city on the organisation of the feminist general strike 
on 8 March (Campillo 2019).  
To me, the choice of the Spanish case also means challenging a sort of “comfort zone,” and a deep 
knowledge of the Italian case. It opened up the possibility for new viewpoints of understanding 
through a different country, different language, different political background.  
Even though it might be arguable that comparing similar countries does not allow one to go beyond 
middle-range theories, the choice is consistent with the pursuit of an in-depth understanding of a 
specific process. The comparison will not be 50-50, due to the longer period of fieldwork in Rome, 
the amount of data I collected there and the spread of the pandemic of Coronavirus. Nonetheless, the 
comparative stance will be a crucial framework of data analysis.  
As a time-frame, I adopted the contextual time-scan of my research project (from 2017 to 2021), a 
period in which I conducted the fieldwork (in a circular movement between fieldwork and data-
analysis). The historical perspective was not avoided, rather emerging through the participants’ words 
and stories.  
 
3.5 Triangulation of Methods: Participant Observation, Interviews and Focus 
Groups  
 
The empirical part of the research was carried out through three techniques: participant observation, 
interviews, and focus groups. All these methods present limits and strengths. The triangulation of 
methods allows a complex collection of data, to uphold the fieldwork throughout different angles and 
to fill the reciprocal lacks of each method (Ayoub, Wallace and Zapeda-Milliàn 2014). The choice 
complies with the need of the PAR approach, based on a relational research process between the 
researcher and the participants. Thus, I managed to share most of the research phases with them, 
discussing time, space, information, and negotiating the collection of data. Participant observation 
was the channel of access in each space. Then, I collected the same number of interviews in each 
space, and I performed a focus group with CS.  
 
Participant Observation 
Participant observation was the first way to get in touch with these spaces and communities. Even 
though is not the most common method in social movement studies (Balsiger and Lambelet 2014), 
in my case it was a crucial way to understand why women spend time and effort in producing feminist 
spaces, and how these spaces are (or are not) safe for women. 
Indeed, the purpose (or essence) of participant observation, from Malinowski (1922) to today, is 
to view and to understand events through the perspective of the people one studies. Participant 

81 
 
observation is thus a technique of research where the incorporation of the researcher into the 
group  he  or  she  wants  to  study  is a  fundamental  element.  Researchers  take  part  in  the  same 
situation in order to understand the contradictions, the stakes, and the social expectations that 
people being studied experience. (...) Participation and observation conducted with reflexivity, 
combined  with  other  methods  for  triangulation,  produce  data  that  are  confident  enough  for 
extrapolation. (Balsinger and Lambelet 2014: 146) 
 
Driving  participant  observation  has  been  a  way  to  observe  forms  of  collective  behaviour;  to 
understand the heterogeneity of such groups; to shed light on the non-public sides of feminist spaces 
and the implicit meanings that enable activists to act together; to see the nuances or discrepancies 
between public stance, ideology, and daily practices of the group; to understand roles and political 
socialisation; and to learn through an embodied research. “For some authors, like Melucci (1996), it 
is impossible to really understand a social situation if you only observe it: you have to act and be part 
of it” (Balsinger and Lambelet 2014: 151). To me, the periods of time I spent in these spaces were an 
enlightening phase that allowed me to grasp collective identities, strategies, internal dynamics, and 
processes,  and  to  get  a  general  overview  of  each  space.  Only  through  participant observation  I 
understood names, roles, relationships, frictions, and the political but especially emotional shape of 
each space. These experiences served as a necessary background in order to prepare well-focused 
interviews, to choose the interviewees, and to plan effective focus groups. The whole process has 
been abductive and field-driven, since I followed step by step the insights and needs emerging from 
the fieldwork.  
I usually introduced myself through an e-mail, and then met one or more activists of the space in 
order to better define my presence and participation. Sometimes, we also discussed the possibility to 
conduct the research in itself (as in the case of CS). In Rome, I spent one year and a half (non-
consecutive) doing fieldwork. I approximately dedicated around three months of in-depth participant 
observation in each space, but I kept participating in events, public protests and open meetings of 
those spaces for the whole period of the fieldwork. I spent five months in Madrid, and due to time-
constraints  and  the  pandemic  outbreak,  I  continued  to  follow  the  activities  of  the  three  spaces 
researched mostly on online platforms.  
I clearly remembered the first time I entered each space. Those moments were exciting, but also 
awkward, and disorienting. Being a woman was an advantage, but, as a newcomer, it took a long time 
to pass from being seen as an “outsider” to being part of the space.  
For the whole duration of the fieldwork, I wrote down fieldnotes. I used the laptop, the note or vocal 
records, depending on the different situations and opportunities, but I did it on a daily basis. Initially, 
I divided my notes into descriptive notes, methodological notes, theoretical notes and self-reflexive 
notes. As time passed, I ended up writing a stream of consciousness based on the information I 

82 
 
considered progressively more important for my work. The first time I opened my notes, I felt lost 
and started writing about the rain, colours, people, and smells. Taking notes has been a learning 
process that followed the inner shape of the research. 
I slowly understood how to inhabit such spaces depending on their physical setting, their activities 
and the characteristics of the activists’ groups. For instance, I spent the first two weeks at the CID 
trying to figure out where to stay: since it is a very large building, I tried to spend some time in the 
garden, then in different part of the corridors, then in different rooms, in order to find the right angle 
to observe and to participate in the CID’s daily life. I ended up spending most of my time at the 
reception, a room with two secretaries in charge of managing the phone and all the practicalities of 
the House’s management: I chose it because all of the women entering had to pass through that room, 
and stopped to talk with the secretaries, either to have a chat with them or to give them updates (both 
the women living daily in the House and the women looking for information). Differently, at LYS’s, 
since it is also a proper house where women live, it was much more sensitive to organise my presence. 
I started attending all the events, and then slowly I went there to work at the library. Once there, 
though, I rarely managed to work, because there were always women asking for help, or offering food 
and coffee, or children taking my hand and inviting me to play together. Those were really rich and 
precious moments, where I slowly built trust and intimacy with the women, and I let them guide me 
in discovering the house, the rooms, the garden, the kitchen. The communal kitchen was a key site. 
It is an intimate, cosy and warm space, where women share intimate thoughts or needs, take care of 
each  other,  tell  stories,  tragedies,  and  fun  facts.  Indeed,  that  space  has  been  crucial  for  my 
relationships with the women hosted at the house. Whereas at the CID women were quite suspicious 
for a long time, paradoxically at LYS women hosted in the house (women escaping male violence or 
serious social marginality) were welcoming and warm from the start. They were the main link to the 
group of activists, who, instead, tended to be a little less immediately friendly. CS’s space, on the 
other hand, required a different process, since I already knew the space and the activists. Moreover, 
the space is not open on a daily basis but only for specific occasions, such as meetings, events, 
festivals, and so on. I attended those moments, and the main issue there was managing our proximity, 
due to my previous link and actual friendship with most of them. Nevertheless, it was a challenging 
way  to  shape  the research,  through  the  negotiation  of  our  changing  roles  and  our  constant  re-
positioning among each other.  
As already mentioned with regard to the Spanish case, the period of participant observation was 
highly constrained by the pandemic. During the fieldwork, I followed most of the activities on online 
platforms. Only near the end of the fieldwork, when spring approached, the spaces were gradually 

83 
 
opening and I was able to visit them, to attend some assemblies and initiatives. Alternative platforms, 
such as Telegram, proved useful in order to witness and take part in the daily work of groups.  
The period of participant observation was highly demanding in time, from a practical and emotional 
point of view. During the fieldwork, I learned to be flexible and adaptive. Several situations arose in 
which I had to make a decision on the spot, and no methodological manual could have proved enough. 
Often, I felt alone in front of a crucial decision for the fieldwork: for instance, how to face provoking 
questions on my presence, how to take part in a meeting when I have been explicitly required to do 
it, how to deal with critical situations such as very intimate fighting during meetings, how to manage 
the women’s intimate request (in sensitive cases, such as with women escaping male violence). In 
order to remain clearheaded and receptive I often went back and forth from fieldwork to theorisation 
and data analysis, according to CGT. I sometimes needed to unwind to not feel too overwhelmed.  
Leaving the field, eventually, is a key part of participant observation. Unless I had time-constraints, 
I ended each period with a feeling of clear saturation. I felt that nothing more was emerging, and that 
I had my laptop and mind (too) full of information, feelings, and emotions. As PAR requires, it is 
strongly  recommended  to  take  care  of  all  the  research  passages,  and  thus  also  of  leaving.  The 
difficulty lies in the relationship with the participants and in the inner stance of the researcher. I 
clearly explained to the participants when I was interrupting the fieldwork, even though we never 
closed our contacts, since they keep taking part in data analysis and the dissemination of results. 
Being  clear  was  also  necessary  for  myself.  Especially  at  the  end  of  LYS’s  fieldwork,  I  felt 
overwhelmed and deeply attached to the women hosted at the House and to the activists (who were 
dealing with a dramatic moment under the threat of eviction and were constantly overstressed and 
exhausted). Getting to know situations of deep personal suffering, experiences of male violence, and 
vulnerabilities is a hard task, and it is not always easy to draw a boundary between the researcher 
identity and that of a sympathetic woman and activist. I left the field with plenty of data and emotions, 
and it took time to smooth things over. It required a strong self-reflexivity, a clear positioning with 
myself and with them, and an ordered research plan.  
 
Interviews 
Interviews have had a crucial role in data collection. I prepared the interview track only after the first 
period of participant observation. Indeed, I started participating and observing the spaces, collecting 
information, insights, ideas, and only after I pursued interviews as “a fundamental tool for generating 
empirical knowledge through asking people to talk about certain themes” (della Porta 2014: 228). 
Starting  with  the  interview  phase  has meant  passing  from  my  perception  of  spaces,  dynamics, 
emotions to directly asking activists their personal opinions and beliefs (Blee 2013). Understanding 

84 
 
the dimension of safety, a specific aspect of the complexity belonging to feminist spaces, is inevitably 
linked to the activists’ emotions and stories about their own efforts and perceptions. The interview 
guide, which was supposed to lead semi-structured and in-depth interviews, was based on three main 
trajectories: the individual process of involvement in feminist spaces (political socialisation, roles, 
motivations, beliefs); the (un)relevant dimensions needed to make a feminist space safe; the relation 
between  the  space  and  the  neighbourhood  and,  more  generally,  the  city.  Bearing  in  mind  these 
trajectories (then grouped in several questions), I followed the interviewee’s stories and narratives, 
re-orienting the interview when it strayed too far from the topics, but leaving the interviewee free to 
express herself, take her time, jump from one thought to another. These interviews were a tool for 
addressing the core of my research topic with the participants, discussing more or less openly the 
dimension of safety. Flexibility was required in this case, too, since I was interviewing very different 
political generations, and activists coming from different movement cultures. Words, concepts, and 
understanding completely changed from one space to the other, that is why I had to be adaptable and 
ready to re-shape my research toolkit. The notion of safety, as such, would have been impossible to 
address, for instance, at the CID. But what I was interested in was the reason why women inhabit and 
spend an often very consistent part of their time and energies in a political space which arises in order 
to fight male violence and women’s experiences of dispossession and mistreatments. Also, I was 
drawn to find out if and why these spaces are perceived as comfortable, cosy, and friendly, what 
triggers these emotions, and why they matter politically. Oriented toward these questions, I then 
changed words and frameworks in order for my aim to be understandable.  
As Blee explains (2012), observation is not enough, because people tend to avoid talking about what 
is taken for granted. Interviews are a flexible tool for generating new hypotheses and clarifying some 
others (della Porta 2014, Mattoni 2014).  
I collected about ten interviews for each Italian case, and about five interviews for each Spanish case. 
I selected the interviewees after a first period of observation, picking different roles, ages, levels of 
involvement, and duration of their political participation. All of the interviewees are activists (even 
the workers of the EDIs, who also consider themselves feminist activists), apart from a woman who 
was hosted at LYS: I include her here as a key informant, since in the course of eleven years she has 
been hosted five times at LYS. One of the interviewees involved in the Spanish case was also a key 
informant, since she was part of the clandestine armed groups that resisted Francisco Franco’s regime, 
and she had an historical perspective on the emergence of women’s movements and spaces in Spain. 
All of them are cis women, genderfluid or non-binary people, apart for a cis man, aged between 25 
and 75 years old. I contacted them through face-to-face conversations, e-mails or messages on their 
private  phone.  All  the  people  I  interviewed  already  knew  me  because  of  the  previous  period  of 

85 
 
observation. Nonetheless, I always introduced myself with a document explaining my project, my 
formation, and how the data I collected would have been treated. I always asked the interviewee 
where they preferred to be interviewed. Most of them decided to hold the interview in their respective 
spaces, some of them in their proper flat, and others at a bar or at the public gardens. It was interesting 
to notice which part of the space the interviewees would choose, because the choice complied with 
parts of their stories or experiences in that space. While in Italy I interviewed all of them in presence, 
most  of  the  interviews  carried  out  in  Spain  were  conducted  online,  because  of  the  Coronavirus 
pandemic.  
I conducted interviews with full attention and reception, trying to build a comfortably relational space 
together. It was sometimes hard to handle, since especially old activists happened to be provocative, 
demanding or challenging my position and myself. One time, when I was strategically “playing 
dumb,” an old activist reacted annoyed, saying that probably I would have needed to study a little bit 
more, and then suggesting me to read her books in order to fill some personal gaps. Using simple 
words and clear explanation was not always the best way, and I often had to be ready to discuss at 
the level that the interviewees were imposing during the conversation. It was also necessary to follow 
the interviewees’ needs and requirements: during the interview, the researcher asks a lot from the 
interviewee, and when the interviewee inquire about something in turn, it is worthwhile to prepare an 
adequate answer. One time, during a very long and intimate interview, an activist that already knew 
my story directly asked me: “how would you act in this situation? And how was it for you the 
disbandment of a feminist collective? How do you deal with these emotions doing this research?” 
(IIR4, LYS, 53). In that moment I could not find any easy answer, and I tried to balance an honest 
response, while avoiding a breach in our relation of trust, and without disclosing too much of my 
activist identity when I felt it could overlap too much with the researcher identity.  
Nonetheless, most of the interviewees were very glad to dedicate their time to the interview because, 
in the constant flux of activism, concerns and responsibilities, it represented a moment for themselves, 
in which to take time, talk about themselves and retrace their story and meanings even before their 
political engagement. The interviews, in a moment of crisis and threat of eviction, became a little 
oasis in which they had the possibility to focus on themselves and be at the centre of the discussion 
(a rare possibility in those moments). I took care of these feelings, trying to leave the interviewees all 
the time and space that was needed and without interfering with their stream of consciousness, tears 
or joyful memories.  
 
Focus Group  

86 
 
The participants of CS and I decided together to establish a focus group in order to balance the 
collection of data of the other cases. As mentioned above, at CS we avoided the time allotted to 
participant observation because of the difficulty to manage the proximity among each other. Methods 
such as in-depth interviews and a focus group were preferred because they were controlled moments 
where the research relationship was mediated by an agreed setting, a certain time, certain tools, and 
an awareness on both sides of the moment dedicated to the research. Focus groups are valuable 
methods in order to grasp group dynamics, to observe conversations and chats among participants, to 
stimulate  participants’  reflections  on  some  topics,  and  to  engage  them  with  the  production  of 
knowledge in the framework of the research project (Hennink 2013). In my case, it was also the 
occasion to engage with visual materials which favoured channels of communication other than the 
spoken word: often, people have different types of capacities and skills, which range from speech to 
practical activities, to song, to dance. Qualitative research is sometimes unprepared to foster these 
types of self-expression, because it is linked to the oral form only. This constraint limits the field of 
qualitative investigation and risks keeping out of the picture information that would emerge in other 
ways (Hilppö et al. 2017). As Doerr, Mattoni and Teune (2013) single out, the visual analysis offers 
great advantages for the study of social movements: “encounters with social movements have always 
been intrinsically tied to the visual sense. [...] Social movements produce and evoke images, either 
as a result of a planned, explicit, and strategic effort, or accidentally, in an unintended or undesired 
manner” (2013: xi).  
The focus group had the duration of three hours with six participants, and it was carried out at the CS 
space. I left them free to decide which person would be part of the group, but I asked to hold it at the 
space since it was necessary for the activities. Before starting, I requested them to express how they 
felt and how they got into the focus group. I planned this icebreaking activity in accordance with their 
political effort to name and engage with emotions as a common ground for political action. Then, I 
asked them to introduce the story of their name with an image, by giving them a selection of pictures, 
among which they could pick up the one they felt was the most appropriate for their name. This first 
activity was similar to the first trajectory of the interviews, oriented to stimulate a self-reflexive stance 
in the participants with regard to their own story, choices, and experience. The activity was effective 
because, from that moment on, the stories about their background and the reasons for engaging with 
a feminist space started emerging.  
The second activity started with a question: if you were a part of this space, which one you would 
be? I gave them white papers, coloured markers, and the possibility to take pictures or move around 
the space. In half an hour, each of them produced an artifact that represented the part of the space 
they felt closer to. Then, each of them brought the group to that part, and s/he explained why it was 

87 
 
relevant for her/him. Some of them sang, others cried. That activity was coherent with the second 
trajectory of the interview, oriented to understand the participants’ experience of safe spaces, and the 
way they need and produce those type of spaces. In the third activity, I asked them to write on a Post-
it the last time they felt safe, and the last time they felt unsafe. Following that, we engaged in a 
discussion on safety from a feminist perspective. This activity corresponded to the third trajectory of 
the interview, where I tried to understand the dimension of in/out relations of feminist spaces, and 
the way a safe space engages with the outside.  In the get out activity, they were invited to make a 
sound/noise or a move, with the whole group mirroring that sound or move. In this way, we tried to 
make  collective  effort  out  of  an  individual  feeling,  and  to  get  out  of  the  focus  group  with  the 
impression of a communitarian process.  
The focus group was greatly fruitful with the case of CS in order to overcome their mistrust, to respect 
the different channels of expression of the participants, and to listen to their process of reflection on 
the question of safety, which is a kind of political discourse particularly present in their space.  
 
 
3.6 Performing Data Analysis Through Constructivist Grounded Theory and 
MAXQDA Software 
 
According to the Constructivist Grounded Theory (CGT), the iterative process of data analysis started 
with the very beginning of the fieldwork (Charmaz 2006). As soon as I began collecting fieldnotes, I 
started with the analysis. In order to perform the analysis, I engaged with MAXQDA, a software 
which allows to manage very large amount of data and codes.  
I began the initial coding on the first ten days of the ethnographic diary. Line-by-line coding was time 
consuming but fruitful in order to start engaging with the data. Through that, I created the first basket 
of codes and words, which then went on to form the future analysis. I clearly felt the saturation of 
line-by-line coding and the urge to pass to the second step of analysis. The use of the colours – made 
available by MAXQDA for each code inserted in the document – allowed me to proceed through 
nonverbal associations and junctures: step by step, I realised I was using similar colours for similar 
“areas” of thought, such as physical spaces, emotions, personal experiences, relation with the outside.  
Through focused coding, I had the chance to enucleate the first categories emerging from the analysis. 
On one hand, I gave an order to the already large number of codes (around three thousand); on the 
other, I engaged with some meaningful codes that were containing smaller codes. This process of 
category-building went on with the rest of the material. I went back and forth with the fieldwork, and 
the analysis of data progressively shaped the methodology and the methods I was engaging with. As 
Charmaz suggests (2006), the analysis of data led me to a theoretical sampling with regard to the 

88 
 
Spanish case: by following the process, I realised that the inclusion of a group which was not properly 
a space but rather a platform inhabiting several spaces of the city was worthwhile for the research. 
The constant comparative method helped me to make analytic sense of the participants’ meanings 
and actions out of their way of making sense of their own experience. It also let similarities and 
differences among cases emerge, as well as the need to better define questions, issues, and topics to 
discuss with participants. The writing of memos allowed me to fix ideas, tips, and insights emerging 
during the analysis.  
The last part of the analysis was oriented to theory building. I managed to work with three “circles,” 
the one consisting of actors, the second represented by the space, and the third made of players and 
arenas. These circles were also leaning toward different levels: the micro, the meso, and the macro. 
Within these circles, I articulated the categories that were answering to my research questions. As 
Glaser and Strauss argue (1967), painstaking coding work can at best lead to the definition of a theory, 
not necessarily a new one. In my case, saturation came with the bridge between the theory building 
through CGT and the literature on affect theory. I realised that the key to understand safe spaces lies 
in the way feminist spaces engage with affections and emotions. By working on affections (how they 
feel it, how affections arise, how they change, how they affect the interactions with others), feminist 
activists learn to name and elaborate on that. This work is a transformative process which, instead of 
what classical theories on politics and social movements claim, increases their power and political 
capacity. As CGT suggests, I started the research by “forgetting” the literature I was used to referring 
to, only going back to the literature at the end of the research process. This allowed me to start with 
“blank eyes,” a clean slate, and to let any kind of insights emerge from the participants’ words and 
data analysis. At the end of the process, I realised that part of the literature I was used to engage with 
was useful to the topic, another part not quite so, and others were missing at the beginning but 
necessary in the end, such as affect theory. The use of CGT was fully coherent with PAR, and it 
allowed me to negotiate and discuss with participants the research process. As an example, we also 
pursued two moments of collective analysis of data with the participants of CS. During the pandemic, 
after some time passed from the last interviews, we planned two more encounters. We used a free 
online platform (Jitsi Meet, considered safe enough by the participants) to connect. At the beginning 
of the meeting, I tried to explain the process of data analysis, CGT, coding, and so on. Sharing the 
more technical part of the research work with the participants was a way to stay true to the ethical 
aspiration of the research and to involve them in every step, even those normally less negotiated with 
the  participants.  Then,  I  put  on  an  online  pad  (Riseup  Pad)  some  segments  retrieved  from  their 
interviews. One of them read the segment, and together they reasoned about the best code to explain 
the segment. Even if they could not agree on a single code, they wrote under the segment various 

89 
 
codes that emerged from the exchange. Attending the discussion was a valuable moment for me to 
test the analysis process I was tackling alone, to see the data through their eyes, and to better define 
some categories I had inferred. For them, it was a moment to better understand the research and how 
it works, and also to reflect on their own collective history and the constant knowledge production 
that takes place in their community. Paradoxically, the online form, which is usually a limitation, was 
indicated by the participants as a virtue, because the distance imposed by the medium allowed them 
to release emotions and an affective immersion in their history that they would perhaps have struggled 
to do in presence.  
 
3.7 Dissemination of Results  
 
PAR requires attention to all research steps. The end of the fieldwork, although, as mentioned before, 
is a moment to be cherished, and it does not mark the end of the relationship with the participants. I 
engaged with the research, and with my relationship with participants, from the first contact until 
now. The field of the research has become an extended period of sharing and interacting well beyond 
the traditional collection of data.  
Each form of dissemination of the results was done with respect for the type of space, its attitude, 
needs, and modes of collective action. Each mode was therefore different, in accordance with the type 
of space and the relationship established with the space. In this sense, PAR is a flexible methodology, 
evolving as the research progresses, and producing heterogeneous consequences depending on the 
case. Due to the pandemic situation, as mentioned before, the PAR process was more substantial in 
Italy, and so was the dissemination of the results. 
The more I got to know and trust the participants, the more I made myself available to them, and the 
more they opened up to seek help or support. Beyond the months of intense participant observation, 
I have continued to follow many of each space's initiatives to date, as well as throughout the research 
timeframe of 2017-2021. Some moments marked the transition between the end of the fieldwork and 
the  consolidation  of  these  relationships.  For  example,  after  finishing  the  period  of  participant 
observation at LYS in August, which had been particularly intense, in September I received a call 
from one of the activists at LYS who wanted to know how I was doing and to update me on the life 
of the space, the women who are housed there and the activists. This was an emblematic moment of 
the formation of a research interaction that invests not only the field of data and information, but also 
that of affection and mutual care. Over time, I have tried to become a point of reference for the 
participants.  Every  time  they  asked  me  to  participate  to  public  meetings,  book  presentations, 
initiatives, those requests became a priority for me (even beyond academic tasks), according to the 

90 
 
ethical stance of the research. Not infrequently, I accompanied the activists to public meetings they 
had to attend just to keep them company, I made myself available for practical help, or actively 
supported the spaces in various ways. One of these was the participation of LYS activists as keynote 
speakers at the conference organised at the Scuola Normale Superiore on 21 February 2020, called 
"Feminist Strike: Struggles, Practices and Collective Reflections." On that occasion, there was an 
overlap between the spheres of academia and activism, and the wealth of knowledge produced by 
LYS opened the day of roundtables and panels.  
In order to disseminate the results, we elaborated several strategies. First, presenting the research 
findings  in  conferences  together,  and  writing  papers  together – as  in  the  case  of  the  conference 
ESPANET in 2020, when we presented and published a paper together with activists of LYS, titled 
“Re-inventing  Autonomy:  The  Experience  of  Lucha  Y  Siesta  and  the  Feminist  Methodology  in 
Combating Gender-based Violence.” Then, constantly sharing pieces of the work with participants 
and  discussing  them  together:  papers,  book  chapters,  articles,  and  so  on.  The  collaborative 
retrospective meeting on the research findings with CS activists was a meaningful occasion. With 
them, we spent six hours discussing results and future developments. In order to avoid a traditional 
oral presentation, I prepared a sort of game. On pieces of coloured cards, I wrote down 38 concepts 
which, in the results of the research, make up the concept of a safe space, and on each card I stapled 
one or two excerpts from the interviews explaining the concept. At the beginning of the meeting we 
agreed on the rules of the game. One by one, they had to turn the card over and read the excerpts from 
the interview and the concept. I would briefly explain the concept as elaborated in the research, and 
then we would all discuss it together. In the middle of the table there were a sort of buttons (indicating 
pause, let's go further, let's stop a bit more) with which the participants could express their needs 
according to the progress of the discussion. At the end, after turning over all the cards, we made an 
overall assessment of what had emerged, and each person said what had struck them most, or what 
was missing. As a result of this retrospective meeting, we agreed on some artifacts we would work 
on in the future as a result of the research findings. First, a fanzine on the history of the space, moved 
by the lack of memory on the space the activists felt. Second, a photo story on what a safe space is, 
on  the  meaning  of  safety/unsafety  from  a  feminist  perspective,  and  on  consensus  in  sexual  and 
affective interactions. Third, a science-fiction fairy tale on specific stories that happened to them. 
This way of creatively mobilising findings was the result of their attitude and of our interaction during 
the research.  
For each space, in the dissemination of results, one part was more important and others less so. In the 
case of LYS, a part of the results, related more to organisational forms and practices, was used in the 
writing of “Manifesta.” The LYS building is still at auction, and the Lazio regional government seems 

91 
 
to be the only buyer. Over the years, the regional government has built a relationship of proximity 
and exchange with LYS, and in case of purchase it would grant the management of the space to the 
activists who have been running it for thirteen years. In order to regulate this relationship with the 
Region,  and  therefore  with  the  institutions,  LYS  has  started  a  process  of  reflection  on  feminist 
commons and the writing of a sort of management charter, called “Manifesta,” which explains the 
forms, methodology, and objectives of LYS. In the writing of this charter, part of the results was 
mobilised, as well as the interviews and part of the research material. 
The dissemination process is not over, and continues in various forms, more and less public, with the 
participants. In closing, an unintended consequence also concerned me. In the research process, once 
the fieldwork was finished, I felt the need to participate in the course as an anti-violence operator of 
LYS, and to carry out the planned internship in their centres (anti-violence centre, shelter, semi-
autonomy house). This step was consistent with the relationship established with the participants, and 
allowed me and the research to develop into fields of knowledge and practice that I would never have 
imagined  at  the  beginning.  In  this  sense,  PAR  is  a  transformative  and  social  justice-oriented 
methodology that not only invests the participants, their contexts and perspectives, but the researcher 
herself.

4. Italy and Spain: Introduction to the Case Studies  
 
 
4.1 Introduction  
 
Starting from 2015, a new cycle of protests (Tarrow 1998) has been led by feminist movements 
around the globe (Cirimele and Panariello 2018, Pavan and Mainardi 2018, Chironi 2019). Europe, 
as  well,  has  been  the  stage  of  emerging  collective  action.  The  main  claims  concern  gender 
inequalities, structural gender-based violence and male-dominated structures. Concerning Southern 
European countries, two of the leading contexts in feminist mobilisations are Italy and Spain. The 
empirical part of this research project took part in their capital cities, Rome and Madrid.  
In this chapter I will introduce the political, social, and economic features of these two countries, and 
I  will  then  proceed  by  analysing  the  six feminist  spaces  where  I  carried  on  participatory  action 
research, data collection, and the empirical analysis. Firstly (4.2), I will outline the two dimensions 
of Italy and Spain: on one hand, their political landscape, social structures and economic setting. On 
the other hand, feminist legacies in both countries. For different reasons, feminist mobilisations have 
had a strong impact in the past and up until the present.  
Secondly (4.3), I will explore the socio-economic context of Rome and Madrid. 
Then  (4.4),  I  will  expose  the  first  empirical  case,  the  Casa  Internazionale  delle  Donne – CID 
(International House of Women) in Rome. It is located in the city centre of Rome, and is one of the 
most historical feminist spaces in Italy. The second case is the Casa delle donne Lucha Y Siesta – 
LYS (4.5), a multi-functional squatted centre in the most populated neighbourhood in Rome. LYS 
hosts around 15 women survivors of male violence and their children, but it also offers cultural, 
social, and political activities. The third case is the space of Cagne Sciolte – CS (“maverick” or “mad 
dog” in English: the Italian name is declined in the feminine) (4.6), a radical queer transfeminist 
squat. CS is mostly devoted to internal consciousness work on sexism, violence, and homo-lesbo-
transphobia, as well as organising or participating in external protests within public spaces. With 
regard to Spain, I will introduce the first case (4.7), the Espacios de Igualdad – EDI. They are spaces 
of equality, one for each neighbourhood, managed by the municipality and given to teams of women 
workers who are usually feminists as well. Secondly, I will present the Eskalera Karakola – EK (4.8), 
a public transfeminist house, which changed its legal and political status over time but still hosts 
several radical feminist groups and political activities. Finally, I will put forward the Plataforma 
Encuentros Bolleros – PEB (Platform of Lesbians’ Encounters) (4.9), which is not a proper space, 

93 
 
but rather a platform that cyclically passes through the spaces of various districts of Madrid, trying 
to contaminate them with its practices and discourses.  
 
4.2 Italy and Spain: Socio-Economic Context and Feminist Movements 
Trajectories 
 
Feminist spaces, as a specific repertoire of contention enacted by feminist movements, are detectable 
within  very  different  countries  and  local  context.  Libraries,  social  centres,  health  centres,  and 
women’s shelters are just few examples of collective action that allowed women to directly transform 
certain dimensions of society by the means of the action itself, without waiting for the state or other 
power holders’ solution to their issues (Busi and Fiorilli 2015, Bosi and Zamponi 2015). Bosi and 
Zamponi call these types of collective action “direct social action,” and they expand on the role of 
the  socio-economic  context  in  influencing  the  use  of  such  repertoire  of  action  (2015).  Feminist 
movements’ legacies, as well, have had an impact on current developments (Platero and Ortega-
Arjonilla  2015,  Chironi  2019,  Pavan  and  Mainardi  2018,  Barone  and  Bonu  forthcoming).  I  will 
present Italy and Spain as meaningful countries for the analysis of feminist spaces. On one hand, 
because of the economic crisis that heavily hit Southern Europe, and specifically these two countries 
(Giorgi and Caruso 2015): the crisis shaped political opportunity structures and movements’ actions 
(Bosi and Zamponi 2015, Giugni and Grasso 2018). On the other hand, because of the historical 
vitality of feminist movements (Lussana 2012, Bussoni and Perna 2014, Calabrò and Grasso 2004, 
Valiente 2002, 2013, Radcliff 2001) and contemporary mobilisations around Non Una di Meno and 
beyond.  
In September 2008, Italy was hit by the international economic crisis that still affects the social, 
political, and economic spheres (Kriesi 2012, della Porta 2013, della Porta and Mattoni 2014, Guidi 
and Andreatta 2014, Kousi and Paschou 2014, Kantola and Lombardo 2017). Some consequences at 
the European level and in Italy as well concern public debt, recession, austerity policies, labour 
market, and growing levels of unemployment and precarisation, the cuts to the welfare system and 
public services, and a decrease of economic productivity (Bosi and Zamponi 2015, Giorgi and Caruso 
2015). Spain, as well, was deeply affected by the economic crisis and austerity measures (Lombardo 
2017, Morlino and Raniolo 2017, Giugni and Grasso 2018). Consequences have been particularly 
tough  for  Spain,  due  to  a  dramatic  increase  in  unemployment,  the  economic  downturn,  and  the 
bankruptcy  of  companies  (Lombardo  and  Kantola  2017).  The  Great  Recession  triggered  the 
emergence of growing social movements and campaigns, such as the 15-M campaign and the broader 
wave of protest against austerity (Tejerina and Perugorría 2017, Portos 2019).  

94 
 
Citizens were caught by a growing vulnerability and a self-perception of precariousness (Butler 2016, 
Giorgi  and  Caruso  2015),  influencing  daily  life,  individual  choices,  collective  actions  and 
mobilisations  (Bosi  and  Zamponi  2015,  Kantola  and  Lombardo  2017). As  Chironi suggests, 
“neoliberal policies associated with this crisis have hit especially disadvantaged social categories 
(Crouch 2011, della Porta 2016, Gallino 2011, Streeck 2014, 2016), among which women, as well as 
gay, transgender, and intersexual people are to be included” (2019: 1).  
Italy is a parliamentary republic ruled by several coalitions from the 2018 general election (Lega and 
Five Star Movement; Five Star Movement and Democratic Party; a large coalition with several parties 
held together by the Prime Minister Mario Draghi). These coalitions have been oriented to a more or 
less neoliberal politics, and they faced the outbreak of the pandemic crisis, which is still ongoing. 
Spain,  instead,  is  a  parliamentary  monarchy.  From  2011  to  2018,  it  was  ruled  by  a right-wing 
government and the PP (Partido Popular) majority, while in the next elections the centre of gravity 
of voter consensus shifted largely towards the centre-left (PSOE - Partido Socialista Obrero Español) 
and left (Podemos). Despite the difficulty in finding an agreement, the left-wing parties now govern 
in a coalition (the first in the post-Francoist era), whose policies are inspired by left-wing values.  
With respect to gender politics, the two countries present very different settings. As Rosselli argues, 
“according to the European Gender Equality Index, Italy ranks among the EU countries with the 
lowest gender equality. It outperforms the EU average in only one area, health, thanks to the longevity 
of  Italian  women.  In  all  other  fields,  the  situation  is  far  from  satisfactory”  (2014:  5).  Women's 
employment rates remain low, the gender gap is still wide, reproductive labour is still partly based on 
women's unpaid work or on “the Mediterranean model of the welfare state” (Naldini 2004), the glass 
ceiling prevents women from gaining real access to top positions in the world of work, the right to 
health, and specifically the right to abortion, is strongly circumscribed by conscientious objection. 
Sexual violence against women became a crime against the person only in 1996, and stalking has 
only been prosecuted since 2009. Victims of feminicide number over a hundred every year, and one 
in three women reports having experienced harassment, violence or stalking in their lives
3
. Even 
though the legislation has partially agreed to the demands of the feminist movement (such as with the 
reform  of  family  law,  divorce,  and  abortion  law),  gender  policy  measures  often  remain 
unimplemented due to a lack of funds and resources
4
. As Rosselli goes on arguing, Italy “lacks an 
adequate infrastructure to promote gender equality. There is a lack of adequate coordination and

monitoring and evaluation tools at central level are not fully and correctly properly applied due to 
limited resources” (2014: 8).  
According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2021 of the World Economic Forum (an Index “which 
benchmarks national gender gaps on economic, political, education and health criteria, and provides 
country rankings that allow for effective comparisons across regions and income groups, and over 
time”
5
), Spain ranks 14th and Italy 63rd. According to the Gender Equality Index, compiled by the 
European Institute for Gender Equality, the balance between women and men in care activities is 
increasing, as well as the presence of women in positions of power (as an example, Spain introduced 
a gender quota of 40% in 2007). However, the gender pay gap persists and women’s risk of poverty 
is much higher than men; moreover, they keep being relegated to feminised sectors of education and 
employment
6
. In 2004, Zapatero’s government approved the Ley Orgánica 1/2004, 28 de dicembre, 
de Medidas de Protección Integral contra la Violencia de Género, which identifies gender-based 
violence  as  a  structural  phenomenon  and  establishes  substantial  funds  and  resources  to  fight  it. 
Feminist politicians have been part of political parties since the 1970s, and their presence (both in 
electoral competition and in government) strongly influenced institutional policies and measures. 
From 1983, the Instituto de las Mujeres promotes and fosters the conditions that enable the social 
equality  of  both  sexes  and,  on  the  other  hand,  the  participation  of  women  in  political,  cultural, 
economic and social life, in attachment to the Ministry of Equality, through the Secretary of State for 
Equality  and  against  Gender  Violence.  However,  institutions  in  Spain  work  through  a  strong 
decentralisation, thus many policies and services are ruled by local authorities and regions. 
With respect to these socio-economic and political settings, feminist movements have often pursued 
forms of direct social action in order to go beyond the State’s brokerage. As Bosi and Zamponi stress, 
in the last years there has been “an increase in forms of participation that ignore or circumvent the 
traditional state-addressing repertoires of action, and that focus instead on a 'self- changing' society 
as part of everyday politics, in which the distinction between the public and private spheres is blurred 
(Kousis and Paschou 2014). Alternative forms of resilience, mutualism and prefigurative politics are 
different  labels  that  often  define  the  same  set  of  phenomena”  (2015:  368-369).  The  feminist 
movements’ repertoire of contention in the last years is often direct social actions, such as feminist 
spaces: beyond claiming something from the state, they transform some aspects of society through 
action. However, feminist movements engaged with DSA starting from the 1970s, in a phase of high 
mobilisation, by opening anti-violence centres and health clinics. Feminist movements in Italy have 
a  strong  and  deeply-rooted  tradition,  going  back  to  the  1960s.  They  first  emerged  through

consciousness  rising  groups  or  women’s sections  inside  movements  or  parties  (Lussana  2012, 
Passerini 1991, Melandri 2000, Stellifferi 2015). From the beginning, they framed gender relations, 
inequalities, and roles as the key factor of female subordination and subalternity (Firestone 1970, 
Lonzi 1974, Libreria delle donne di Milano 1987, Melandri 2000). Struggles for reproductive rights 
and abortion, the right to divorce, civil and political rights on one hand, and for the subversion of the 
entire  male-based  structure  of  society  on  the  other,  were  the  core  claims  and  triggers  for  action 
(Banotti 1971, Calabrò and Grasso 2004, Bertilotti and Scattigno 2005); and they eventually produced 
cultural and political outcomes (Percovich 2005).  
The legacies of those movements are strongly tied to contemporary upsurges, both because of their 
political continuity, and because of the participation of the older generation of activists. Today's 
feminist spaces are the result of that legacy, and they show the continuity of this type of action within 
feminist movements (Barone and Bonu forthcoming). After the feminicide of Sara di Pietrantonio in 
Rome in 2016, a new cycle of feminist mobilisations emerged, called Non Una di Meno, linked to 
the Argentinian women’s movements against gender violence. The movement saw the convergence 
of historical feminists, collectives, women’s shelters, queer and LGBT collectives, social centres, 
associations, and feminist counselling centres (Chironi 2019, Barone and Bonu forthcoming). Soon, 
through public protests and marches – like the march against gender violence on 25 November and 
the feminist strike on 8 March – and the proliferation of local assemblies beside the national one, the 
movement became larger, more visible and widely recognised.  
With regard to Spain, the right-wing authoritarian regime ruled from the mid-1930s to 1975 and it 
deeply  affected  democratisation  processes  and  women’s  struggles  and  rights  (Valiente  2013). 
Depending  on  state  re-configuration – the  distribution  of  power  from  central  state  authority  to 
territorial level; the delegation of authority to European Union, and the redistribution of power among 
governmental  departments – and  actual  configuration  (a  parliamentary  monarchy),  feminist 
movements  changed  over  the  last  two  decades,  manly  addressing  the  regional  and  EU  levels 
(Threlfall,  Cousins  and  Valiente  2005).  Strongly  rooted  in  local  contexts,  feminist  movements 
achieved growing relevance that still endures nowadays. As many other European countries, Spain 
has been influenced by global cycle of mobilisations around gender violence and gender inequalities, 
joining the transnational call on feminist strike with mass mobilisations and public protests (Portos 
2019, Campillo 2019).  
In the framework of the 15-M, social centres, occupations, health clinics, and self-managed spaces 
emerged as a form of direct social action, by targeting the crisis and the broader male-based neoliberal 
setting (Gámez Fuentes 2015). As rooms of active democracy, feminist spaces pursued prefigurative 

97 
 
politics and grassroot services, and they became key actors in recent mobilisations (Threlfall, Cousins 
and Valiente 2005).  
 
 
4.3 Rome and Madrid 
 
Rome and Madrid are two capital cities with several similarities and differences. Both of them have 
a large surface area, and a population of around 3 million with very high density.  
From 2016 to 2021, Rome was ruled by the Five Star Movement with the mayor Virginia Raggi. The 
city is crossed by strong social inequalities, dividing one part of the city with a certain degree of 
wealth, and another that suffers in terms of housing, employment, income, poverty, urban transport 
network, health, and access to services (Lelo, Monni and Tomassi 2019). The weakening of social 
policies at both national and local level has severely affected this part of the city where, over time, 
struggles for the right to housing and grassroot social movements have tried to invent answers, more 
or less in conflict or collaboration with the local administration. These data have a particular impact 
on those sectors of the population considered fragile, such as women and LGBTQ individuals, who 
pay the highest price for inequalities and the economic and pandemic crisis (Zanfrini 2005, Toffanin, 
Pietrobelli e Misiti 2020, Demurtas, Peroni e Mauri 2020). Due to its sprawling extension, the Roman 
social and administrative context is strongly organised by neighbourhoods, which have their own 
contextual realities and identities. The municipality and the regional government manage most of the 
public anti-violence centres. Part of them is run by feminist-inspired cooperatives and associations. 
According to the Istanbul Convention, the municipality of Rome should guarantee 300 shelter places 
in relation to the size of the population, but at the moment it only guarantees 26. Compared to these 
numbers, an occupied place like LYS covers 60% of the sleeping accommodations currently available 
in Rome for women fleeing violence. Despite the presence of a service such as “Pari Opportunità” 
(equal  opportunities)  managed  by  the  city  council
7
,  great  distances  persist  between  feminist 
movements and the institutions: as an example, the city council was the first actor attacking FS (such 
as  CID  and  LYS).  Since  2019,  the  Lazio  regional  government  has  approved  a  regional  law  on 
common  goods  that  promotes  the  shared  administration  of  common  goods  through  forms  of 
collaboration between the regional administration, local authorities, and active citizens, aimed at the 
care,  regeneration,  and  shared  management  of  the  goods  themselves.  The  regional  government 
generally shows a higher sensitivity than the city council with regard to the relation with associations 
and movements on the ground of gender violence (Pietrobelli et al. 2020).

98 
 
From 2015 to 2019, Madrid was ruled by a leftist mayor, Manuela Carmena, while from 2019 the 
election turned to right-wing governments and by now, the town council of Isabel Díaz Ayuso (PP) 
is supported by Vox, an extreme right party. Carmena’s work was inspired by a strong reflection on 
municipalism, which “is based on the assumption that municipalities can be the elementary political 
unit of a dimension built from the bottom up. Municipalism identifies municipal democracy as a 
fundamental instance of a model of democracy that (tendentially) defines itself as emancipatory with 
respect to the monopoly of politics by the state and representation as the classic form of liberal 
democracy” (Rodriguez 2017).
8
 Hopes for radical change in the wake of 15-M soon clashed with the 
reticence of the mechanisms of institutional politics, which never fully embraced the prospect of a 
participatory government in Madrid. Strong inequalities persist, and the organisation in 20 districts 
reproduces the differences between the centre and peripheries. The city council of Madrid has been 
strongly engaged in gender politics and gender equality provisions. The inclusion of people coming 
from  feminist  movements  into  the  apparatus  favoured  a  growing  sensitivity  of  the  municipality 
toward gender-based violence and gender inequalities. As an example, the 2018-2020 strategic plan 
of the city council is oriented “toward a feminist city,” including four main fields of intervention: 
public  action  with  a  gender-integrated  approach;  freeing  the  city  from  male  violence;  the 
sustainability of life; employment and co-responsibility; women's participation and new forms of 
leadership. Moreover, the city council manages seventeen Espacios de Igualdad (spaces of equality), 
almost one for each district, that I will later explore. Despite the situation changing because of the 
right-wing  attacks  toward  gender  politics,  Madrid’s  institutions  incorporate  a  deep  awareness  of 
gender in public policy and an extensive commitment to services, resources, and attention to sectors 
of the population such as women and LGBTQ people.

The International House of Women is the historical space of feminist movements in Rome since the 
1980s. Previously, in 1976, the Movimento di Liberazione della Donna (Movement for the liberation 
of woman), linked to the Partito Radicale (radical party), occupied a House of Women in Via del 
Governo Vecchio, in the city centre (Pomeranzi 1982, Stelliferi 2015). Slowly, all feminist groups, 
organisations, and collectives of Rome (such as the MFR – Movimento Femminista Romano, in Via 
Pompeo Magno) started to gather there, and made the place a key space for feminist organisations 
and coordination (Fiorensoli 1999). 
After the eviction, carried out by the municipality, feminist movements kept claiming another space. 
In 1987, they occupied part of the old Buon Pastore building, an historical penitentiary for women 
charged of moral accusations, founded in the 17
th
 century, situated in Via della Lungara, in the central 
neighbourhood of Trastevere. At the beginning, several feminist groups, such as Centro Femminista 
Separatista - CFI  (Separatist  Feminist centre)  and  Collegamento  Lesbiche  Italiane - CLI  (Italian 
Lesbian Connection), gathered together in order to manage the space. In 1992, the House was listed 
as one of the works of Roma Capitale, and at the beginning of 2000 it was officially assigned to the 
women managing it by the municipality, with a deal and a rent. Formally, women are allowed to 
manage a portion of the building equal to 19,000 square metres. From 2002, AFFI - Associazione 
Federativa  Femminista  Internazionale  (International  Federative  Feminist  Association)  and  CFI 
manage the activities of the Consorzio Casa Internazionale delle Donne, which has economic and 
managerial  responsibilities  on  the  building.  The  Consorzio  included  a  variable  number  of 
associations, from fifty to today’s twenty-eight. These associations have their basis at the House and 
they take part in the daily life and activities of the space. Their interest and purpose range from 
reproductive  rights  and  women’s  health,  psychological  and  family  assistance,  gender-sensitive 
communication,  to  help  in  work,  education  to  gender  and  differences,  managing  the  archives  of 
women’s history, women’s culture and art, legal assistance, feminist editorial products. So far, the 
House is the biggest experiment of women management of a space in Italy, and is still one of the most 
important political experiences for women in Rome and beyond.  
Nowadays,  beside  the  associations’  offices,  there  is  a  conference  centre,  a  hostel  for  women,  a 
restaurant, a space for children, other spaces for gym activities, and a garden. The House hosts the 
daily activities of associations, but also a “sportello sociale” (social reception), events, concerts, 
festivals, presentations, seminars, conferences. Along these activities, the House is managed by a 
Direttivo  (a  board  of  several  women  elected  by  the  assembly)  and  the  general  assembly  of  the 
Consorzio, with all the associations’ representatives.  
The  4000  square-metre  Buon  Pastore  building,  managed  by  feminist  activists,  associations  and 
groups, changed many times the organisational and political status of the House. The building has the 

100 
 
typical  structure  of  a  penitentiary,  with  a  central  courtyard  surrounded  by  the  four  wings  of  the 
building. Spanning three floors, it has hundreds of small rooms with one or more windows on the 
courtyard – these rooms used to be cells where women prisoners were trapped in. This peculiar 
structure also tended to shape the practical organisation and the political activities of the feminist 
groups crossing this space.  
At the end of 2017, the municipality sent an official letter of eviction because of an unresolved debt 
(since women paid less than the agreed rent), and a supposed illegal occupation of the building. Since 
then, a large mobilisations of women, feminist movements, and citizens rose up in order to defend 
the  House.  At  the  moment  of  writing  this  thesis,  the  negotiation  between  the  House  and  the 
municipality is still ongoing.  
 
4.4.2 Lucha Y Siesta: Recovery and Rest against Gender-Based Violence 
Revolution needs time  
and doesn’t leave anyone behind  
(Qandil’s women in Lucha Y Siesta 2016: 5) 
 
Together is a wonderful place to shelter 
(Lucha’s flyer) 
 
The idea of a women’s occupation was born within the framework of Action, a social movement 
based in Rome mainly focused on housing rights and occupation of houses and buildings as the main 
tool of contention. Women activists of the group started noticing that a lot of the women asking for 
help to the Action front desk were involved in cases of domestic violence or structural gender-based 
violence, and that a women-only occupation was necessary. They founded a women-only group, 
Action-A, specifically devoted to addressing the issue.  
On 8 March 2008, more than forty women occupied the space in Via Lucio Sestio 10. At that time, 
the place was an empty warehouse, although it used to be a car deposit and offices of Atac, the 
company managing public transports in Rome, which is also the owner of the building. The building 
spans three floors, with a terrace on top, is surrounded by a garden, and is encircled by a few blocks. 
Built  in  1920,  it  was  abandoned  since  the  1970s.  The  place  is  located  at  the  VII  municipality 
(Tuscolano neighbourhood), one of the most populous neighbourhoods in Italy, affected by relevant 
social and economic issues. 
On 8 March, the International Day of Women, activists entered with a banner: “Among the feast, the 
ritual, the silence, we choose the fight.” The name is a play on the geographical location (just outside 
the metro station Lucio Sestio), and to the Spanish terms for the act of fighting and rest, deeply rooted 

101 
 
in  Lucha’s  movement  culture,  also  borrowed  from  Zapatistas’  political  background.  Since  the 
beginning, Lucha Y Siesta (LYS) started hosting around 20 women and their children, but the number 
changed over time. At the time of the fieldwork, LYS hosted fourteen women and seven children. 
The space is meant to be a “symbolic and material place of women’s self-determination against all 
discrimination based on gender” (About Us, on their site).
9
 They are “a model of active citizenship, 
an example of social solidarity and a civil and cultural proposal” (Lucha’s flyer). Over the years, 
Lucha promoted new welfare experiments and women’s rights, presenting as a hybrid project across 
women’s shelter, semi-autonomy house, and political house of women. Among their activities, they 
offer information, guidance, support, listening, and reception to women in need, though the space is 
also a space of culture, politics, entertainment, art.  
The organisation of the Houses constantly changed over time, but is now structured through the 
political assembly of LYS’s activists, the management assembly with all the women that live at LYS, 
and the assembly of the “operatrici” (women operators), who follow the women hosted in the house 
and the women looking for help at the front desk.  
Nowadays, LYS offers around fifteen accommodations for women escaping male violence, a centre 
of listening and hospitality, the “Lucia Perez” women’s shelter (a semi-autonomous house, located 
outside  LYS  itself),  a  library,  a  project  against  stereotypes,  a  psychological  supporting  centre, 
several–courses (music, languages, gym, theatre), and a sartorial laboratory.  
After Atac declared bankruptcy, most of the company’s properties, among which is LYS, have been 
claimed to be sold in order to solve the company’s debt. LYS received the official letter of eviction 
and detachment of utilities planned on 15 September 2019. In order to defend the space, LYS’s 
activists called for a huge mobilisation through the citizen committee “Lucha alla Città” and the 
proposal of a popular participated purchase of Lucha (the building is indeed expected to be sold at 
auction). During the last phase of the research, the Lazio regional government put forward a proposal 
to buy LYS at auction and to give it to activists to manage through a commons management pact.

The name of Cagne Sciolte (“mavericks” or “dogs without leash,” in the feminine form in Italian) 
defines a group – or rather a pack – of activists, ranging from very different movement cultures – 
social centres, feminist collectives, anarchist assemblies, politicised art scene, or people who engaged 
in politics for the first time. The meaning of the name refers to different dimensions. On one hand, 
using the feminine form is a provocative stance against the universal male language from a feminist 
and transfeminist standpoint. On the other hand, the name claims a specific political behaviour and 
political method, carrying the meaning of being “disbanded.” They do not refer to traditional forms 
of collective action, and they reject the male repertoire of action in social movements. Everyone is 
free to act and talk for his/her/themself, and the group is made up of free individuals who choose to 
or  abstain  from  fighting  together;  they  come  from  very  different  movement  cultures  (anarchist, 
libertarian, Trotskyist, communist, and so on) which co-exist in the fight against sexism, homo-lesbo-
transphobia and gendered violence; finally, they have a sensitivity towards environmental and animal 
rights and the habit of living everyday life and activities with animals – especially dogs –  held as an 
inner part of their political community. The group defines itself as queer and transfeminist, bridging 
academic reflections and movement’s production of knowledge: the subjects of feminist politics are 
not exclusively cisgender women (individuals whose assigned sex at birth was female and who self-
identify as women), but also trans women and men, lesbian women, gay men, non-binary people and 
so on. The composition of the group, indeed, is heterogeneous, with a majority of lesbian women at 
the time of the fieldwork.  
The group, angry at male social movement patterns and at the urban exclusionary patterns of Rome, 
started meeting in the neighbourhood of San Lorenzo and decided to occupy a feminist space together 
on 14 December 2013. The space was a dismissed night club in the neighbourhood Ostiense, in the 
south of Rome: it was a proper building with a bar, a stage, poles for pole dancing, rooms, and a 
basement.  
The space is managed by a weekly assembly of activists. From almost the beginning, the basement 
was used as an anti-violence front desk called “Una stanza tutta per sé” (a room of one’s own), rooted 
in a university feminist collective called Ribellule. The front desk was meant to offer supportive talks, 
hospitality, and legal advice. Over the years, the space (called the space of Cagne Sciolte) became a 
laboratory for radical thought and practices, mainly focused on reproductive and sexual rights, trans 
people’s  struggles,  self-care  and  body  acceptance,  the  claim  on  sexual  liberation  and  non-
monogamies  against  romantic  and  heteronormative  love,  an  anti-racist  stance,  the  fight  against 
prisons and repressive policies, and anti-authoritarian actions. Moreover, the space of Cagne Sciolte 
hosts  a  vegan  trattoria,  self-organised  pole  dancing  courses,  festivals,  events,  cabaret,  and  self-
financing activities.  

103 
 
Their repertoire of contention is inspired by a deeply anti-authoritarian standpoint, oriented toward a 
radical critique of institutions, the public health system, male-dominated movements, male culture, 
and capitalism. Actions beyond the space have been focused on subversive urban practices – such as 
slut walks; night walks against violence; creative protests (like urinating together in front of the 
Ministry of Healthcare), often anonymously. Internally, a deep collective reflection on gender-based 
violence and same-sex violence has been undertaken, through the creation of cycles of workshops 
and practical activities.  
In 2015, the ACEA company proceeded to the detachment of electricity, and the municipality always 
threatens  the  space  of  eviction.  So  far,  the  ambiguous  legal  status  of  the  building  (which  was 
confiscated  from  the  former  owner  for  exploitation  of  illegal  prostitution)  guaranteed  the  non-
compliance of that threat.  
 
4.4.4 The Espacios de Igualdad: Top-down Houses of Women  
 
The  Espacios  de  Igualdad  are  municipal  public  resources  of  proximity,  implemented  in  the 
neighbourhood  and  social  fabric  of  the  districts  of  Madrid,  and  whose  services  are  aimed  at  all 
citizens.  Starting  from  2002,  the  city  council  of  Madrid  created  the  Consejo  de  las  Mujeres  del 
Municipio  de  Madrid.  The  committee  was  oriented  to  support  organisations  and  associations  of 
women, and to include a gendered perspective in the policies and action of the city council
11
. From 
then on, the city council implemented measures, resources, provisions, and interventions in the field 
of women’s empowerment and gender equality. Within the Government Area of Families, Equality 
and  Welfare,  the  Directorate  General  for  Equality  Policies  and  Against  Gender  Violence  is 
responsible  for  implementing  policies  to  promote  equality  and  non-discrimination,  as  well  as 
measures to empower women, to reduce the gender gap, and to prevent gender-based violence. The 
opening of the Espacios de Igualdad was part of this project, and there was supposed to be one for 
each district. Progressively, the municipal network of EDIs in the city of Madrid opened 17 centres 
(in 20 districts in total), located in the districts of Arganzuela, Barajas, Carabanchel, Chamartín, 
Chamberí, Ciudad Lineal, Fuencarral - El Pardo, Hortaleza, Moratalaz, Retiro, San Blas-Canillejas, 
Tetuán, Usera, Vicálvaro, Villa de Vallecas, and Villaverde.  
In this context, the Municipal Network of Equality Spaces is the main resource for the territorial 
development of the policy for the promotion of equality in the city of Madrid. The EDIs’ activities 
are oriented to several goals: raising public awareness of gender equality; facilitating individual and

collective processes of women’s empowerment and recognising their diversity; prevention, detection, 
and reparation of gender-based violence.  
The municipality of Madrid contracts out the management of the spaces to cooperatives, associations, 
and private organisations. These cooperatives are usually of feminist orientation, and they manage 
the spaces according to explicitly feminist principles. However, the practical management takes place 
between the private and public, as the municipality provides the two-year programmes and the lines 
of intervention within which the individual EDI teams have to plan the activities of the space. For the 
development  of  these  lines  of  action,  and  through  their  interdisciplinary  professional  teams,  the 
Spaces offer individualised support services to women (psychological and social care, legal guidance, 
and professional development), and organise group and community activities (through the school of 
empowerment and the school of equality).  
The EDIs are designed as spaces for the support and empowerment of women in all their diversity, 
in order to be able to confront the different gender-based violence and discomfort generated by a 
normative model of society. But they are also spaces for promoting equal opportunities and equality 
between men and women. Two types of activities are carried out. On the one hand, the equality 
school,  which  includes  all  those  activities  that  are  aimed  at  men  and  women,  and  with  them 
professionals of minor resources. The aim is to raise awareness on violence and gender imperatives. 
Then, they elaborate actions and services to support women so that they can confront male violence, 
in a two-fold manner. They offer specialised care services, individual care services, a psychologist, a 
lawyer, and a professional development technician, available through individual appointments, in 
order  to  help  women  to  solve,  for  example,  a  divorce  process,  a  dismissal  process,  or  to  face 
difficulties in finding a job, preparing a CV, knowing how to deal with the labour market, and so on. 
Secondly, a part of the EDIs is dedicated to dynamising educators who generate training spaces, 
aimed at women to work on the different dimensions of their life (job, body, health, migration, gender, 
and so on).  
As an activist told me, these are considered the House of women of the 21
st
 century. This is the result 
of the historical balance reached between State feminism and the autonomous movements in the 
Spanish context, and the experience of Spanish municipalism.  
 
4.4.5 Eskalera Karakola: Public Transfeminist House, Longstanding Occupation 
 
This idea is not only about denouncing an inequality relation, but rather about empowering all the 
possible “ways of being women” that do not exist, that are not expressed, that are not invented and 
are made invisible in “neutral” spaces.  
(Eskalera Karakola’s website) 

105 
 
 
The Eskalera Karakola (EK) is an historical feminist space in Madrid. First squatted in 1996 in the 
Lavapiès neighbourhood, it changed location in 2005, moving to Calle Embajador. Now, through a 
legal deal, they are allowed to manage the space by paying a monthly rent.  
The EK is inspired by principles of autonomy, self-management, and feminism. It was born from a 
“political  desire”  (from  Eskalera  Karakola’s  website)
12
 to  share  spaces  and  lives,  to  better  think 
together, to re-invent the world through a feminist view. The number of women managing the space 
is variable, and some of them are the same that originally squatted the space. They are all united by 
the will to grow together and carry on a daily feminist practice deeply rooted in the neighbourhood’s 
life. The space is managed by a weekly assembly. Feminism is one of the main topics, but they also 
developed other political issues, such as precariat and work conditions, the right to the citizenship of 
migrant people, LGBTQ rights, and so on. The group is the co-organiser of the annual pride parade 
in the city.  
At the beginning, the space was called “Kasa Okupada por y para Mujeres,” and only later it became 
“Kasa Publica de Mujeres.” It is open to whoever wants to join, spend some time there, or propose 
projects and activities. The EK is self-financed with members’ quotas and individual donations. They 
have been involved in several projects, such as a project toward women’s technological education, 
with relevant grants that allowed them to buy computer and audio-visual equipment.  
In the former location, the space was much more centrally managed, whereas after the move they 
made projects and activities more independent. Management assemblies are separatist and handled 
only by women, but activities are usually opened to everyone.  
In the spaces there are a lot of different activities and groups, such as a group on feminist economy, 
an agricultural cooperative, a hacklab on feminist technologies, a self-defence group for women, a 
group of trans people to fight sexual harassment in the neighbourhood, a group of migrant women, a 
transfeminist reading group. The EK has been the site where relevant groups were created, such as 
the group Precarias a la Deriva, that worked on women’s precarisation and work conditions, and the 
group Territorio Domestico, composed of mainly migrant women working as domestic workers or 
caregivers. Because of its history and relevance in the feminist movements in Madrid, the EK brings 
together extensive support from the inhabitants, who, although not participating on a daily basis, are 
always present in the financing of the site, though emotional, material, and political support, and in 
public initiatives.

4.4.6 Plataforma Encuentros Bolleros: a multiple platform of Radical Bisexual and Lesbian 
People  
 
Back to the barricades together [...] In love and with company. 
(Interviews to Tatiana and Lara, 2019)
13
 
 
In their official page, Plataforma Encuentros Bolleros is described as “a network of dykes in which 
to put forward proposals and actions that position us as political subjects.”
14
 The Platform started to 
meet in 2018, because of the need to discuss and meet among lesbian, bisexual, queer, and feminist 
people. The need for this space arose from their dissatisfaction with the political landscape in which, 
on  the  one  hand,  feminist  movements  seemed  to  lack  a  radical  perspective  on  sexuality  and 
lesbianism,  and,  on  the  other  hand,  mainstream  LGBT  movements  lacked  an  anti-capitalist  and 
critical  perspective.  Outside  the  institutional  spaces,  which  were  not  considered  as  trustworthy 
interlocutors, a platform was thus born, aimed at bringing together those who identify themselves as 
lesbian, bisexual, queer, and feminist. 
Unlike the other cases included in the research, the Platform is not tied to a physical space. In fact, it 
is a political place that meets in various spaces, each time different, in several neighbourhoods of 
Madrid. The  choice  to  include  this  case  depends  on  several  reasons.  First,  because  of  the 
characteristics of its political work, which is strongly focused on the creation of safe spaces. Secondly, 
because of its political orientation, aimed at critically questioning the field of sexuality and violence, 
in a manner quite similar to that of Cagne Sciolte. Thirdly, because the Platform represents the aspect 
of the proliferation of safe spaces – which I will elaborate on later – untying the concept from the 
existence  of  a  physical  space,  and  extending  this  possibility  to  all  the  spaces  that  the  political 
community in question crosses. Somehow, I felt it was representative of a certain Spanish political 
culture, which has elaborated innovative reflections and practices in the field of safe spaces, going 
beyond the specific, hyper-politicised formations, and blurring the construction of safe spaces in a 
more extensive and molecular way wherever a reflection on the political takes place. 
The Platform is intended to have several functions. Firstly, it aims to be a meeting place for lesbian, 
bisexual, queer, and feminist people. Secondly, it is meant to be a place of self-awareness and mutual 
care, where experiences can be shared and a common thread and political translation can be found. 
Thirdly, it calls for the elaboration of political practices and protests in public space, such as on 8 
March and on 28 June, known in the space as Critical Pride Day. Sexuality is experienced as a

battlefield, and not as something “people are born with.” Furthermore, the Platform means to speak 
out in the public debate, as in the case of the Ley Trans, and to combat some of the drifts of State 
feminism towards essentialist positions. The Platform is also a place of memory and preservation of 
an archive of lesbian actions and affects. Finally, it is a place for creating moments of leisure, fun, 
and encounters in which lesbian and bisexual people can feel comfortable. The most famous banner 
of the Platform that they always bring in public protests reads “We exist and we resist.”  
One of the first public initiatives of the Platform was the #Fachitour, on the occasion of 8 March 
2019. On that occasion, the Platform organised a mock tour in the Salamanca neighbourhood, where 
several PP and Vox offices are located. The platform staged a tour passing in front of each of their 
headquarters with disguises, glitter, and parodic reversals of far-right discourses. The initiative, which 
attracted a lot of attention in Madrid, aimed to denounce, from a lesbian and critical perspective, the 
discourses of the extreme right, and neoliberal and capitalist drifts.  
In May 2020, during the lockdown for the pandemic outbreak, the Platform organised two days of 
online debates on various topics, such as lesbian desire, the rationalisation of trans and queer people, 
and the generational experience of lesbian people. The days were attended by many people, allowing 
the Platform to reach a larger audience beyond the Madrid context, to spread their thoughts and to 
promote the very existence of the Platform.

Part II: Grounding Concepts in Data: The Empirical Analysis through 
CGTM 
 
 
 
5. Agency and Structure 
 
 
5.1 Introduction  
 
The question of the political opportunity structure and movement action, or more specifically the 
relationship between structure and agency, has been debated for a long time in social movement 
studies, and it still is (Tarrow 1998, McAdam, Tarrow and Tilly 2001, Meyer 2004). Critiques to 
political process theory have been put forward with regard to the overly-broad definition of political 
opportunities that do not take into consideration the differences in contexts, the lack of the cultural 
dimension, and the misleading idea of a (solely) rational social actor (Goodwin and Jasper 2009, 
Marx Ferree et al. 2002, Koopmans and Olzak 2004, Gould 2009). Scholars turned their attention to 
specific  mechanisms  that  link  structure  and  agency  (Jasper 2012),  and  how  (sometimes)  social 
movements bring about structural change (Koopmans 2005).  
In this chapter, I will begin the journey into the empirical analysis of feminist spaces (FSs), and the 
role of affects as a mediating mechanism between the structure and agency of spaces. The argument 
of this research is that conscious work on affects constitutes the political practice developed within 
FSs, and that this practice does not depower collective action, but, on the contrary, it increases the 
capacity for collective action. To explore how the increase of the potential for collective action comes 
to be, I will look at the structure FSs relate with, and the interaction they enact.  
The  research  took  place  between  2017  and  2021:  in  those  years,  almost  all  FSs  included  in  the 
research were undertaking a period of crisis because of the institutional, economic, and legal attacks 
on FSs. Moreover, changes in local and national administrations and the outbreak of the pandemic 
crisis heavily constrained opportunities for movement action. Differently than public protests and 
ephemeral collective action, FSs are interesting sites of analysis to look at the continuity of collective 
action (Taylor 1989) and at the development of strategies and tactics with regard to dynamic structural 
changes. In current unfavourable conditions, FSs developed strategies and tactics grounded in the 
political  use  of  affects.  This  choice,  that  brought  together  the  nonconscious,  noncognitive,  and 
nonlinguistic quality of affects (Gould 2009), rational calculation, and a conscious use of emotions, 
allowed them to develop innovative, challenging, and (sometimes) successful strategies to deal with 

109 
 
an unfavourable structure. Despite the historical removal of affects as pure irrational displays, the 
cases under investigation suggest that a recomposition in the analysis between the unpredictability of 
collective  affects,  a  collective  and  conscious  work  on  emotions,  and  rational  choices  can  more 
systematically account for agency and for the mechanisms occurring between agency and structure 
(Gould 2009).  While emotions have been taken into account at the individual level, quite influenced 
by psychology and its categorisation (Jasper 2018), I am here referring to the relational and social 
dimension of affects as a concept capable to explain the mechanisms that link structure and agency. 
How do the FSs’ affective strategies interplay with structure? How do FSs put affects into action in 
relation to institutions, law, norms, values, and beliefs? Here I will explore how this process happens 
at the macro level. First, I will explore the structure of crisis and neoliberal changes that affects FSs, 
and their development of strategies that, eventually, produce slight structural change. To account for 
these structural changes, I will specifically investigate FSs as feminist economies and institutions 
from below. In the second part, I will look at the interaction between FSs and several players at the 
local, national, and international level, and with regard to the feminist movements. By mobilising 
affects, FSs engage with alliances and conflict and they strengthen their potential for collective action 
at several layers and with different actors.  
 
Building Safer Spaces in Times of Crisis, Neoliberalism, and Structural Violence 
The chapter aims to look at the strategies and tactics developed by FSs with regard to structure and 
political opportunities. But which kind of structure am I referring to? The spaces analysed by the 
research are physical places, located in urban contexts. They were created in response to a number of 
issues: male violence against women as the cornerstone of social structures; the consequences of 
neoliberalism on women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people; the lack of spaces and services for 
women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people. From this first consideration we can identify elements 
that make up the structure with which FSs interact. First, male violence against women. Second, 
neoliberalism as an economic, social, cultural, and political system. Third, the local and national 
management of public policies, rights, governance.  
According to the main institute of statistics in Italy (ISTAT), the 30% of women aged 16-70 report 
to have experienced episodes of gender-based violence. In the scope of gender-based violence they 
include physical, verbal, psychological, sexual violence
15
. In Italy, from 2017 to 2021 (the time-span 
of this research), over 100 women per year were killed by their partners or relatives, and the same 
goes for Spain
16
. As Gago, Malo and Cavallero explain, there is a close correlation between gender-

based violence and capitalism, which feminist movements have pointed to as a counterpart, even 
beyond the State: “the complexity of exploitation and domination is thus made visible in a way that 
does not result in impotence or cynicism, but rather highlights and disseminates the subjective and 
everyday articulations as a strategic factor in confronting the logics of violent accumulation of capital. 
That  is:  the  feminist  movement  has  actualized,  in  a  popular  feminist  pedagogy,  the  organic 
relationship between violence against women and feminized bodies and the accumulation of capital, 
and has done so from a practice of insubordination” (2020: 18-19). On one hand, because of the way 
economic structures are shaped upon social structures. As a consequence, the economic and financial 
structures  reproduce  marginalisation,  gender  pay  gap,  indebtedness.  On  the  other  hand,  from  an 
historical point of view, because of the way the accumulation of capital is built upon the subalternity 
of women. In her inquiry on the transition from feudalism to capitalism during the 16
th
 and 17
th
 
centuries, Federici (2004) argues that the emerging social and economic systems were grounded on 
the exploitation of women and on witch-hunting. The accumulation of capital was enhanced through 
the implementation of enclosures and through the re-collocation of women in the private space, by 
dispossessing them of their capacities, social skills, knowledge, and role in the community. Whoever 
exceeded the emerging gender norms was considered deviant and burned at the stake. Moreover, the 
production of the work force in the new capitalist system was to be reproduced by the invisible work 
of women. In The Power of Women and the Subversion of the Community, Maria Rosa Dalla Costa 
(1971) sketches out a critique of Marxist orthodoxy, by proving that women’s unpaid work at home 
was the pillar on which the exploitation of waged labour and the capitalist productivity was built 
upon. Since then, the exploitation of women in the capitalist setting has changed form but not nature 
(Cornwall, Gideon and Wilson 2008). By addressing the materialist side of women’s oppression, 
feminist movements have targeted social reproduction, on one hand, and the gendered economic and 
financial exploitation, on the other.  
As a matter of fact, FSs have picked up the baton of the struggle against gender-based violence and 
against its interplay with the neoliberal setting.  
Moreover, all the spaces included in the research are dealing with a political crisis and the threat of 
eviction. Local administrations do strategically take advantage of FSs (e.g. when there is a lack of 
accommodation for women in shelters and women escaping violence are informally delegated to 
FSs), but they strategically attack them in other circumstances. In this context, FSs have to develop 
effective  strategies  with  regard  to  changing  political  opportunities.  Despite  the  crisis  having  the 
potential to become only a constraint, or a distorting factor in the FSs' repertoire of tactics, it is 
precisely  in  this  context  that  FSs  consolidate  and  innovate  their  strategy  through  the  work  on 
collective affects. Inside and outside of the spaces, strategies, networks, and goals are shaped through 

111 
 
the mediation of affects. The time, content, and orientation of collective action changes according to 
the use of affects, that often lead to innovative or unexpected solutions. Slowing down; strategically 
changing interlocutors; consolidating creative models of intervention; developing caring relationships 
with the urban context; identifying individuals within the wider governmental structure with whom 
to develop relationships of affection, recognition, and care, are just some of the strategies embedded 
in the work on collective affects.  
While public protests address the issue through eventful moments (della Porta 2008), FSs elaborate 
strategies on a daily basis, in the continuity of movement action (Taylor 1989). As I will further 
develop,  crisis,  the  neoliberal  setting,  and  violence  present  a  challenge  to  which  FSs  elaborate 
contentious politics, by means of affects. While political process theory would argue about political 
opportunities and rational actors, I am here taking into account also the potential of affects to increase 
the capacity for collective action. 
 
Feminist Economies 
In the context of crisis, the FSs' criticism to the economic and model of production is even sharper. 
If the occupation and re-appropriation of political spaces represented a reaction to the lack of spaces 
and services in the urban context, to gentrification, to social segregation, this reaction is also oriented 
towards  the  economic  model  that  produces  a  certain  idea  of  the  city,  a  certain  distribution  of 
resources, a certain idea of value and well-being. In this sense, the economic model is also a symbolic 
model that gives meaning and value to the social world and its actors. What forms does the critique 
to the economic and symbolic model take from a feminist perspective?  
The management of physical spaces makes it possible to locate (in time and space) alternative models 
of consumption, circulation of money and value, and production of value. It is no coincidence that 
the institutional attacks on the FSs and the threat of eviction were justified by the evaluation of these 
spaces as unproductive, illegal, and dysfunctional with respect to the dynamics of city government. 
Non-productivity, in the neoliberal sense, means failure to fulfil a role in the capitalist production 
cycle. As an economic and symbolic model, neoliberalism also shapes the institutional set-up, its 
orientations. Institutions, too, are evaluated in terms of what they produce and their capacity for profit 
in the capitalist economic and symbolic market (Dardot e Laval 2014). FSs are not spaces of profit 
and in most cases do not produce the value required by the economic model. Since 2010, Italy's  
ISTAT has promoted an annual report on fair and sustainable well-being. The report stemmed from 
the idea that GDP (gross domestic product) was an insufficient measure for understanding the well-
being of the population. Therefore, 12 indicators were developed to expand the concept of well-being, 
such  as  health,  education,  life-time  balance,  subjective  well-being,  social  relations,  quality  of 

112 
 
services, environment, and so on. There is no doubt that new considerations are emerging, including 
from institutions and civil society, on the structural shortcomings of an economic model that produces 
social inequalities, accumulation of wealth and growth of poverty, and social malaise. FSs are part of 
this rethinking process, and they put forward alternative proposals on the subject of welfare and social 
value. These proposals, as this section will explore, differ in ideology, framing, and repertoires of 
action,  but  they  contribute  to  a  process  that,  from  a  feminist  perspective,  is  oriented  towards 
questioning and transforming the economic and symbolic model.  
The economic model is not neutral, but it is also a gender model. The creation of alternative models 
by FSs is therefore inspired by a gendered reading of the system of production and how profit is 
always  built  on  a  given  gender  division  in  labour  and  value  production.  As  a  CID  interviewee 
explains, the reaction of the FSs reveals the non-neutrality of the domain system: “I would see them 
[FSs] as places where there is access to an alternative thought to the universal and neutral one, which 
is not neutral at all. But which is the dominant one” (IR2, CID, 70). As an activists stated during the 
fieldwork, talking about her experience in Rojava, “one of the strongest messages that I brought back 
when I crossed that border from Turkey to Syria to enter Kobane, is when the first question of a 
Kurdish comrades was ‘what are you doing for women's freedom?’ [...]. And I answered ‘Lucha y 
Siesta.’ I mean I'm resisting, I'm struggling and I'm doing it by taking back a space” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 
15-06-19). This notion of resistance is embedded in a gendered interpretation of the neoliberal system. 
Thus, collective action that addresses the liberation of women also challenges the economic model, 
the management of urban space, and governance.  
The process of collectively designing life and spaces is a concrete way out of individualism and 
loneliness, which are consequences of neoliberalism (Leccardi 2009). Collective action challenges 
the linear understanding of life trajectory – birth, growth, work, marriage, child rearing – and the 
conventional understanding of urban life and public/private domains. By drawing on my fieldnotes: 
living in community among women allows participants to feel good. Not only in relation to the 
situation of violence and the outflow, but also in daily life, in household chores, in the division of 
tasks,  in  emotional  management,  in  solidarity.  This  is  very  much  at  odds  with  the  kind  of 
individualism on which we are led to think we should live (one's own home, one's own individual 
autonomy, etc.). LYS shows how community ties are often the most desirable for women, beyond 
family and marriage (Fieldnotes, LYS, 04-05-19). While contemporary societies are based on the 
nuclear family and the self-made man, FSs show how community places are necessary for the well-
being and development of a person's life. Compared to isolation and the consequences of existential 
precariousness (Butler 2016), these spaces try to experience a life in common with other rhythms and 
other economies than the neoliberal ones. 

113 
 
What alternative models do FSs develop and how do they differ from other forms of collective action? 
How are they influenced by the structure? Are such models able to produce even minimal structural 
changes? 
 
Feminist Counter-institutions  
Sociological institutionalism (SI) reflects on the way in which those complex systems that we call 
institutions produce meanings for individuals (Schmidt 2010). As Taylor and Zald (2010: 305) argue, 
institutions are “a complex of roles, norms, and practices that form around some object, some realm 
of behavior in a society.” Institutions prompt cultural norms (Peters 1999) and they operate through 
rituals  (Meyer  and  Rowan  1977).  Actors  tend  to adhere  to  models  and  routines  proposed  by 
institutions since they take them for granted according to “the logic of appropriateness” (March and 
Olsen 1998). Mackay, Monroe and Waylen (2009) argue about the potential of bridging a feminist 
analysis to sociological institutionalism as a way to “systematically identify and track the norms as 
well as the symbolic and cultural factors that play an important role in gendering institutions and their 
practices” (254). According to this view, institutions appear to be shaped by norms and values, and 
thus by a specific gender regime. The political elaboration of feminist movements has often targeted 
institutions  in  relation  to  both  legislative  changes  and  the  management  practices  of  public  life, 
welfare, services, and cultural production. Feminist reflection has concerned the aspect of norms and 
values on the one hand, and spaces on the other. As Tola argues, the feminist perspective has helped 
to rethink space (public and private) in the light of breaking down the dichotomies of private/public, 
nature/culture, rational/emotional:  
the oikos, once a mere site of containment, is thus turned into a space of autonomy from the 
patriarchal order of the polis and, perhaps, a place for cultivating an alternative politics of the 
living. The politics of the common that I am interested in arises precisely from this space of refusal 
of  what  constitutes  the  good  life  in  the  tradition  of  Western  political  thought.  Cavarero’s 
“conceptual pickpocketing” of Greek myth is part of a rich feminist genealogy that dares to think 
together  mind  and  bodies,  concepts  and  matter,  nature  and  politics.  This  is  less  an  act  of 
reparation—feminists pictured as the better half of men stitching back together that which has 
been separated—than it is an act of affirmation pointing toward modes of living otherwise” (Tola 
2016: 24-25).  
 
The affirmation of other ways of living has gone through behaviours, relational styles, social norms, 
but it has also involved the construction of structures that would last over time. These structures are 
feminist spaces, bookshops, libraries, services, places of political elaboration, archives that can be 
explored  as  counter-institutions.  In  this  sense,  FSs  will  be  analysed  as  counter-institutions  that 
sediment new codes, norms, values. The production of knowledge, values and styles of interaction 
was  followed  by  an  attempt  to  sediment  these  processes  in  concrete  places,  through  counter-
institutions able to function as interlocutors of mainstream institutions, trying to produce changes in 

114 
 
favour of social change. The continuity and depth of the work of feminist spaces has allowed them to 
be  accredited  as  alternative  models  which,  even  where  less  visible,  interact  with  institutions  by 
proposing a new set of methodologies, procedures, and values. These alternative models represent a 
lens  to  understand  the  relationship  between  agency  and  structure,  from  the  perspective  of  FSs. 
Institutions are in fact a fundamental part of the structure with which FSs are confronted, and the 
elaboration  of  alternative  models  of  institution  is  an  expression  of  their  potential  for  agency. 
According to what this research asserts, the production of alternative models of institution is the result 
of affect work, and exploring it allows us to gather new information about how affect work itself 
works. 
 
Dealing with Players 
In the attempt to engage with strategic interactionism in social movement studies, Duyvendak and 
Jasper  (2015)  elaborated  on  the  concepts  of  players  and  arenas.  The  focus  of  my  research  are 
“compound  players,”  that  means  formal  organisations:  feminist  spaces.  These  groups  engage  in 
strategic action with the goal of dismantling gender-based violence and social inequalities and of 
opening rooms for social change for disempowered people, such as women, lesbians, trans, and non-
binary people. Depending on their goals, FSs interact with different players. They deal with the 
districts and the town hall to negotiate their legal status; or with social services, in cases they run anti-
violence services that accompany women in their pathways out of gender-based violence; or they 
relate to the feminist movement to define claims, practices, and political priorities. As Duyvendak 
and Jasper claim, “players have a variety of capacities at their disposal in pursuing their goals” (2015: 
11). By reflecting on these capacities, the author tries to go beyond the concept of power, which is 
often  too  vague  or  overloaded.  He  defines  three  mechanisms  through  which  compound  players 
interact with different players and arenas: by paying, coercing or persuading them. In this dissertation, 
I argue about the way affects increase the capacity for collective action, to pursue their goals and to 
mobilise. I will use the term capacity, or potential, instead of power, to avoid the risk Jasper accounted 
for, and to report the idea of a process where meanings, tools, and competences are developed in the 
interactions with the others.   
In this section, I will look at players that FSs interact with. Firstly, I will explore the local, the national, 
and  the  international  level.  At  these  levels,  several  players  interact  with  FSs:  individuals;  the 
neighbourhood; the city; institutions; administrations; groups and associations. Secondly, I will refer 
to the relation with the feminist movement and other movements in terms of interactions, alliances 
and ruptures.  
 

115 
 
The chapter aims at contributing to the understanding of the mechanisms linking structure and agency 
to political opportunities, and to a deeper comprehension – informed by affects – of the potential for 
collective  action.  Through  the  lens  of  affects,  I  will  try  to  broaden  rational  and  structuralist 
explanation of social movements, by looking at those relational dimensions that drive the capacity 
for collective action.  
 
 
5.2 Dealing with Structure: Agency, Strategies and Constraints 
 
 
5.2.1 Facing the Crisis: A Plural Dimension 
 
All the FSs included in the research are currently dealing with a crisis. With regard to Italy, all of 
them are born as occupations, and at the time of the fieldwork they were facing attacks because of 
their legal status. However, the concept of crisis is much more extended. I will here address the crisis 
as a structure with which FSs interact, by negotiating agency, meanings and goals.  
According to the etymology of the Greek term, “crisis” refers to a moment of discernment, where a 
momentum for change discloses. Later uses of the term turned to a negative understanding, while 
crisis allows for plural meanings.  
Recently, the crisis has become the name for this historical phase. As a consequence of the economic 
crisis in 2008, social movements have been facing new challenges and constraints (Smith and Wiest 
2012, Giugni and Grasso 2016, della Porta and Pavan 2018, Bosi and Zamponi 2018, della Porta 
2020). A whole set of literature underlined the potential for an innovative repertoire of action and 
identity transitions. Carroll (2010) argues for the creation of a counter-hegemonic bloc of social 
movements in times of crisis, according to a Gramscian analysis of the economic and social context. 
He describes these times as a breakthrough for social movements that are “bringing the new into 
existence” (2010: 169).  
Together with the financial crisis, another factor came into play: the pandemic crisis. Starting from 
the beginning of 2020, the spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 radically overturned the flow of life 
(della  Porta  2020).  Several  periods  of  lockdown  heavily  impacted  on  FSs.  Because  of  social 
distancing and the lockdown, FS were forced to close or change their activities. Some of them, such 
as those that engage with DSA, continued their activities through constraints and emotional burden. 
The most difficult task was to keep the sense of community existing. The consequences on well-being 
and mental health are enduring. Because everyone was considered a danger to each other, meetings 

116 
 
and public initiatives were shut down for a long period. The fieldwork in Italy was almost over during 
the pandemic, but the latter heavily impacted the fieldwork in Spain.  
The pandemic has also made the environmental crisis, land consumption, exploitation of natural 
resources, and the incompatibility of the current system of production with the survival of humanity 
and ecosystems all the more evident. 
When we speak about crisis with regard to FSs, we refer to at least the political, economic, and 
pandemic crisis. Thus, crisis is a structural condition that shapes political opportunities. As one CS 
interviewee explains, there is a close link between the attacks on FSs, the reactionary shift in the 
management of urban space, and the economic model: 
We are in a political phase of very strong attack on our way of life and our freedom. Gradually 
over the years the State has taken everything from us. It has taken away all our room for action, 
in an increasingly violent way. And it has done it not only by eviction and by making it impossible 
to occupy, [...] but it has done it through the emptying of the streets, the emptying of the squares, 
the  repression  of  sociality  not  based  on  consumption,  the  fight  against  decay,  the  fights  for 
decency,  the  fight  against  poverty,  against  marginality,  [...]  commodification,  gentrification. 
(IIIR10, CS, 30) 
 
The attack is interpreted as a more general crisis of the production model, of social relations, of urban 
space, of the environment. The threat of eviction is just one of many steps in a process that has seen 
the consequences of the neoliberal economic model exacerbated. As the interviewee continues to 
explain, “the evictions of our physical spaces are one piece of a larger puzzle of the destruction of 
our existence” (IIIR10, CS, 30). Haraway suggests that we are dealing with “the trouble” of surviving 
on an infected planet (2016), in reference to a general crisis condition that includes land exploitation, 
resource extraction, the spread of viruses, risks to the survival of the Earth and species.  
How does the work on affects intensify in times of crisis? What effects does the crisis have on FSs, 
and what strategies do they develop? Do FSs’ strategies and repertoire of action produce structural 
changes in times of crisis? 
Just above  I  went  through  the  ancient  Greek  understanding  of  politics  and  the  city.  The  most 
frightening occurrence for the Greeks was the rupture of balance and harmony. Crisis intervenes as 
the rupture of a certain order and the transformation into a different one. An extended literature agrees 
on  the  role  of  crisis  as  an  “heterogeneous  range  of  phenomena,  [that]  testifies  of  the  need  to 
distinguish (also in the analysis of contentious politics) between times of continuity and times of 
change, normal times and intense times” (della Porta 2018: 558).  
What do crises do to FSs? As an interviewee of CID explains, the threat of eviction because of the 
amount of debt accumulated with the Municipality of Rome “broke a status quo. An equilibrium. At 
that point, the House had to open up to make appeals, ask for funds, support, political battles. And 
this has put it back into a wider, more open circuit. The House is certainly much more open now than 

117 
 
it was before the attack” (IR7, CID, 69). The crisis opens a rupture into established balances and it 
discloses the possibility to dislodge older patterns which are no longer considered effective (Collier 
and Collier 1991). On one hand, the crisis allows to change patterns that are no longer working. On 
the other, it dramatically lashes bodies and communities, and it requires innovative tools to survive. 
In  this  paragraph,  I  will  try  to  go  through  the  way  in  which  the  production  of  FSs  allows  for 
developing different strategies in times of crisis, by increasing the potential, and the trouble, for 
political action. 
FSs deeply change through crisis: they have to rediscuss their positionality, their aims, their focus, 
their networks, their strategies. While before the crisis a certain closure could work, in times of crisis 
FSs need to open as much as possible. They have to improve their openness toward the outside, to 
work with other FSs, and to elaborate credible actions with respect to their surroundings, to the 
institutions,  and  to  other  movements.  During  crises,  FSs  are  forced  to  face,  more  than  ever,  the 
materiality of life. Issues such as access to electricity and water, and their economic survival become 
salient. Economic concerns can narrow down the capacity for action, if they are not balanced with a 
clear political view and direction. Economic needs sometimes crush the political project, crushing the 
energies of the participants on finding resources, funds, and money. 
The first strategic choice of FSs is to take their own time. While usually social movements, in case 
of eviction and repression, heavily elaborate on contentious politics, FSs are primarily concerned by 
the capacity of participants to deal with the issue, and their willingness to create other types of 
resistance. The choice to deal with time and temporalities in a different way, as I will further develop 
in chapter 6, is part of the FSs’ work to preserve the participants’ positive affects, in spite of the risk 
of  emotional  burden.  FSs  construct  political  processes  by  collectively  reflecting  on  how  social 
structures are embedded in the way we feel, perceive, and react. This cultural and social incorporation 
has a bodily and cognitive effect, and it reverberates in the way we experience affects and emotions, 
and take them on board. The emotional sphere, like the corporeal one, is normally relegated to an 
instinctive, irrational, non-political function. Instead, in FSs, affects become the subject of a common 
work that allows us to understand which social structures produce certain affects, but also, starting 
from awareness, what use can be made of them. By disentangling normative temporalities, FSs reflect 
upon a political agenda consistent with the structure of feelings they aim to preserve. In this sense, 
challenging the temporality imposed by the crisis – an accelerated, ephemeral temporality, steeped in 
fear and precariousness – means proposing a new affective structure, that questions the foundations 
not only of a certain temporal model, but also of a – economic and symbolic – system of production. 
As an interviewee of LYS argues about the auctioning of the building (that is also a women’s shelter):  

118 
 
Do I have to get out of this place? I give myself my own time to get out. A) to find a solution for 
the women who live here, because it's not fair that these women live months of precariousness 
and anxiety as we are doing, and it's even less fair on their skin, B) to find an alternative solution. 
(IIR7, LYS, 35) 
 
Taking one's time means freeing up a cognitive, bodily, and relational space to elaborate positive 
affections, capable of generating innovation and not only of reacting to the context of crisis. Indeed, 
the  temporality  of  crisis  produces  feelings  of  failure  and  frustration.  Dealing  with  the  threat  of 
eviction is tiring, and it leads to disillusion. It makes participants more cautious and frightened, as an 
interviewee of LYS reports: “you come to terms with reality more. You think twice more before you 
do anything” (IIR8, LYS, 30). During crises, time becomes a constraint, because crises accelerate 
what FSs are expected to do, and participants are progressively overwhelmed by the task. Though, 
feminist communities face frustration and disillusion by putting participants’ emotions, in this case 
potential negative emotions, at the core of FSs strategies of resistance. The balance between the 
urgency to react and the preservation of the mental and physical well-being of participants requires a 
path through affections and the ability to displace limits into potentials. As a LYS interviewee further 
explains:  
I believe that it is the greatest loss that we can suffer, hating each other, not wanting to meet again 
as a collective. Beyond losing these walls, which are beautiful, cool, after that our lives are not 
worthwhile. [...] In a mixed movement they would tell you that you are a traitor [...]. We can't say 
that here. [...] Because then it happens that those who hold on have the strongest nerves. And the 
others? You lost them along the way. (IIR7, LYS, 35) 
 
FSs engage with resistance on a feminist basis, as a field of agency where options are not given, but 
they are created as long as no one is left behind. They prefer to go slow, but to keep the community 
together. Crises are moments in which vulnerability can be dealt with and encompassed in politics.  
According to this standpoint, FSs engage with networking. Moments of crisis make alliances more 
needed. The creation of a structure of feelings increases the FSs’ potential for communication. Both 
LYS and the CID’s risk of eviction has been curbed by a huge popular wave of citizens’ indignation. 
With regard to CID crisis, an interviewee says: “we had such a strong collective reaction that we 
clearly represent something beyond ourselves. People who have never come before are coming today 
to say ‘the House is not to be touched’. It must mean something” (IR5, CID, 73). These networks are 
built upon the symbolic relevance of FSs and their history. To broaden alliances and to increase 
stakeholders, FSs have to be understandable. The most immediate understanding is that which travels 
through emotional recognition, instinct, body tension. Thus, language and narratives come to the 
foreground. As an interviewee states, “we had more moments to reflect on this place than at the 
beginning, for example, even simply to have to narrate it... [...] About what this place is, what it is for 
us, what we want it to be, what works and what doesn't... so it gave us more reasons to elaborate than 

119 
 
the project itself” (IIR8, LYS, 30). Through the stimulation of affection – of indignation, love, and 
solidarity – FSs consolidate and expand their network. The network's reaction is first and foremost 
instinctive, born of affection, and travelling on a sense of communion with the FSs' cause rooted in 
emotion. The instinctive affective reaction, together with the FSs' political use of this collective 
emotion, becomes a tactic for dealing with unfavourable conditions. The crisis is an opportunity to 
put the structure of feelings to the test of contamination with new stakeholders and new alliances. In 
this hybridisation, in which the boundaries of the internal community become porous, FSs bet that 
they can expand their creativity and imagination.  
Differently than public protests and ephemeral collective action, FSs are concerned with the issue of 
continuity. FSs elaborate political processes over long periods of time. They are physical spaces and 
their projects and activities are planned over this availability of space and time. This spatial feature 
comes to be a purposive commitment to the citizenship and the city. FSs aim to be a reliable place 
were women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people in search for help or recovery can find a shelter 
despite the crises FSs are dealing with. The feelings of reliability and responsibility orient the FSs’ 
strategies. Their goals, tactics, repertoire of action, and counterparts are from time to time addressed 
consistently  with  that.  For  this  reason,  FSs  are  inclined  to  develop  strategic  alliances  with 
neighbourhood  associations,  social  workers,  lawyers,  and  institutional  representatives.  These 
alliances arise from a strategic need, but are based on an affective sharing of the purpose and function 
of the spaces. For example, with reference to the institutional figures, they are involved in the process 
of knowledge of the affective structure built by the  FSs.  This  model  becomes  an  opportunity  to 
move, through the relational channel, the protocols of the municipalities, the intervention practices 
of  the  social  services,  the  methodology  of  the  fight  against  gendered  violence,  and  the  laws  on 
common goods. These shifts represent small but significant structural changes that, starting from an 
affective management of crises, open up the possibility of innovative solutions.  
At the time of the fieldwork, the FSs under consideration were facing a series of crises. First of all, 
the economic crisis that in the last 14 years has changed welfare, the job market, the right to housing, 
the spread of gender-based violence, the endemic lack of public services, and healthcare. In this 
context, the spaces are also born as a challenge to the neoliberal economic model, which cyclically 
produces phases of crisis that expose the limits, vulnerabilities, and flaws of the entire system. In 
contrast to an economic model oriented towards the exploitation of labour, incessant productivity, the 
devastation  of  territories,  and  the  constant  extraction  of  value  (from  labour  power,  affections, 
subjectivity), the FSs tried to experiment with an alternative, physically located, in which to challenge 
the model and invent new forms of symbolic, economic, and value production. This alternative model 
is never completely external to the economic model, nor is it endowed with indiscriminate agency, 

120 
 
though through innovative strategies it is sometimes able (as in the case of work on affects) to produce 
subtle shifts in structure. The economic crisis was compounded by the threat of eviction for all, and 
thus it was also a political crisis. The threat of eviction came in various forms: as eviction of illegal 
occupations, eviction due to the accumulation of a debt to the Treasury, as an auctioning of the 
property. In all cases, however, it meant the FSs had to defend themselves from institutional attacks. 
With respect to both crises, the FSs planned their strategies in the sense of an alternative economic, 
social, political, and emotional model. Crises, as critical junctures, allowed for the elaboration of 
innovation.  By  opening  up  their  structures  of  feelings,  these  spaces  build  alliances,  enrich  the 
narrative of their political project, and break the boundaries of the “bubble” that surrounds them. 
Working on affects enables them to increase their capacity for action, in terms of strategic vision, for 
example with respect to reaction time and community preservation. As well as the potential of affect, 
crises  disclose its  limits.  The  prolonged  situation  of  crises  stimulates  negative  passions,  such  as 
fatigue, frustration, and disillusionment. These feelings alienate people and undermine the political 
project. The balance between the affections that make up the structure of the FSs' feelings determines 
their  greater  or  lesser  effectiveness  in  interacting  with  the  structure.  This  research  explores  the 
alternative models produced by FSs to cope with economic and institutional structure. Alternative 
models represent the exploration of a materialist feminism that connects the analysis of gender as a 
factor in the organisation and segregation of the social world to the economic structures that produce 
or consolidate it. Alternative models allow us to understand how FSs' agency is expressed in relation 
to  structure,  how  structure  constrains  FSs'  forms,  and  how  movement  action  can  produce  small 
structural  changes.  For  this  reason,  the  next  sections  will  investigate  the  creation  of  bottom-up 
feminist economies and feminist institutions.  
 
 
5.2.2 Feminist Economies  
 
In this section, I will look at the alternative model of feminist economies where systems of exchange 
and circulation of money/value are created. By referring to the three cases under investigation, I will 
outline institutional feminist economy; innovative feminist economy; and radical feminist economy. 
As mentioned in the introduction, the challenge to the economic and symbolic model is played out, 
on the one hand, on the idea of value, and on the other on that of well-being. What produces value 
and what is well-being? What alternatives are there, from a feminist perspective? How much does 
structure condition collective action, and how is the agency of the FSs able to produce change? 
FSs seek to produce alternative spaces to the economic model and the market logic. However, they 

121 
 
have  to  face  the  neoliberal  economic  model.  The  issue  of  counter  economies  concerns  multiple 
dimensions. First, it regards the management of a physical space that is located in a city, and in an 
institutional and administrative setting. Spaces have to face economic sustainability and, depending 
on their status – occupation, self-management, rented space – a sum of money has to be paid in order 
to keep the space existing. Money may be required to pay the rent, to renovate the space, to pay the 
people working there, to face utilities and costs. Sustainability pertains economics and people. The 
creation of alternative economies allows spaces to develop priorities, in which the well-being of 
participants comes first. Well-being comes from social relations, decent work, quality of services, 
health (in all its dimensions), economic autonomy, self-awareness and personal growth, care for 
oneself and for other people. Attention to a broader form of well-being makes it possible to change 
the social function of places such as FSs from producing profit to producing social value. Affects are 
at the heart of political action. Well-being, happiness, and positive passions are considered the main 
goals, and the circulation of money, work, services, and relational dynamics are elaborated according 
to this priority. The work on affects modifies strategies, forms of collective action, agency. 
Three directions may be labelled: an almost company-like approach; a hybrid disposition between 
reasonable profit and counter economy; a radical rejection of profit and self-income.  
The first model, that I address as institutional feminist economy, concerns those spaces that closely 
relate to institutions. Depending on this relation, they are forced to deal with a rent, a debt, a proper 
economic management of the space. Despite a blurred approach to compensation and income, they 
are willing to pay some people in order to work at the space, because of the formalisation of some 
activities (such as the restaurant and bar, the hostel, the reception desk, and so on). As one of the 
participants explains, a major shift was the change from employment and private association: “the 
other big step was from association to association of social promotion, because otherwise you can't 
participate in certain calls for proposals. Later we became a private law body, so we have private 
legal personality” (Fieldnotes, CID, 19-11-18). This transformation changes the inner structure of the 
space, forcing to face legal and economic tasks, that are close to market logics. Sometimes, the 
struggle to glean the expected amount of money blurs the political endeavour of the space. Retrieving 
from  my  fieldnotes,  during  a  conversation  with  an  activist  of  the  House:  “another  of  the  great 
problems of the House is that by virtue of economic sustainability everything is paid for, and often 
this stretch is unquestionable, making space inaccessible to many. She tells me that this is one of the 
strongest elements that drives women away, because if you can't pay here you won't find space.” 
(Fieldnotes, CID, 07-11-18). This drift makes it extremely clear how neoliberal settings keep on 
weighing  on  FSs,  conditioning  their  political  action,  despite  the  effort  to  dismiss  some of  these 
mechanisms. The more FSs depend on their relationship with institutions and its logics without an 

122 
 
adequate relationship of strength, the more they are crushed by the weight of the structure, the less 
agency they are able to express. 
A second model, that I address as innovative feminist economy, shows a hybrid nature. Some spaces 
try to work for economic autonomy, and so creating internal structures of money circulation and 
money management. As a general frame, these spaces aim at offering services, events and courses at 
popular prices. In the case of LYS, women living at the space are invited to contribute to a common 
fund, giving a small quote and so taking part in the common expenses – such as toilet paper, soaps, 
and so on (even though they do not pay rent and they can be exempted from giving their quote when 
they are out of money). As I remarked during the fieldwork and reported earlier in the fieldnotes: “the 
question of money is very sensitive because I understand that most of them, perhaps all of them, are 
very poor and every euro is important.” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 19-09-19). Often, spaces offer a practical 
answer to women living processes of pauperisation and lack of minimal requirements to survive. One 
of them comments her entrance at Lucha thus: “I couldn't do this at home, I couldn't live in a decent 
way, not in luxury, in a decent way” (IIR8, LYS, 66). Despite their inner precariousness (as squatted 
or temporary granted spaces), spaces are considered as stable and safe also for who is living a moment 
of extreme precariousness and pauperisation: “This place is also beautiful because you go out through 
the gate and you have the underground. [...] If I find myself in a moment where I've left home, I don't 
have a job, I don't have a house, well maybe the underground is handy for me. Instead of living where 
even  buses  don't  pass”  (IIR1,  LYS,  37).  This  contribution  makes  explicit  the  link  between  the 
perception of security and the material dimension of life: the possibility of living in spaces where 
financial resources do not preclude the possibility of social interaction fuels the feeling of well-being 
and, in their words, of security. 
Some tasks, such as cooking for initiatives, or reception, are remunerated. However, this is far from 
a solved issue, as this retrieved segment shows: “the case stems from the fact that someone used the 
word ‘exploitation’ to describe the commitment they put into cooking for LYS initiatives and the low 
remuneration. Laura points out that they can't talk about exploitation when all of them have a roof 
over their heads, they don't pay rent or anything and the house still has so many expenses to bear for 
the good of all. Women compare themselves in different ways: some, like Sica, say that any gain is 
fine, especially because she is willing to do something for the good of all. Slowly the others intervene, 
saying that for them the point is to help LYS too, and that maybe they can and must find a different 
way to share the earnings among the women who cook” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 04-07-19). Whenever 
money  is  part  of  the  collective  action,  troubles  emerge.  The  symbolic  significance  of  money  is 
inextricable from the neoliberal context in which its use takes place, even in places that defy the rules 
of the game. The management of money is always questioned, so that they collectively invest in a 

123 
 
large  project  of  popular  shareholdings,  which  is  still  a  debated  option.  They  develop  a  creative 
repertoire of action in terms of feminist economy, beyond the – quite typical fear – of engaging with 
money in social movements organisations. In order to implement their activities, these spaces try to 
resort to public calls (and public finances), and not simply self-financing themselves with events or 
fundraisings.  
Regarding  the  third  model,  that  I  address  as  radical  feminist  economy,  in  accordance  with  a 
longstanding history of squats, anarchist occupation, and women’s separated spaces, some spaces 
reject any type of relation with the economic market. In open contrast with the economic model where 
everything is monetised or has to make a profit, one of the CS respondents explains that: “we decided 
that [...] money didn't count for the accessibility of the place. [...] Then I wonder how much we have 
entered into a work mentality where in any place you do that activity you feel that it is your job and 
you feel that you have to be paid a lot. And you don't feel that you can do something just for the 
others” (IIIR3, CS, 30). As the quote shows, this approach radically challenges the economic model, 
by claiming the possibility to offer one's time and skills for others without being mediated by the 
exchange of money. They tend to not disdain forms of reappropriation, they seek to survive with as 
little as possible, and they define their militant choice as a purely political choice, and never as “a 
job” – so excluding the possibility to be paid for some skills and tasks. As one of the interviewees 
makes clear, in order to avoid any form of compromise with the neoliberal economic model, all forms 
of profit are excluded: “it is a space where no profit is made. [...] We have often talked about self-
income and always decided against it” (IIIR7, CS, 30). Moreover, they report the choice never to 
charge the subscription within the space, as one of the interviewees explains, in the sense of a further 
way  to  escape  from  the  model  and  rethink  the  accessibility  of  spaces  not  based  on  individual 
economic availability: “making everything fully accessible, fully passable, making a totally vegan 
choice. These are all strong, radical political choices and we have paid for [...] but we have never 
questioned it.” (IIIR10, CS, 30). According to this choice, they rarely or never compete in order to 
gain public finances, developing only self-financing types of activities.  
Despite  their  differences,  these  three  models  represent  an  alternative  to  the  neoliberal  economic 
model, and show the agency of FSs with regard to the economic, social, and symbolic structure. The 
management practices of money, work, services, profit, are oriented towards the well-being of the 
participants and the people living in the spaces.  
Well-being is an often non-existent measure in the cost-benefit calculation of the neoliberal economic 
model,  which  has  only  recently  emerged  as  a  significant  dimension  in  the  social  health  of  the 
population. What produces value is working on affects and emotions that help people to develop 
themselves beyond the subjective dimension required by the economic model, which is rational, 

124 
 
productive, and result-oriented. The development of emotional and affective competences improves 
the life of participants, and in this sense is productive of a value not accounted for by the economic 
system. The feminist perspective challenges the rational subject and the logic of profit by bringing 
back the self, affects, and emotions as a field of potential social value. Subjects are not independent 
and driven only by the increase of individual profit, but are human beings with needs, illnesses, 
emotions, desires, frustrations, limits. Subjects are always interdependent, and the quality of this 
interdependence produces social value.  
Absent its gendered function, care becomes a relational practice that allows to increase collective 
well-being. In this sense, FSs are spaces of care and well-being that rethink the economic model. The 
alternative economies of the FSs break down the dichotomy between productive/reproductive work, 
nature/culture, rational/emotional, to propose new models of well-being, value production, and social 
justice in urban contexts. Are such alternative economies able to produce structural changes, and how 
are they affected by the structure? As shown in the section, a total withdrawal from the economic 
model is not feasible, and each FSs is more or less forced to negotiate its practices and meanings with 
the structure (even if only with respect to basic needs, such as the cost of utilities). At the same time, 
the implementation of alternative models shows the limits of the economic system by developing 
some alternatives. The institutional attack against spaces is caused by the non-recognition of this 
different mode of production of social value, but also by the fear of the example that alternatives 
bring about.  
Although  apparently  minor,  some  shifts  in  the  structure  are  visible  with  respect  to  a  series  of 
alternatives proposed by the FSs, such as in the role of care (in the news during the pandemic); in 
health as a concept encompassing all the bodily, cognitive, and emotional spheres of the subjects; in 
the transformation of gender models and the distribution of the roles of social reproduction; in the 
problematisation of profit systems and labour conditions; in the methodology in combating gender-
based violence. Although sometimes difficult to trace, and influenced by various aggregate factors, 
these shifts in structure are also the result of the agency of FSs.   
 
 
5.2.3 Counter-institutions from Below  
 
The chapter explores the relation between the structure and the agency of FSs. In the previous section, 
I tried to look at the creation of alternative economies pursued by FSs with regard to the economic 
structure, and how these alternative models are affected by the structure and/or affect it. Together 
with the economic system, FSs have to deal with norms, values, and institutions. The analysis of FSs 
as  counter-institutions  allows  to  explore  how  agency  is  displayed  with  regard  to  these  other 

125 
 
dimensions. To understand FSs as counter-institutions, I will look at the meanings embedded in the 
definition of institution from a feminist perspective. In the current gender regime, the creation of 
gendered political spaces allows for debunking some elements of the structure. Then, I will trace the 
creation of feminist direct social action, its protocols and procedures as a form of contentious politics. 
The formalisation of knowledge and methodologies produced by FSs is another form of contentious 
politics, that takes place e.g. with the creation of archives. Finally, I will explore why some of them 
refer to the notion of common goods, both with regard to the economic structure and the institutional 
one.   
Quite  frequently,  participants  to  the  research – especially  from  the  CID – refer  to  the  FS  as  an 
institution, as this quote from a CID interviewee clarifies: “because the House embodies a point of 
imagination. That is, of a place made by women, for women, that women have made for themselves. 
It is an institution of women. In the proper sense of institution, that is, something that has been 
established, constructed. That we have built ourselves. We as a gender” (IR6, CID, 67). The sentence 
may sound quite striking, however, it is consistent with the SI understanding of institutions “as formal 
and informal collections of interrelated norms, rules, and routines, understandings and frames of 
meaning  that  define  ‘appropriate’  action  and  roles  and  acceptable  behavior  of  their  members” 
(Mackay, Monroe and Waylen 2009: 256). The stress on the dimension of gender as a matter of 
organisation and day-by-day interactions is consistent with a feminist approach to SI.  
In order to describe how the CID became a counter-institution, an interviewee uses the concept of “a 
ministry of women”: “the House, such a big place almost becomes the ministry of women. [...] What 
does the House say? What does the house say? [...] That's a bad thing, to say ministry, because it's 
not producing or administering anything, but it's a place that has certainly been taken as a symbol. 
Because it does not have one voice, but it has many. Women do not have only one voice” (IR1, CID, 
58). These places are symbols of thought, rituals and codes, they have a public voice and are taken 
as a point of reference by women when they need tools to understand what they are living, what is 
happening in the contemporary world.  
Gender is a key factor in the way these relationships (between spaces and the context) are shaped. 
Italy is a national context where gender equality – even on a formal level – is far from being achieved 
(Calabrese et al. 2018). The occupations and the management of spaces by groups of women, lesbians, 
trans, and non-binary people still appears as unconventional. As a CS interviewee argues: “If there 
had been a lot of males in that place [...] the attitude would have been different. Instead, we are a 
bunch of unreadable sluts who are not even taken very seriously, so they think: OK, we'll cut off the 
light” (IIIR5, CS, 30). As the quote highlights, gender influences the relationships with institutions 
and  companies.  A  group  of  women  is  considered  less  serious,  less  skilled,  less  dangerous,  less 

126 
 
credible.  Since  femininity  is  still  built  upon  vulnerability,  women  are  deemed  as  incapable  of 
managing a physical space, its utilities and practical needs. Thus, FSs play with the boundaries of 
gender, by confusing and enlarging what women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people can do. Yet, 
they keep engaging with the consequences of institutional discrimination because of their gender. 
These spaces seek to reverse the stigma often attached to those who are still considered as deviant 
people. As a CS interviewee says: “there is a beautiful tazebao at the space, with a whole series of 
words including faggot, whore, gorda, bitch... they are not insults but they are our revolution.” (IIIR7, 
CS, 30). FSs allow people to deal with affects produced by economic and social structures which 
heavily impact their life. By elaborating on those collective affects (that are not the result of individual 
failures  but  rather  of  structural  conditions),  FSs  lay  the  groundwork  for  social  change,  as  the 
following quote of CS participant shows:  
A lot of people approached us because we were talking about violence, this is objective, because 
it was an absolutely invisible subject. [...] It is the responsibility of all those who have done 
politics over the years, of having fixed a super clear line of demarcation between the private and 
the political, and it was necessary to destroy that wall. (IIIR10, CS, 30) 
 
Violence  and  gender  thus  become  political  dimensions,  unrelated  to  the  private  sphere,  to  pure 
identity  claims,  or  access  to  civil  rights.  As  political  dimensions,  neither  the  experience  nor  the 
solution are individual, but concern on the one hand the identification of the social structures that 
reproduce them, and on the other hand the collective instruments used to transform the structure. As 
mentioned above, both malaise and well-being are elements that relate to the production of social 
value.  As  alternative  models,  FSs  do  not  build  profit-oriented  institutions,  but  welfare-oriented 
institutions, where welfare becomes a goal of social change. Interviewees underline how different 
subjectivities feel “comfortable, welcome, protected” (IIIR7, CS, 30). Through spaces of well-being 
people can understand, rest, and re-shape, and this is a process through which people change their 
life. Although small-scale revolutions are usually misread, they are the first seed of a wider process 
of social change.   
By challenging the criteria of isomorphism – that means the institutional tendency to homogeneity 
(Powell and DiMaggio 1991) – FSs counter-balance the requirement of adaptation to State norms and 
practices. They produce codes, structures, and cultural norms, often in opposition to mainstream 
paradigms  and  expectations.  As  a  CID  interviewee  shows,  while  being  a  kind  of  bottom-up 
institution, FSs recognise the principle of reciprocity, whereby anyone approaching the space is not 
only  given  something,  but  is  asked  to  contribute  to  its  continuation:  “in  my  opinion,  this  is  the 
principle that should underlie it. That is a principle of belonging. It is that you come here and you 
don't find an institution, someone who gives you something from above, or beggars you. That is an 
equal relationship of dialogue. You can belong to this place, you can be part of this place, you can 

127 
 
contribute to the improvement of this place but also to the continuation of its existence” (IR3, CID, 
45).  
The development of anti-violence centres in Italy provides an interesting case: the protocols of the 
fight  against  gender-based  violence  have  been  established  between  institutions  and  grassroot 
practices. The first centre was created in a women’s occupation in Rome (Baglioni and Zaremba 
2003), and nowadays the system of anti-violence support in Italy is mostly managed by feminist 
organisations  and  networks,  with  (little)  funding  from  public  institutions  (Demurtas,  Peroni  and 
Mauri 2021). The day-by-day practice of direct social action produces routines and codes. The set of 
skills developed through feminist direct social action (FDSA) becomes an established methodology 
that challenges institutional protocols in combating gender-based violence. As a LYS participant 
explains during a public intervention:  
These women in 11 and a half years invented practices that they were then able to teach. So the 
experience of the anti-violence service [...] meant that at some point they were able to create a 
training  course  for  anti-violence  workers.  A  place  where,  whatever  the  city  hall  and  the 
municipality say, they never listened to us, never showed up, but it is from Lucha that the social 
services and a number of institutions come, because there is really a lack. [...] Women who are 
welcomed into Lucha, with respect to entering these pathways out of violence that do not have a 
time frame, the women stay there as long as necessary, and they take part into the management 
of the feminist space. (Fieldnotes, LYS, 22-06-19) 
 
As the quote shows, three elements emerge. First, the development, through continuity, of skills, 
professionalism, and direct action that are passed on. Second, the ambiguous relationship with the 
institutions.  On  one  hand,  formal  institutions  take  advantage  of  FSs’  existence,  because  of  the 
structural lack of services, welfare, social provisions, and state care. FDSA fulfil inadequate state 
intervention  in  the  field  of  gender-based  violence,  but  also  poverty,  marginalisation,  mental  and 
physical health. In the municipality of Rome, institutions provide 30 bed accommodations in shelters 
for women escaping violence (out of the 300 which the Convention of Istanbul requires for Rome's 
population  density),  while  LYS  provides  15  of  them.  This  means  that  almost  half  of  the 
accommodations  available  are  supplied  by  FDSA.  However,  this  informal  delegation  of  social 
functions goes with constant micro techniques of exhaustion and devious attacks. Some interviewees 
describe  the  ambivalence  of  institutions  as  blindness  with  regard  to  gendered  violence.  It  is 
considered by institutions an emergency for which emergency provisions are needed, while violence 
is a structural manner that FSs address in the long-term.  
Other participants of CS explain the reason why FDSA are effective but frightening for institutions: 
this is because “in providing the service we partly activate a process of subjectivation” (IIIR6, CS, 
35). In terms of subjectivation, the third element emerges. FSs are based on the creation of structures 
of  feelings  in  which  participants  elaborate  and  transform  collective  affects  through  a  relational 

128 
 
process, by overcoming the rational/emotional and body/mind divide. FSs claim for processes of 
social change that are grounded in the acknowledgment and work on structures of feelings that people 
deal with. The breakdown of the division between rationality/emotionality represents a crack in the 
economic,  symbolic,  and  social  model.  As  a  CS  interviewee  clarifies,  these  are  spaces  “of 
subjectification, of politicisation [...] and therefore it is a space that disrupts the order (IIIR6, CS, 
35).  
Knowledge production, new methodologies and procedures risk being volatile. In the continuity of 
FSs collective action, new codes can be sedimented. The choice to formalise new codes is made, for 
example, through the transformation of a collective into an association, or the opening of a formal 
archive  of  the  history  of  the  feminist  movement.  As  a  CID  interviewee  claims,  this  choice  of 
formalisation goes in the direction of having “an institutional counterpart” (IR9, CID, 72). This is a 
contentious practice toward public institutions, that often dismiss, ignore, or disavow grassroot types 
of organisations, knowledge and methodologies. In the perception of one LYS participant, such work 
is not ephemeral, but has sedimented over time, giving rise to alternative models to institutions: “a 
whole movement of associations from below that has built, in the suburbs very often, another city. 
[...] There is a work that has effectively replaced the institutions.” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 22-06-19). The 
effectiveness of FSs’ direct action represents an interesting case of the supposed opposition between 
rational actors and affects (Gould 2004). As counter-institutions, FSs engage with the production of 
new norms, procedures, and forms of direct action. However, this strategic evaluation is always 
balanced by work on how these new codes impact participants, what feelings are at stake, and how 
these collective affects shape and transform collective action. In this sense, we cannot speak of a 
rationality completely divorced from affects, nor of a pure emotional field without compromise with 
strategic evaluation. 
In this direction lies the concept of feminist common goods. As the opposite of private property, 
common goods are spaces managed by the community. They aim at creating new democratic circuits 
that do not produce profit in the capitalist system (Bailey and Mattei 2013). FSs broaden the concept 
by bridging the role of affects and individual change as a proxy for social change. A CID interviewee 
explains the concept as follows: “it must be the place where any woman can come and find what she 
is looking for” (IR6, CID, 67). The idea of common goods is consistent with the creation of alternative 
economic  models,  as  mentioned  above.  A  CID interviewee  argues  for  this  relationship  between 
common goods and the fight against the economic model, through the creation of community and 
other forms of social value: 
Rome is a dispersed city. [...] These places represent a point of aggregation and reference. Of 
identity. It is not by chance that they want to close them down. [...] In the city they represent the 
idea that you can live in a community that is not purely market-based. The real problem is the 

129 
 
problem that places are only the antithesis of the individualist market vision. The commons. [...] 
Political in itself, alternative in itself. You say there is a possible alternative use of things. Things 
that are not just to be sold and bought. This is also the case for the House (IR6, CID, 67) 
 
In this section I explored the creation of counter-institutions pursued by FSs as a lens to understand 
the  relation  between  agency  and  structure.  Social  movements  always  interact  with  democratic 
processes  and  structures,  by  fuelling  innovation  (della  Porta  2005,  2009).  FSs  open  up  to  a 
questioning of democracy by claiming the role of affects (as in being affected by, and to affect) in 
political process. Institutions are deeply influenced by the economic model and as such are oriented 
towards productivity and profit, even if they reflect a certain idea of equity or social justice. FSs are 
physical places in which a set of norms, practices, and values settle. Thanks to the continuity of 
collective action, not only FDSAs but also counter-institutions from below and common goods come 
to life. Rather than depressing collective action, collective affects interplay with the construction of 
common methodologies, procedures, and practices. In this sense, in spite of the removal of emotions 
from the institutional structure and subjectivity to which they refer, emotions consolidate and develop 
collective action. These alternative models are in constant relation to the structure, they are influenced 
and modified by it. At the same time, precisely because of their continuity, they produce subtle 
changes in the structure. The diffusion of gender as a key element in policy, the influence of feminist 
methodologies in combating gender-based violence, the implementation of feminist knowledge in the 
academy are some of the shifts produced by the FSs' work of consolidating counter-institutions. 
 
 
5.3 Dealing with Players  
 
 
5.3.1 The Local and International Level  
 
How is the interaction with urban space, groups and associations, institutions, international actors 
shaped by FSs? And how do they influence FSs? Which goals are at stake in the interaction with 
these actors? Do FSs produce consequences on different levels, according to their goals?  
In the first part of the chapter, I began to explore the relationship between agency and structure by 
looking at two alternative models constructed by the FSs: that of feminist economies and that of 
counter-institutions. In the following sections, I will look more closely at their interactions with a 
range of players, and how they affect FSs and are affected by them.  
By relating with their surroundings, FSs elaborate on different type of strategies. First, they aim at 
producing a broader acknowledgment of gender dynamics and gender-based violence, which results 
in social change. Thus, they aim to change people’s, groups’, and institutions’ attitude toward these 

130 
 
issues.  The  change  of  everyday  life  and  behaviours  goes  with  the  change  in  norms,  values,  and 
culture.  To  understand  these  strategies,  I  will  specifically  refer  to  FSs’  interactions  with  several 
players: the locals, the urban space, associations and groups, institutions, international actors.  
“Can  I  bring  my  chair?”:  several  times,  this  question  was addressed  by  people  attending  public 
initiatives for participants of LYS. It is telling about the way locals relate to the FS: when they take 
part in the events they can “bring their chair.” In a way, it means bringing their needs, their ideas, 
their inner world. With this example retrieved from the fieldwork, I would like to engage with the 
first field of interaction between FSs and the outside: the urban space.  
In order to engage with urban space and the neighbourhood, FSs adopt two strategies. They offer 
activities and public initiatives within the FSs, and they try to change the public space of the city, by 
going  beyond  the  four  walls  of  the  FSs.  Affects  such  as  comfort  and  a  welcoming  attitude  are 
perceived by locals, who take part in the FSs’ life not as users, but as part of the social environment. 
As one of the LYS interviewees explains, the creation of a welcoming feeling structure, where well-
being is considered an emotional condition that produces social change, is perceived by people from 
outside and increases their desire to participate: “Lucha has always been open to the territory. [...] 
Not just proposals from other associations, from families who came to us and asked if they could 
have a children's party in the garden. [...] Here it was a more intimate situation, and they felt calmer. 
This gives the measure of how much this space has entered into people's everyday life” (IIR6, LYS, 
51). By working on affects and the role of communities, FSs challenge neoliberal individualism and 
the large cities’ tendency to let people think only about themselves (Castells 1984). As explained 
above, the production of alternative economies also means to recognise the role of interdependence 
and care, and to build networks around this form of interaction. In this sense, a respondent in LYS 
explains  that  “here  people  feel  that  there  is  someone  who  cares”  (IIR6,  LYS,  51).  Attention  to 
interdependence  and  care  facilitates  people’s  participation,  and  it  offers  a  possibility  of  social 
interaction outside the rules of neoliberalism. 
The more people take part in FSs, the more they get in touch with gender-based violence: direct 
relationships with women escaping violence produce a process of awareness-raising. They see, they 
feel, they listen to women that are usually invisible or only reported as victims. Through this affective 
proximity, people are more willing to support FSs and to help them with different types of resources: 
time, energy, money, clothes, food. During public assemblies in LYS, people from the neighbourhood 
take part, as when a woman states: “I come because it is accessible for me here. I live here and I come 
here because it's the only place for women, in such a big city. [...] I agree to defend this space, which 
is my space” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 27-06-19). Awareness promotes political subjectivation, which not 
necessarily becomes political participation although it evolves into forms of social change.

The relation with the urban space and the neighbourhood depends on some features. Architectural 
conditions, social compositions, services, and so on. The CID is located in a quite touristic district, 
which decreases the possibility for strong ties with locals. LYS, instead, is part of one of the bigger 
and most populated districts in Europe – Tuscolano – with branching possibilities and interactions. 
The CS is part of a gentrified neighbourhood, with universities and shops, but few community ties. 
Whatever  the  neighbourhood  is  composed  of,  public  spaces  are  often  a  source  of  ambivalent 
emotions, such as fear (Pain 1991) for women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people, both because 
of architectural dimensions and because of the production of a series of social emotions connected to 
those spaces. In order to transform these emotions (Belingardi, Bonu, Castelli and Olcuire 2020), FSs 
promote walks at night and different kinds of actions: with performative actions they aim to change 
the nature of public spaces by using their bodies and their presence. As the following quote retrieved 
from a CS interviewee shows, FSs engage with the urban space by working on collective emotions, 
such as fear and discomfort, and they elaborate on collective action, that reverses them into positive 
feelings. 
The question of walking and taking back neighbourhoods, in a historical era of security packages, 
of introducing a series of super oppressive devices on urban marginality, was a political act. [...] 
The slogan “free streets are made by the women who walk them,” came from us. [...] Our need 
was to say we don't need protectors, we stay where we want, we do what we want. And this is 
something that has contaminated the discourses of the campaigns in general, and [...] also the 
imaginary. (IIIR10, CS, 30) 
 
The sense of comfort, strength and well-being is produced out of negative affect, through collective 
action that works both on the setting and the structure of feelings. As the quotation explains, the 
creation of these new structures of feelings has the capacity to contaminate the narrative about public 
space, the imaginary, and the perception of people. In this sense, repertoires of action based on the 
use of affects increase the capacity for collective action and agency, but also the capacity to affect 
the structure. The performative action involving participants' bodies changes the nature of the space, 
as explained by a CS interviewee: “we go through them [urban spaces] and somehow just the fact 
that there is a sign, a thing, that tells you, that gives you strength, is positive” (IIIR9, CS, 35). This 
repertoire of action is also intended to map safer and unsafe places, in order to make people willing 
to change them. Thanks to this mapping, which is a political action per se, they also realise what is 
missing in terms of services and grassroot provisions, and they try to fill in.  
In their strategic interaction, FSs build upon relations with local associations and groups, in order to 
broaden their visibility and to pursue their goals. As one episode of the fieldwork shows, the FSs 
build networks with a range of subjects so that they can reach all the people looking for the right 
information. This networking activity is a strategic resource that allows them to broaden the scope of 
knowledge and participation in the space, and also its impact: “at that moment Clara enters, she says 

132 
 
that she spent the morning in an Arci club [cultural association], because they were presenting an 
interactive map that they are building with all the references that can be useful to non-Italian people. 
[...] LYS also participated in the construction and is on the map, so she was there” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 
03-07-19). As much as FSs gain visibility and participation through networking, so do groups and 
associations broaden the scope of their interests by getting in touch with FSs’ claims and struggles. 
As an episode retrieved from the fieldwork shows, associations located in other neighbourhoods 
decide to present the premiere of a show at LYS: “the first woman to speak says that it is very 
important for her to present the show for the first time at LYS, and that they have chosen it expressly 
because it is a place of women and interculturality. She says that LYS is a place of concrete utopias, 
and that it is a place of comrades, sisters and friends that must be defended and protected by all” 
(Fieldnotes,  LYS,  09-06-19).  The  structures  of  feelings  produced  by  FSs  make  groups  and 
associations curious about networking with them. As the channel of affection is very often invisible 
in cultural and political networks, it is a source of curiosity and attraction for groups and associations. 
Openness  to  contamination  with  feminist  work  on  affects  allows  them  to  experiment  with  new 
languages and new tools that often prove effective in their own field of action. 
In order to network with the outside, FSs elaborate ways to interact with institutions. In the previous 
sections, I already address the relation between FDSA and institutions, and the process through which 
FSs produce counter-institutions. Here, I will address institutions as formalised players that are part 
of the structure of governance of the regional, national, and international structure.  
Most  of  FSs  reject  the  mechanism  of  representation  and  delegation,  by  always  interacting  as 
collective actors. This attitude, and an autonomous community of women, lesbian, trans, and non-
binary people, can be disorienting, since people are quite used to hierarchies and representatives, and 
especially to male ones. Thus, FSs tackle gender dynamics embedded in the interactions among social 
movements and other actors by challenging gender norms that pre-exist the interaction. The choice 
to reject delegation in the strategic interaction with other players allows for a potential of freedom, 
innovation, but also limits.  
Feminist movements have always challenged male culture, rules, and formal organisations, such as 
institutions (Taylor and Whittier 1991). As one LYS participant made clear during a public assembly, 
FSs are born out of an awareness of the gender regime and the economic model that also shape 
institutions, their goals and strategies: “we know how much alliances and the feminist practice of 
relationships are necessary because institutions are patriarchal, because institutions are liberal, and 
they cannot look after our interests” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 22-06-19). This statement is illustrative of the 
way institutions are contested as gendered and neoliberal. Despite the narrative of universal rights at 
the  basis  of  contemporary  democracy,  institutions  keep  organising  according  to  gender  regimes 

133 
 
(Walby 2004). Male codes and norms do not only shape the representation, but also the set of rules 
and actions through which institutions work. Decision-making processes, the approval of legislation, 
the way courts function all rely on a gendered understanding of the social world (Zajicek, Calasanti 
1998,  Folbre  2015).  The  literature  on  state  feminism  analyses  the  way  women  and  feminist 
perspectives struggle to get into sectors of public institutions, because of resistant patriarchal legacies 
(Bennet 1989, Halford 1991, Rhode 1994).  
There are many ways in which FSs face unfavourable stakeholders, and one of them is to slowly 
crawl inside the apparatuses by trying to change gender paradigms through education. As a CID 
interviewee says:  
We have done more than one training course, and more than one social worker told us [with regard 
to women escaping violence that they work with]: “I can't listen to her, it bothers me” [...]. If you 
work on this you can get rid of this heritage. Basically, of these superstructures to which we all 
fall prey. (IR2, CID, 69) 
 
The decision to relate with institutions and its bodies and to “educate” them is part of a broader 
analysis on the way in which institutions shape women’s lives. Changing them is a way to change 
women’s possibility for a better life, beyond the change of values and culture. FSs do not, in fact, aim 
to replace or completely fill the gaps in the institutional system, but by producing alternative models 
they also intend to change what exists and what most people interface with. 
Despite the general consensus on this interpretation of institutions, FSs elaborate different strategic 
interactions depending on their goals, composition, and ideology. Some of them, such as the CID, 
directly interact with institutions, and they feel themselves as part of a terrain in-between the grassroot 
and the institutional. Other, such as LYS, are strategically interacting with institutions, because of the 
need to keep FDSA working. The CS rejects every type of interaction with institutions: they do not 
engage with them not even when it would strategically serve to save the shelter that they manage.  
Among  those  who  choose  to  interact  with  institutions,  some  differences  occur.  As  one  LYS 
interviewee explains, strategic interaction with institutions is the expression of a power relationship 
in which collective action is increasingly effective: 
At one of the many tables of negotiation with institutions, [...] I remember that [...] when they 
heard  [that  we  host  in  the  shelter]  12  women,  they  said:  “no  problem!  We'll  sort  them  out 
tomorrow.” There, myself, [...] I understood. There was already a passage of growth of Lucha, at 
the table. [...] My answer was: “no maybe you didn't understand. You are arranging these 12, but 
so that another 12 women can come in.” (IIR6, LYS, 51) 
 
The quote is telling about a learning process through which FS increase their capacity to negotiate. 
They  progressively  become  aware  about  their  social  function  and  the  capacity  to  transform 
procedures, values, and structures, and they “play” this awareness in the relation with institutions. 

134 
 
The  strategy  through  which  FSs  interact  with  institutions  through  a  double  presence  within  and 
without institutions is oriented to influence and to push institutions towards the approval of expected 
outcomes. As an interviewee claims about the CID’s history: “the committee of women elected by 
the  municipalities  was  born  in  the  politics  of  places  through  the  women's  pact  to  create  the 
International House of Women in Rome. And it worked. Them inside and us outside, it worked. We 
managed to have the International House of Women” (IR9, CID, 72).  
FS modulate their relations according to the type of institution, as in the case of Lazio region, where 
the municipality is very hostile to FSs while the regional government tends to collaborate, also for 
reasons of political competition with the municipality.  
The process of emptying democratic institutions of the capacity for political dialogue with citizens 
and movements also influences the FSs willing to collaborate. Sometimes, to avoid being trapped in 
an interaction that is no longer working, FSs shift to other players, such as international ones. They 
often host public events with women’s communities from other countries. The creation of strong 
transnational ties is a matter of movements but also of institutions. For some of them, the European 
Union is an actor to strategically interact with because of its attention to gender-based violence, 
gender mainstreaming and women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people’s rights.  
As the analysis shows, through the lens of interactions at the local and international level we can 
closely explore the consequences of the work on affects pursued by FSs. The use of affects in the 
interaction with players and arenas increases the potential for collective action.  
 
 
5.3.2 The Feminist Movement 
 
Movements are born, grow, then decline and die. And we are like wine. There comes a time when it is perfect, 
for a certain amount of time you can drink it. Perfect, that is, it is at its peak, its apex. Then there will surely 
be another wine better than that, but it reaches that point and then at a certain point it decreases more or less 
rapidly. (IIIR7, CS, 30) 
 
The time frame of this research goes from 2017 to 2021. In these years, in Italy and Spain, a new 
wave of the feminist movement occurred, triggered by a cycle of contention in Latin America called 
“Ni Una Menos” (Chironi 2019, Barone and Bonu forthcoming). The FSs under investigation existed 
before the new wave of mobilisation, but they are part of it and often prepared mobilisations to come. 
As Taylor explored (1989), structures of abeyance are carriers of symbols and values which are 
mobilised in the preparation of new phases of contention. FSs are structures of abeyance, but they are 
also protagonists of movements, when they emerge. How do FSs relate with contemporary feminist 

135 
 
movement? Are their repertoires of action increasing the capacity of the feminist movement? Is the 
work on affects mobilised into the movement’s action and meanings? 
The FSs taken into account have different type of approaches to Non Una di Meno (NUDM), that is 
the name of the contemporary feminist movement in Italy. Most of them were embedded in the 
network that prepared the first assemblies and mobilisations with the name NUDM. However, as long 
as the movement grew and changed, they changed their approach to it.  
The two spaces that are used to strategic interactions with institutions, as addressed in the previous 
section, the CID and LYS, carry on the same strategic choice with the movement. Despite its limits 
and contradictions, the feminist movement allows claims to emerge, and it enhances the FSs’ goals.  
The third one, the queer and transfeminist squat of CS, even though contributing to the creation of 
NUDM, later withdrew from it. They highlight the critical conditions of Rome: as a large city, it does 
not favour a genuine development of movement dynamics. Moreover, the location in the capitol city 
increases the risk of geographical inequalities, since the assembly in Rome is always more powerful 
and voiced than other minor cities in the network at the national level. Already existing political 
structures  tend  to  close  spaces  for  innovation,  and  they  reproduce  power  dynamics  within  the 
movement. By addressing the limits of NUDM, a CS interviewee argues: “It is a militant assembly. 
So it may happen that every now and then some girl, some woman who is not actively involved in 
politics comes, but it tends not to be like that. So the problem that has always existed since the 
beginning of NUDM is that it was a bit of a separate assembly of movement. With the same dynamics 
as non-separate movement assemblies” (IIIR2, CS, 37). Even other FSs highlight the risk of a militant 
composition and of professionalisation of activists, who learn a new grammar and replicate it without 
any real engagement for social and political change. As an interviewee of the CID argues: “I have 
been to NUDM, even there, there is a certain closure. And frankly I went more than once but it is a 
closed place, where there is a leadership, there are rituals, there are precise things, you who are there 
are looked at a bit like that because you are of the House” (IR7, CID, 69). FSs tend to recognise the 
internal dynamics of the movement much more clearly because of the continuity of their collective 
action. In everyday politics they interface with roles, affects, dynamics (as explored in previous 
sections), and this work represents a background with which they also participate in the movement. 
Recognising the limits but also the possibilities of the movement, as a sounding board for the FSs' 
claims, prompts FSs to make a strategic assessment of the interaction. FSs who manage services and 
DSAs are more likely to maintain a direct presence and interaction with the movement, even in 
difficulties, because of this strategic evaluation. Those more radical, in claims and actions, such as 
CS,  are  instead  more  reluctant  to  accept  a  mediation  plan  and  are  quicker  to  shy  away  from 
participation. 

136 
 
Despite the strategic choice to always maintain an interaction with movement, FSs managing DSA 
are also more attentive to recognising movement drifts. Some of them, such as LYS, contest NUDM 
as the fashion of the moment, attracting a lot of groups and movements that are not feminist at all and 
that try to get in just for the sake of visibility.  Moreover, precisely because of their commitment to 
DSA,  they  criticise  the  tendency  to  focus  on  claims  and  campaigns,  leaving  apart  the  direct 
intervention into social reality. As a LYS interviewee argues:  
Unfortunately it has become again [...] a movement of opinion... instead a feminist movement is 
made on practices. It is better that it goes slowly, better that it does little, but that it does it on 
practices. And you can't do it all. [...] That whole aesthetic stuff that mixed movements have been 
doing for years. Where you mime the alternative. But you don't practise it. You have to practise 
the alternative. Because only if you practise it will you realise where it works and where it doesn't 
work. Otherwise it's a nice idea of yours, but one that has little connection with reality. And above 
all, it must be about solidarity. But really [...] you have to confront that contradiction, which is 
having relationships with someone who is different from you. Which is exhausting. And that it 
doesn't work out the way you think. (IIR3, LYS, 43) 
 
As already mentioned, the quote contains the major elements of criticism by FSs to the contemporary 
feminist movement. Firstly, being focused on slogans and claims but having progressively lost a 
reference to practices and direct social intervention. The representation of social change, rather than 
the practice of social change, sheds light on the contrast between the eminently prefigurative character 
of FSs and the feminist movement, which is oriented towards other strategies and tactics. Secondly, 
there is also a critique of time, a time that is too rapid and dictated by the constant pursuit of the 
topical issue, the fashion of the moment, the political agenda, and less so by a feminist politics rooted 
in needs and affects. In this sense, the movement seems to be losing the elements that make FSs 
capable of maintaining the long duration of politics, namely the ability to create structures of feelings 
that participants choose to continue to inhabit. Finally, the main critique regards the lack of attention 
to FSs. Since the movement pays attention to day-by-day emergencies, it sometimes risks to leave 
aside  the  experience  of  FSs.  Because  of  that,  two  consequences  occur:  on  one  hand  that  the 
proliferation of struggles and campaigns weaken the common frame of gender-based violence as the 
structure of society; on the other hand, the progressive drop out of anti-violence centres, services, and 
FSs from the movement’s activities.  
Despite  this,  all  the  FSs  recognise  the  powerful  effect  that  NUDM  has  had  in  terms  of  cultural 
transformation and widespread influence on education and social dynamics. Notwithstanding the 
impossibility to keep the long-term work of FSs into bigger processes such as the emerging feminist 
movement,  some  elements  are  deeply  embedded.  The  repertoire  of  action  of  FSs,  focused  on 
community building process, affective ties, and the political work on emotions, is mobilised into the 
movement’s action and meanings. As a LYS interviewee points out, “we have always said: male 
violence against women is not a fucking ghetto. It is something that everyone should be interested in. 

137 
 
So you come, you confront it, you see it, you talk to it... you live it... because it affects you...” (IIR3, 
LYS, 43). This idea of politicising gender-based violence as a social phenomenon that everyone 
should care about is part of the cultural outcome of NUDM. In this sense, FSs’ efforts increase the 
capacity of the feminist movement as a whole.  
While FSs have a fluctuating type of relations with the movement, they express a fully committed 
solidarity to one another. A CS interviewee explains that in the continuity of FSs, alliances and 
networks of interdependence are built beyond ideology and differences, so that in times of crisis, such 
as the current one, FSs immediately develop common strategies: “what makes the most sense to me 
is to be there and make it clear to the closest comrades with whom we have been messing around and 
doing politics for decades that we are there if you need us, [...] because I recognise you and I support 
you. I may not agree but I will continue to support you” (IIIR7, CS, 30). Despite different views and 
ideologies, all of them share the effort to produce structures of feelings capable to affect and change 
the structure, and this effort is the ground for enduring political alliances.  
In this section I have tried to offer some insights into the relationship between feminist movements 
and FSs. Here, too, the mediation of affects as a discriminant appears clear. Feminist movements tend 
to have a more accelerated rhythm and repertoires of action, ones more oriented towards claims and 
influence in the public discourse. The time and forms of political action often do not allow, on the 
one hand, the work on affects as a basis for collective action and, on the other, the construction of 
structures of feelings. These two elements are inscribed in everyday politics and continuity, which 
are  instead  characteristic  elements  of  SFs. thanks  to  everyday  interactions  and  the  continuity  of 
collective action, SFs can elaborate the work on affects and structures of feelings. This difference 
represents a distance between spaces and movements, which is sometimes shortened by the strategic 
action of spaces, that, sensing the political opportunity of the relationship with movements, try to 
transform differences into channels of encounter.  
 
 
5.4 Agency and Structure by Means of Affect: A Summary  
 
In this section, I analysed the interaction between agency and structure, with regard to FSs. By taking 
into  account  political  process  theory  and  the  critiques  to  an  overly  rationalist  and  structuralist 
interpretation, I brought in the concept of agency and that of players and arenas, together with affect 
and relational dynamics that serve as a ground for collective action. At the macro level, I tried to 
tackle the relation between FSs and the context of the (economic, political, and health) crisis. The 
analysis allows for claiming the role of affects as the driving force in the elaboration of strategies and 
tactics with regard to these arenas, and with regard to the slight structural changes they are able to 

138 
 
produce  in  the  structure.  To  closely  understand  the  interaction  between  agency  and  structure,  I 
focused on two alternative models FSs engage with. The creation of feminist economies, based on 
women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people’s needs; and on the challenge to negative affects 
coming from pauperisation and neoliberal productivity, to let other emotions emerge, such as well-
being, willingness to participate, happiness, and joy. This structure of feelings works as a tool for 
relating with institutions and the State, both at the individual and collective level. The creation of 
counter-institutions allows FSs to elaborate on these structures of feelings, by developing strategies 
and actions to innovate democracy. The same structure of feelings works for the interaction with 
different players, such as local, national and international actors, as well as the feminist movement.  
Reflections  on  agency  and  structure,  and  on  the  relationship  with  other  actors,  highlight  the 
contestation of the neoliberal rationality (Dardot and Laval 2013) carried out by FSs. What does this 
contestation imply in practice? Undoubtedly, as the chapter argues, the creation of alternative models 
and styles of strategic interaction. However, it also implies an expanded contestation of the concept 
of value. If value, in terms of productivity, profit, competition, merit, is the yardstick by which actors 
and institutions of the social world are evaluated, FSs enact a reversal of the way value is understood. 
Value becomes social value, understood as a level of well-being, self-understanding, identification of 
needs, elaboration of effective responses to needs, elaboration of time/space consistent with collective 
affect, new circuits of production, alternative approaches to money and exchange, promotion of social 
ties as the basis for individual and community development.  
The concept of social value cannot be measured with the traditional tools of neoliberal rationality, 
yet it seems to shed light on what in this research is called the potential for action. The increase in the 
potential for action pursued in the FSs is, in fact, at the origin of the production of social value. In 
this dynamic, it is possible to find the trace of the work on affects, of the continuity of collective 
action, of the small changes produced with respect to structure. Exploring the reflection on social 
value allows us to develop an understanding of the forms of collective action, of the relationship 
between agency and structure, and of the outcomes of movements.  
Affects, emotions, and feelings are embedded in the creation of strategies and action that allow FSs 
to, on one hand, increase the capacity to relate with players and arenas, and, on the other hand, to 
develop agency with regard to the structure. These insights pertain to the macro level. How does the 
work on affects operate at the meso level?

6. Structures of Feelings 
 
 
6.1 Introduction  
 
This chapter explores the creation of feminist spaces as structures of feelings, where the work on 
collective affects and emotions is made into politics.  
The initial research question of this project asked how feminist movements imagine, produce, and 
preserve safer spaces. In order to find an answer, it was necessary to spatialise the analysis, and thus 
to look at some physical places produced by feminist groups in which certain discourses and practices 
were sedimented in the continuity of collective action. The analysis carried out through CGTM led 
me to focus on affect and emotions, and on the way in which they are brought into play in the 
collective action of FSs. The analysis of affects allows FSs to make use of them in a way that increases 
their capacity for action on an individual and collective level. The frequent reference by participants 
to the feeling of greater safety or safer spaces is thus a consequence of a broader and deeper process 
that concerns the roots of collective action, and the assumptions on which collective action is built. 
It is precisely in the use of affects and the contestation of the rational, disembodied, and productive 
subject,  typical  of  the  neoliberal  economic  model,  that  lies  the  specificity  of  feminist  spaces. 
Participants' stories about themselves, the everyday life of the FSs, the interventions during public 
protests  always  draw  on  an  affective  vocabulary.  The  recurrence  of  these  expressions  (i.e.  the 
expression of feelings, emotions, perceptions to describe collective action) was a striking element 
from  the  outset.  Inductively  following  this  vocabulary  of  affects,  I  tried  to  understand  why  the 
reference to emotions was so recurrent, so instinctive, and so legitimate. The story FSs tell about their 
collective  action  is  a  story  of  emotions,  because  the  difference  of  feminist  politics  relies  in 
conceptualising and learning to use these emotions. This is why the question about safer spaces has 
become a question about the dynamics and mechanisms that produce feminist collective action, about 
the work on affects and emotions.  
In this section, I will focus on the work on affects at the meso level. I will look at feminist spaces as 
physical spaces, communities, and political organisations, bound up with affects. How do affects such 
as fear, anger, and discontent ground the choice of managing a physical place as a collective action? 
Why do participants refer to these physical places as safer spaces, by calling into question an affective 
vocabulary?  
To answer these questions, I will look at two aspects. First, at the process of becoming feminist spaces 
through the construction of structures of feelings, organisational forms, and non-ephemeral collective 

140 
 
action that proceed in continuity. This section looks at the literature on free spaces and occupied 
spaces, which has investigated the choice of social movements to open up and manage spaces (both 
physical and virtual), often linked to urban contexts. Second, to the way in which affects are mobilised 
in collective action.  
 
Beyond Free Spaces: The Politics of Places and Structures of Feelings 
Over time, the dimension of space has attracted increasing interest in social movements studies. Both 
ethnographic studies and critical geography have shown that space is socially constructed (Massey 
1995). What role does space play in relation to social movements? Della Porta and Fabbri put forward 
that  “social  movements  occur  in  specific  spatial  settings  and  flow  out  of  the  interplay  of  space, 
identities and resources. Their context is critical to a range of important actions. The struggle over 
space, the context of place and the politics of scale are constituting elements of social movements” 
(2016: 182). Referring to Lefebvre’s work (1991), space matters for social movements in the sense 
of perceived space, conceived space and lived space, where the previous two interplay (della Porta 
and Fabbri 2016). Space is affected by and affects social movements. Space can serve as the scale of 
social action, as the environment where social movements take place, and as the agency of collective 
actors with regard to the structure (Caciagli 2021).  
According  to  the  social  production  of  space  and  the  agency  of  collective  actors,  other  social 
movements scholars engaged with the concept of free spaces. Polletta and Kretschmer define free 
spaces as “small-scale settings within a community or a movement that are removed from the direct 
control of dominant groups, are voluntary participated in, and generate the cultural challenge that 
precedes or accompanies political mobilization, [...] [where people] envision alternative futures and 
plot strategies to realizing them” (2013). Free spaces are alternative spaces produced within and 
against the neoliberal and profit-oriented urban and social structure. Although these spaces can be 
understood  in  very  different  ways,  including  virtual  spaces,  this  research  takes  into  account  the 
literature that analyses free spaces as physical spaces. With regard to social movements, squatting 
practices have been explored as prefigurative politics (Epstein 1991, Yates 2015) or direct social 
action (Bosi and Zamponi 2015) that engage with social inequality and uncaring institutions Authors 
like Pruijit (2003, 2013) sought to explain the squatting practice according to the level of political 
awareness of squatters. However, the analysis of the practices of utilisation of occupied buildings 
(Filiieule et al. 2009) and the analysis of the creation of alternative social relations in the present do 
not adequately grasp neither the social actors that engage with that, nor the link between practices 
and political elaboration, as Caciagli aims to develop (2012).

Building on these works, this research aims to look at FSs as alternative structures of feelings with 
regard to the urban scale, the gender regime, and the neoliberal economic model. In the field of 
cultural studies, Raymond Williams (1954, 1969) coined the term “structures of feeling” to challenge 
the Gramscian definition of hegemony. The dominant way of thinking is always questioned by an 
inner dynamic, where different ways of thinking and feeling emerge. The use of feeling rather than 
thought alludes to a tension, an assemblage of emotions, rationality, affect, frames, bodies. By looking 
at  the  interaction  between  life  forms,  everyday  practice,  and  institutions  and  power,  Williams 
complements the analysis of material and social infrastructure with the one of affective infrastructure, 
as “the delicate infrastructure regulating our propensities and modes of presence and participation in 
social situations” (Sharma and Tygstrup 2015: 8). Building on Williams’s concept of structures of 
feeling, I will look at feminist movements and the creation of alternative structures of feelings through 
the politics of places. The politics of places is a strategic choice put forward by feminist groups to 
root their everyday action in a physical place, that can be reached by other people, that can be crossed 
and can serve as a point of reference for the feminist community. The management of a physical 
space allows on the one hand to develop direct social action and prefigurative politics, and on the 
other hand to pursue forms of political elaboration. Yet, the literature fails to understand the role that 
collective affects and emotions play in the spatialisation of collective action. Space is in fact socially 
produced within a certain structure of feelings. If the subject has always been regarded as a rational 
and strategy-oriented actor, this view prevents us from looking at the affects that equally construct 
the  way  in  which  actors  move,  make  decisions,  interact,  and  choose.  The  social  world  is  also 
constructed  by  emotions,  and  emotions  are  the  product  of  social  and  power  relations.  The 
organisational  forms  and  collective  configurations  are  consistent  with  the  creation  of  alternative 
structures  of  feelings  where  affects  serve  as  the  ground  for  action,  and  action  produces  positive 
affects
17
. The organisation, as well as the physical space, is affected by emotions and produces certain 
type of emotions. Studies on political organisation (Gamson 1975, Wher 1986, Staggenborg 1989) 
and  deliberative  democracy  (della  Porta  2005,  2013,  della  Porta  and  Rucht  2013)  suggest  that 
planning discussion, horizontality, timing of speeches, decision-making process, are part of how a 
movement defines itself, combining claims with practices. According to della Porta’s work (2013), 
democratic boundaries can be expanded through participation and deliberation, channelled by social 
movement  organisations.  Organisation  is  taken  into  account  in  this  research  as  a  practice  that

 When I use the concept of positive affect, I am not referring to positivity per se – such as the feeling of joy, excitement, 
surprise, enthusiasm. Even emotions that are normally considered negative, such as anger or indignation, are in fact 
transformative emotions in FSs. By positive affect I refer to the taking on of affects (of various kinds) as tools that increase 
the potential for collective action. In this sense, both traditionally considered positive and negative affects fall under the 
concept of positive affects for collective action.

preserves  collective  action  on  affects,  and  does  not  overstep  the  emotional  plane  in  view  of  the 
elaboration  of  strategies  and  tactics.  Strategies  emerge,  are  shaped  and  oriented  by  the  work  on 
affects. 
By referring to the women’s movement in the US, Staggenborg assesses that “informal, decentralized 
structure [...] together with ideological approach, encouraged strategic and tactical innovation, but 
undermined  organizational maintenance,”  while  “formalized  and  centralized  structure  facilitated 
organizational  maintenance,  but  led  to  a  narrowing  of  strategies  and  tactics”  (1989:  75).  She 
concludes that a successful social movement should include both types of organisational structures. 
This analysis, that fits quite well with the cases under investigation, lacks an understanding of affects 
and their interplay with the organisational structures. Organisational choices are part of the process 
of production of the structure of feelings, that encourages certain emotions to emerge, and favours 
the conscious use of these emotions.   
Starting  from  this  different  structure  of  feelings,  the  research  intends  to  look  at  power,  in  the 
Spinozian sense, expressed by FSs as collective actors. In this sense, the research aims to contribute 
to the literature on free spaces and squatting practices, as well as direct social action and prefigurative 
politics, by building on the concept of affect. 
 
Mobilising Affects between Emotions, Cognition and Body 
Social movement scholars, partially responding to a resource mobilisation approach that put too much 
emphasis on rationality, raised the importance of cultural and ideational factors, through concepts 
like collective identity (Laraña et al. 1994; Melucci 1996), cognitive praxis (Eyerman and Jamison 
1991) and framing (Snow et al. 1986). In spite of a progressive bridge between different approaches, 
differences  remain  for  example,  between  the  use  of  cognitive  factors  among  others  to  explain 
mobilisation  (McAdam  et  al.  1986)  or  the  capacity  of  social  movements  to  change  history  by 
introducing  new  conceptual  tools.  According  to  Melucci  (1996),  social  movements  provide  new 
codes to understand reality in a new way, and they contribute to change behaviours, knowledge, and 
ideas of the world, thus contributing to social change. As well as cognitive practice, FSs provide 
attention to the bodily dimension. The creation of new codes and new ways of understanding reality 
takes place through the reconciliation of the body, its needs, its instincts, its perceptions. In this sense, 
affects, as gradients of intensity that move and influence bodies and cognition, represent a channel of 
mediation, a tool for political elaboration, a competence in action. Fear for the forms of violence 
experienced in everyday life, anger at the feeling of powerlessness often linked to these experiences, 
desire for other women, pleasure, are all affects and moving forces that interplay in the action of FSs. 
The tension that binds bodies together, bodies and objects, bodies and space, represents a source of 

143 
 
transformative energy on a cognitive and bodily level, which changes the potential of collective 
action. This potential changes when affects, as gradients of intensity, are mobilised in collective 
action. In this sense, a use of affect is developed, which means 1) a work of naming, decoding and 
understanding affects at stake; 2) a work oriented to stimulate positive affects for collective action – 
which does not only mean positive affects per se, such as well-being, but also anger and conflict as a 
generative force; 3) the conscious use of affect in the choice of goals, counterparts, strategies, and 
action. From this analysis it is clear how conscious work on affects does not detract from collective 
action but, on the contrary, enhances it.  
What do participants feel, and how do they account for this feeling in political action? How do affects 
shape FSs’ cognitive and bodily practices, political elaboration, internal dynamics and goals?  
To search for an answer, I will go through the mobilisation of affects in collective action. To preserve 
this work, FSs elaborate on caring practices that allow participants to take their time to develop tools, 
to explore meanings, and to learn to use emotions. In order to look at this process, I will introduce 
the concept of caring spaces. As Radicioni and Weicht stress out, “care is traditionally provided by 
female family members, usually in people’s private homes, sometimes institutionally supported. This 
traditional arrangement of care is consequentially embedded in heterosexual families, the emotional 
primacy of the own home and public policies oriented towards the support of families. However, the 
imagined patterns of people, places and times of care are themselves part of a situated narrative 
evolving over time and space” (2018: 369). Care has been a milestone of feminist reflections. It has 
been historically considered as an attribute of women, and feminists struggled at length to dismantle 
this supposedly feminine skill. Back to the 1970s, feminists worked on other forms of connection and 
support beyond the nuclear family. Still nowadays, care is a crucial issue for FSs. Caring spaces are 
consistent with the creation of structures of feelings: care lets affects and emotions emerge, it creates 
a positive environment to deal with them, as well as the condition to transform those emotions into 
political feelings.  
This  analysis  aims  to  contribute  to  the  literature  on  cognitive  practices,  collective  identity,  and 
repertoire of action, by developing the understanding of emotions not only at the individual level but 
also at the meso level of spaces and collective action.  
 
 
6.2 Becoming Feminist Spaces 
 
 
6.2.1 Affect and Places  
 

144 
 
In this section, I will start to outline the production of alternative structures of feelings pursued by 
FSs through the analysis of the interplay between affect and places. The long-term life of a physical 
space has an influence on the type of collective action. To start from conceptualisation, I will look at 
how the physical and architectural features of spaces are bound up with affects. To begin with, I will 
look at the practice of separate spaces (attended by women, lesbians, non-binary, and trans people) 
that prepares the ground for the creation of alternative structures of feelings. Then, I will look at how 
strategies and tactics produce different structures of feelings. Occupying, renting, or managing an 
institutional  place  produce  different  affective  structures  for  participants,  and  participants’  affects 
differently shape strategic choices. What does it mean to work on affects in a physical place? Which 
affects materially produce the space, and what does that space allow participants to do? How do 
different strategies produce different types of spaces? 
According to the literature on free spaces (Evans and Boyte 1986, Polletta 1999, Staggenborg 2001), 
social movements often resort to managing a space in order to locate their political action in a site, 
but also to strengthen collective action. These spaces operate within the movement, as in the case of 
women-only spaces in the 1970s. As a CID interviewee explains, the idea of managing a physical 
space helps to localise collective action. Through the metaphor of the plant, she explains how a space 
is a concrete subject which can build collective action in continuity: 
Through  a  physical  structure,  an  address,  a  telephone  number,  a  P.O.  box,  through  decent, 
receptive places and so on, you take place in the world. It is visible, but not because the rest of 
the movement is not visible, but because it has a root. You plant a seed and a tree grows. This 
tree is part of a forest. It does not have to be the only tree on the whole planet. But in the meantime 
you take care of your tree, because you have to root it. (IR9, CID, 72)  
 
All FSs taken into account are politically separate. It is not a biological division from males, but a 
political choice based on feminism. As a CS participant develops, “by feminists we mean politically 
separated  spaces,  [...]  the  backbone  of  their  struggles  are  feminist  and  transfeminist  struggles.” 
(IIIR2, CS, 37). Some spaces coming from the 1970s also experienced separatism based on biology, 
and  they  still  questioned  the  openness  of  the  space  to  a  male  presence.  As  retrieved  from  my 
fieldnotes: “Laura says to Lisa: ‘Every time I see the men at the House, I get a shock... But what are 
they doing there? When did they enter?’ And Lisa answers: ‘Look, don't tell me, I've never agreed. 
But at a certain point they wanted us to let them in’” (Fieldnotes, CID, 11-11-18). This exchange 
between two CID participants shows how the presence of men within the space is still perceived as 
dissonant,  out  of  place,  highlighting  the  marked  separation,  even  biological,  that  has  long  been 
constitutive of some FSs. 
Male presence is not forbidden, but is at the edges. The political irrelevance of cisgender men shapes 
perceptions of the space and the way of doing politics. The reference to men concerns masculinity as 

145 
 
a gender and as social interaction. In this sense, a CS interviewee explains that “men create very 
different dynamics” (IIIR5, CS, 30). The need for a political separate place often emerged for FSs’ 
participants after periods of mixed politics, that means politics with men. Participants felt tired of that 
interaction which seemed to decrease their capacity for feminist collective action. In a gendered 
regime  where  masculinity  is  still  a  socially  connoted  gender,  in  the  sense  of  role  expectations, 
performance and power, the social production of space also depends on the gender dimension. The 
need to produce other spaces, out of alternative gender dynamics, stimulates the desire for FSs, as 
explained by a CS interviewee: “It is born from the desire to experiment in a gender field without the 
hetero cis male comrades. Without thinking you always have something to learn from them. Can we 
make it on our own? And in my opinion we can do it” (IIIR10, CS, 30). The experience of occupying 
a separate space, and of taking care of all the practical aspects of the occupation without the male 
intervention (such as electricity, plumbing, relations with neighbours, and so on) is considered as new 
and  exciting.  In  addition,  learning  to  manage  those  skills  normally  considered  masculine  is  an 
empowering and consciousness-raising process for participants, that puts the body in place and at 
work.  
This choice of political separatism often draws critiques to FSs, accusing them of being ghettos. It 
stems from the idea that when a space is not inclusive of everyone it produces exclusion. When I 
openly addressed this issue to the interviewees, they always asked: “who is moving the critique?”. 
“For some male comrades, yes, they are ghettos. That they are exclusive for them. [...] I think that 
women's spaces are exclusive of a certain type of male sociality. And it's okay that they are” (IIIR3, 
CS, 30). As the Roestone Collective argues:  
we understand safe spaces to be inclusive precisely as they are exclusive. They foreground and 
challenge binaries through “messy negotiations” (Hunter 2008:17) of difference, comfort and 
safety.  Safe  space,  as we  interpret  it,  is  not  merely  an  attempt  to  create  an  abstract  sense  of 
equality, to smooth over differences, or to step outside of and ignore the dangers and injustices of 
the  world.  The  work  of  producing  safe  space  entails  continually  facing,  negotiating,  and 
embracing  paradoxical  binaries:  safety/danger,  inclusivity/exclusivity,  public/private,  and  so 
forth” (Roestone 2015: 1355)  
 
Different  practices  originate  different  types  of  spaces:  occupying,  renting  a  place,  negotiating  a 
usufruct with the municipality. Depending on the strategic choices, spaces present different affective 
structures. While two of them are occupied buildings (LYS and CS), one negotiated a low-rent with 
the  municipality  (CID).  The  strategy  of  occupying  is  bound  up  with  feelings  of  empowerment, 
strength, and pride, though, on the other side, feelings of fear and insecurity coming from the illegal 
status somehow decrease the capacity for action. While the low-rent ensures a certain well-being and 
stability (never definitive, since they are spaces from below), on the other hand this stability let 

146 
 
negative emotions emerge, such as conflicts, the loss of solidity of the political community, and the 
weakening of collective identity. 
A lot of interviewees underline the empowerment coming from occupying buildings. Whether all the 
spaces here taken into account were born as occupations, not all of them are currently valuing this 
practice as central to their repertoire of action. Across a generational line, one might argue that 
younger activists are more willing to claim it, depending on a more radical and provocative approach 
to politics. For some of them, occupying is considered as “a powerful experience” that gives “the 
sense of breathing a little bit of freedom and creating different spaces and sociality” (IIIR10, CS, 30). 
Occupying  allows  the  possibility  to  challenge  institutions  and  their  management  of  the  city;  to 
independently handle a space and its functions; to shape the space according to counter-systems of 
values and meanings; to re-enhance unused buildings against real estate speculation and urban decay. 
These elements strengthen the cohesion of the community, because of the definition of common 
external enemies and the sense of changing the world and its worst structures.  
On the other hand, strategic choices including negotiation with institutions lead to a relative degree 
of stability and thus to more tempered emotions. Dealing with bureaucracy, with institutions, forces 
a certain degree of mediation and specialisation, which dampens the overwhelming enthusiasm of 
occupying.  This  strategic  choice  can  also  result  in  internal  conflicts,  discontent,  and  the  loss  of 
community  cohesion,  also  due  to  the  disappearance  of  the  external  enemy  and  a  conflictual 
confrontation with the institutions. During a chat at the CID, a participant told me the reasons why 
women get to the CID: “There is a complex of relationships that have the CID as their core and that 
could not have the same affection, effectiveness and timeliness if they were elsewhere, in another 
place. The CID is an environment that nurtures relationships between women” (Fieldnotes, CID, 12-
11-18). The relative stability of the physical location makes it more accessible to women. This stable 
affective structure has an impact on the surrounding reality, and allows the CID to endure over time 
as a reference point. 
The spaces under investigation are places. Places are always socially produced, and they are the result 
of social interactions. FSs have physical characteristics and architectural features, that shape the type 
of politics activists can envision. They are located in a city and a neighbourhood, with their own story 
of inhabitants and use. If one cannot clearly assess a causal mechanism – from one use to another – 
one can get how the changing nature of these places influence their inhabitants over time. The “secret 
life of places,” the way the four walls happen to host different experiences one after the other, suggest 
a link to inquiry.  
The CID is located in an old monastery. Fiorensoli (1999) investigated the consequent communities 
inhabiting the space: first, a prison for women considered deviant, and much later a FS occupied by 

147 
 
activists. This parable illustrates the feminist attitude to subvert the meaning of words, places, or 
events, toward an empowering change. The past pain and sufferings of inmate women has been 
transformed by the contemporary use: women are still inhabiting the place, but changing the nature 
of  the  former  setting.  The  architectural  dimension  keeps  shaping  women’s  activities.  The  large 
dimension of the building, the numerous small rooms with little windows, long dark corridors, large 
walls that in a way separate it from the outside, are elements conditioning the type of things activists 
can do, and also the affective structure. The building is dispersed and sometimes makes it difficult to 
meet each other; the corridors encourage small talks and the passing on of negative affect.   
LYS, on the other hand, used to be an old railway station where the keeper slept. The presence of a 
large  garden  and  several  buildings  has  made  it  possible  to  develop  collective  actions  aimed  at 
welcoming women and minors, carrying out political actions, an anti-violence desk, and some work 
activities (such as a psychological desk and a tailor's shop). The architectural features increase a sense 
of well-being for those who live there, inviting people to participate both occasionally and on a regular 
basis. The open-air garden, the plants, and the large space, in an extremely urbanised and populated 
neighbourhood, make LYS an attractive place, which stimulates feelings of pleasure and well-being.  
In the case of CS, the building happened to be a nightclub, with strippers, clients, and probably sex 
workers. Even though they did not know about the former use of the space, they immediately felt a 
correspondence  between  the  space  and  their  own  identity  as  a  political  community,  as  a  CS 
interviewee develops:  
When we entered in 2013 [...] I remember the power to open that door and find a former nightclub. 
Already that is structurally different from other occupations in Rome. [...] And we kept it as a 
nightclub, like the glitter on the walls, the red paint, however gloomy, dark, there is no light, for 
years. [...] And in my opinion it's no coincidence that we decided to leave it like that. Because 
that stuff is a part of us. Visually disturbing those who come in and making you feel this sense of 
lack of air, of lack of light, is like entering a mix between a cave, a night club, a place of perdition. 
It is the imaginary of CS. (IIIR10, CS, 30) 
 
Certain physical elements – such as the colour of the walls, the light of the space – are socially 
interpreted as expressions of the imagery and narrative of the FSs. The challenge to the gender regime 
and heteronormative sexuality is perceived as frightening and provocative in relation to the dominant 
way of thinking, and these feelings are reproduced by the physical characteristics of the space. The 
empathy with the girls working at the nightclub convinced the activists to contact and involve some 
of them in the occupation, trying to prefigure a feminist way to subvert the place. The physical 
features of the space shape the political activities, such as the pole dance lab, thanks to the presence 
of a stage and four poles, or the presence of big central spaces and a lot of small privées, encouraging 
big initiatives but also intimate types of encounters. This changing nature of the space has been the 
occasion  for  a  political  debate,  since  the  local  press  immediately  wrote  about  “the  good  girls” 

148 
 
managing an anti-violence service that changed “a place of exploitation of women,” an interpretation 
that the CS proudly opposed. 
The section shows how certain physical characteristics of the place and the type of management 
(occupation, payment of rent, etc.) generate different affects. In the interaction between bodies and 
spaces, and between bodies and objects, affects are constantly being produced as a result of this 
interaction. Reflection on the physical dimension of spaces is the first step in understanding the 
formation of FSs as structures of feelings.  
 
 
6.2.2 Organisation: A Political Matter 
 
Organisation reflects a way of imagining and producing a feminist space. It shapes the space, and lets 
a certain environment, climate, and feelings emerge. According to this interpretation, I will look at 
how organisation is bound up with affects, and which use of affects organisation allows to perform.  
Organisation is oriented by strategic thinking, by the assemblages between bodies and affects that 
circulate and are at stake in the interaction. As a CID interviewee notices, “this place only stands for 
that, because beyond the structure and beyond this pyramid, there is the body, there is the earth. [...] 
This  place  exists  and  resists  because  it  is  made  of  true  bodies,  true  minds,  true  solidarity,  true 
friendships, true sisterhoods, true loves, everything.” (IR9, CID, 72). Bodies and affects represent 
places  of  mediation  between  the  space  and  goals  of  collective  action,  and  serve  to  calibrate  the 
organisational style that each FS chooses to perform.  In this section, I will try to analyse the way in 
which affects orient different organisational choices of FSs. 
The CID is structured through a quite defined hierarchy and a centralised type of management, that 
handles power and decisions. The space preserves a feminist attitude, and this is expressed through, 
for instance, the role of the president, who does not manage the CID as a boss but as a feminist 
activist: she performs horizontal relations with everyone, she knows all the people coming and doing 
activities at the CID, and she cares about a collaborative way of management (Fieldnotes, CID, 20-
10-18). This type of organisation is highly contested by its participants, because of several reasons. 
It led the CID to be tiring and stuffy. Some of them identify that process as bureaucratisation: “that 
is, you can't run it as if the House is a small business. The House has employees, it has a turnover, 
and therefore theoretically it is a business. But in the meantime it is a place for women, it is a social 
place, and therefore also management requires that this dimension be always taken into account. 
Because  if  you  lose  this  dimension  you  lose  your  soul”  (IR6,  CID,  67).  Bureaucratisation, 
institutionalisation  and  corporatisation  are  suggested  by  some  elements,  like  the  presence  at  the 

149 
 
reception of women that do not have a feminist background (sometimes they do not even solidarise), 
and  a  lack  in  the  architectural  accommodation,  which  continues  to  look  like  a  prison  or  an 
administrative office. This physical and relational setting produces negative affects, as an interviewee 
argues: “relationship problems, [result] from lack of transparency, poor communication, lack of trust” 
(IR8, CID, 68). Contradictions, together with the moment of crisis and the threat of eviction, trigger 
a will to change. Negative affects counterbalance the effectiveness of the organisational structure, 
diminishing  the  political  capacity  of  the  space.  For  this  reason,  especially  in  view  of  the  crisis 
experienced by the CID, many of the participants hope for a change oriented at combining an effective 
structure, the work on collective affects, and the recovery of the political role of space.
 
LYS shows a certain level of formalised and centralised structure, but a high level of innovation in 
terms of strategies and tactics. The urge to manage direct social action orients towards a structured 
kind of organisation (with clear roles, responsibilities, and functions), as well as an openness to 
innovate strategies. Practical activity, the relation with women escaping violence, and the need for 
accountability have led to an increased formalisation of the organisation, together with flexibility in 
order to keep being open to women’s needs, problem-solving, and the fight against the threat of 
eviction.  Participants  manage  the  space  depending  on  needs,  structuring  internal  rules  through  a 
shared process: as an example, every two years they re-write the internal regulation together with 
activists and women living at LYS, with dispositions about the daily life of the space, its practical 
organisation, and political arrangements. These processes enabled LYS to harmonise an effective 
structure with constant work on collective affects, from which the choice of strategies and tactics 
follows. The  flexible  arrangements  with  a  core  structured  organisation  guarantee  an  effective 
management of direct social action, and on the other hand a creative attitude toward campaigns, 
actions, and claims. 
During  the  fieldwork,  a  woman  told  me  that  “differently  than  the  male  linear  management,  the 
feminist one is a circular management” (Fieldnotes, CID, 23-10-18). I delved into the notion of 
circular management in order to understand how FSs are frequently considered as welcoming and 
cosy for people attending. In the case of CS, the management of the space creates an environment in 
which well-structured rituals of politics decline, as highlighted by this quote:  
We are in 2013, 2014, the first karaoke of the Cagne and you saw people on stage singing together 
drunk, hugging... people coming from anarchist and autonomous spaces, disobedient and blah 
blah blah. [...] They were people with a history of conflict [...], and yet they breathed a different 
air. And the Cagne have brought this stuff here over the years. Which is a huge strength. (IIIR10, 
CS, 30) 
 
CS has a less structured and centralised management, defending deliberative democracy, participation 
and horizontality. The following quote from a CS interviewee summarises the choice for horizontality 

150 
 
and individual autonomy: “Depending on where you go, you find a different Cagna [posto che vai, 
Cagna che trovi]! This is our must!” (IIIR7, CS, 30). They refuse hierarchies and representation, and 
find ways to name power dynamics that are always at stake in human interactions. Creative strategies 
allow to unveil power dynamics by preserving positive affects, as clearly assessed by this quote:  
At the beginning of our assembly [...] there were never-ending interventions... [...] This stuff 
didn't work for us anymore [...] and so somebody proposed this thing: each one took a few caps, 
and when they had the feeling that the intervention was taking too long, [...] you threw a cap at 
the person who was talking (laughs). [...] In the beginning they were almost a necessity, giving 
you time, marking the interventions, all these things... and slowly with time they disappeared. But 
they disappeared because we started to have shared practices, common practices. (IIIR4, CS, 30) 
 
This political organisation develops a double structure: a great attention to internal dynamics and 
individual possibility to participate, and on the other hand a loose planning of tactics and goals. The 
group rejects hierarchies and a defined plan of activity, both inside and outside the space, and they 
are heavily oriented by collective affect, as the quote shows: “We only do the things we feel” (IIIR4, 
CS, 30). This radical approach to emotions roots organisation and strategies in a profoundly feminist 
but sometimes ineffective practice. As any other space, they are not free from contradictions, and 
hierarchies  are  often  implicit.  This  management  sometimes  leads  to  frustration,  as  a  participant 
outlines: “This was very difficult for me to accept, that we were a somewhat... inconsistent collective. 
Not coherent. [...] At a certain moment I had the impression that we had all put feminism in front of 
the rest of our bio-political positions or facets, but that fact no longer seemed political” (IIIR6, CS, 
35). The risk of disorganisation or less effective political action is the other face of the coin of a purely 
free and inclusive type of organisation. However, this loose structure is also a source of change and 
innovation in their repertoire of action, symbols, and codes.  
In this section, I outlined how different organisational structures interplay with different structures of 
feelings (Williams 1961), producing more or less effective collective action. All of them show how 
affects are related to FSs, at all the levels of collective action: from micro ties among individuals to 
political choices of organisation.

6.3.1 Safety as a Process  
 
 Retrieved from the fieldnotes: Wednesday afternoon, assembly at LYS with participants and women hosted at 
the  space.  A  participant  introduces  some  issues  concerning  the  current  threat  of  eviction,  and  some 
alternatives for women living at the space in order to avoid the eventual raid by police forces. Women begin 
to worry and to ask for clarifications. They are scared, because they don’t want to go back to loneliness, 

151 
 
precarity and their aggressor’s leash. Another participant tells them to keep calm and focus on their own path 
of recovery, autonomy and self-determination, because it is the only way to change their life. She says that if 
they need reassurances, they, as activists, are ready to talk thousands of times about the threat of eviction, 
their emotions and strategies to resist. At that point Alla, the Russian woman, intervenes, saying (in a sketchy 
Italian)  that  she  has  participated  many  times  in  demonstrations  and  parades – against  Putin,  for  the 
environment and other things, but she has never felt like she does in feminist demonstrations. That all this 
gives her great strength and she feels she can change her life and fight. After her a young Arab girl intervenes, 
saying that she has thought about it, and in any case even if she won’t live here anymore, if she has to leave, 
even from outside she would fight for the house because she wants such a place to exist [...]. Because when 
she and her mother arrived in Italy as refugees, they asked everyone for help, they knocked on a thousand 
doors, but nobody answered, and they were completely alone. And when they knocked on LYS's door it was 
immediately opened, and they were no longer alone. So they would fight in any case for there to be a place in 
the world where you stop being alone [...]. Next to me Sandra and Claudia, activists of Lucha y Siesta, whisper 
in their ear that they are moved and they want to cry. All the women seem to be moved and there are a few 
seconds of silence, as if the words had remained in mid-air among us (Fieldnotes, LYS, 19-06-19) 
 
In  the  previous  sections,  I  began  to  thematise  the  construction  of  FSs  as  structures  of  feelings 
according to the physical and organisational dimensions. Now, I will focus on the social production 
of FSs, starting from the interaction between affects, bodies and cognition. As the quote above shows, 
the discussion, political elaboration, and formulation of action of FSs is suffused by an affective grid 
that orients participants to listen, share, and negotiate. Affect mediates bodily and cognitive practices, 
and through affect participants formulate the name of their needs, of their willingness or not to engage 
with action. Affects, moreover, produce the imperceptible cloud through which participants feel their 
experience as a community. Affects are also limits to action: they signal a boundary, a point beyond 
which the emotional infrastructure does not hold and the group would be compromised. In this sense, 
it is clear that the reference to safety is the result of an affective process of elaboration, and that it is 
the process, and not the final outcome, that stimulates in the participants the sense of living in safer 
places. In this sense, the perception of a greater or lesser security emerges from a certain structure of 
feelings.  
In this section, I will try to focus on the process through which the structure of feelings is created, in 
the interaction between emotions, cognition, and bodies. A structure of feelings that stimulates the 
perception of security is not in fact a stable configuration, nor a concluded affective place, but an 
open-ended process in which the elements are continuously negotiated and changed. That is why I do 
not refer to safe spaces but to safer spaces, to recall the process towards the creation of these structures 
of feelings, rather than a final version of them, which is never feasible. Lewis, Sharp, Remnant and 
Redpath  write  that  the  process  goes  from  being  “safe  from  (fear,  misogyny,  harassment,  online 
violence, domestic violence, abuses, triggers, victimization, aggression)” to become “safe to (fully 
human, enabling dialogue, mediated conflict solidarity, be what they want to be)” (2014: 3-4).  
In this section, I seek to explain the process of becoming safer through cognitive practices, bodily 
consciousness, and the mediation of affect. First, I will look at the cognitive practices through which 

152 
 
FSs locate idea on interpretation, and orientation. Then, I will explore how participants elaborate on 
the  inequalities  that  reverberate  in  their  own  life,  by  transforming  negative  affect  into  positive 
emotions. Finally, I will look at the creation of community ties as a source of safety and well-being.  
All the FSs taken into account agree on the interpretation of gender-based violence as structural to 
social reality. According to their framing, violence innervates all spheres of people's lives – in the 
family, in private life, at home, at work, in the urban space, and so on – as a form of distributing 
power and maintaining a certain social, political, and gender order. This understanding of violence 
makes people feel “lucky” if they did not incur into harassment or violence, as this quote of a LYS 
interviewee shows: “to me personally, which is something that sometimes seems incredible, nothing 
has ever happened. [...] So I live a lucky life compared to statistics.” (IIR2, LYS, 37). The statistical 
element, i.e. the quantitative distribution of feminicides, abuse, harassment, violence, is combined 
with the political element, which interprets these data as the expression of a social phenomenon, a 
distribution of power, a certain economic, cultural, and social order. 
The cognitive practice on gender-based violence and the gender regime stems from individual bodily 
and affective perceptions. On the one hand, there is the sharing of the sensations of the body, which 
is harnessed in relations of power, and on which violence produces tangible consequences. On the 
other hand, there are the emotions that violence produces, as a system of domination and control that 
limits  the  possibilities  of  agency,  orients  biographical  expectations,  and  shapes  cognitive  codes. 
Affects emerge as a mediation between body sensations and social structures, helping participants to 
place their experience in time and space, and giving individual experience a collective and social 
framework. From this understanding of violence, as a system that organises social life, follows the 
choice to create physical and political spaces in which to challenge violence through the production 
of other codes. FSs represent the spatialisation of this alternative, as the following quote from CS 
interviewee explains further: 
We need shelter because the world sucks. [...] Because for the world we are freaks, unacceptable. 
We are people who lead dysfunctional existences for most of the functional trajectories of the 
capitalist system. [...] It is a dangerous world. It's a world where so many of us have experienced 
a  lot  of  violence.  On  various  levels.  Starting  with  families  but  also  life on  the  street,  life  in 
relationships. We need a place to shelter. Which can be a physical place or not. One cannot always 
be in the front line. Sometimes you need to stop and breathe. Shelter is a place where you stop 
for a moment to breathe. Maybe not alone. (IIIR10, CS, 30) 
 
A further consequence is the question of security. If violence is systemic, those to whom it is directed 
– women,  lesbians,  trans,  and  non-binary  people – experience  daily  feelings  of  insecurity,  fear, 
powerlessness.  Violence  operates  through  a  constriction  of  the  possibilities  of  the  body  and  a 
limitation of cognitive abilities, of the feeling of being able to react. From this bodily and cognitive 
pattern comes the desire for a place to question and transform violence. The frequent reference of 

153 
 
participants to the need to feel safer stems from these assumptions, and therefore spaces are places 
where the process towards a greater sense of security is pursued. As a LYS participant explains, 
individual mobilisation stems from the desire to change the emotional consequences of violence: 
I felt in a protected space where the risks I perceived were no longer there, of course [...]. I was 
no longer a frightened child but a woman who was choosing to start along a new path. So let's say 
that for me entering Lucha was [...] the desire to put an end to this fear that I have always had of 
male violence. (IIR5, LYS, 30) 
 
Cognitive and bodily liberation from violence as a pattern of thought occurs through the mediation 
of affects. They help to name what is experienced, to share it with other people, to find transformative 
solutions.  Cognitive  liberation  is  always  a  liberation  of  the  body,  mediated  by  emotions  that 
consolidate the process. This is why in FSs there is work on negative and positive emotions, and the 
construction of structures of feelings that allow the subjects to feel better. A CS interviewee argues 
with regard to FS, “first of all it is a space where the subjectivities that transfeminism calls into 
question feel comfortable, welcome, protected... not so safe, because in my opinion a transfeminist 
space is not a space without contradictions, without bullshit, without violence, without... no... but it 
is a space where there is the possibility that these things can be faced.” (IIIR7, CS, 30). The creation 
of structures of feelings is a process in which violence does not disappear, nor do hegemonic patterns 
of thought, but both are continuously challenged in collective practice. 
Within the space, participants collectively reflect on social inequalities, by exploring how social 
structures are grounded in their own life, and how negative affects coming from these structures can 
be transformed into positive ones. The first step is the capacity to have a positive representation of 
the self, to understand what is good and what is bad to experience, and to be aware about their own 
rights. As a woman hosted at LYS says, “all these women I know from many years ago, the first thing 
they taught me is that we have rights, but sometimes they don't give you those rights. Sometimes you 
have to take them” (IIIR9, LYS, 66). Bad negatives – such as fear, anger, or loneliness – that decrease 
the capacity for action are transformed into bravery, trust, and confidence. The capacity to be aware 
of the self, with regard to women escaping violence, can mark the difference between being killed or 
surviving. Thus, safer spaces are not oriented toward a general comfort and well-being, but to the 
achievement of material tools of survival. That is why a woman hosted at LYS defines the space as 
“an artificial lung, an artificial heart” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 11-07-19). This definition calls into question 
an assemblage of bodies, spaces, technologies, tools to counter the individual experience of violence 
and structures of inequalities through a re-evaluation of the capacities of the self. The process of 
acquiring strength and autonomy is long and tough, and spaces are needed in order to have the 
possibility to rest. Safety is also about having at disposal time and space to recovery, out of the 
running requirements of neoliberal society. As a LYS interviewee claims: 

154 
 
People live here who need a place where they can recover, where they can concentrate a little 
more on their lives without necessarily having to continue to fight for minimum rights. [...] All 
moments of change are painful, difficult, often this space hosts people who don't even know the 
language  we  speak  in  this  piece  of  land.  And  so  you  know  you  need  time  to  organise  your 
thoughts, relax for a moment, feel safe. (IIR1, LYS, 37) 
 
In the process of achievement of the representation of the self, affects are questioned and transformed. 
As a CS participant recounts, acquiring self-confidence and the capacity to deal with daily situations 
of violence is not external, but internal to individuals. It is a process of understanding and working 
on the self: 
I spent many years of my life with anger, strong anxiety. [...] Because I had well internalised the 
sensation of going out and not knowing [...] if you would return. Partly because you're a woman, 
partly because you're a lesbian, partly because people look at you anyway and Rome is a strange 
city, and many times it has given me proof of how violent it can be. And at a certain point it's as 
if I had made peace with it, it's as if that anxiety and fear had disappeared a little bit. And a great 
dignity has arisen to live my life as it is. (Focus Group transcription IIIRA, Rome, 10-07-19) 
 
This quote shows the shift from feelings of anxiety and fear, depending on inner dimensions of the 
self, such as being a woman and a lesbian, and reactions to it, to feelings of self-confidence and 
empowering.  The  shift  implies  the  subversion  of  violence  through  political  participation  in  FSs. 
Affects have a mediating function in understanding the structures of inequality, but they are also the 
material to be understood, with respect to which a different use must be learned. The subsequent goal 
is the achievement of “dignity” and “pride” because of one’s own existence, rather than the past fears 
and sufferings for that same existence. Moreover, this achievement does not begin and end in the FS, 
but is a general takeover in the everyday life, as a CS participant clarifies: “when I didn't have a space, 
I also lived the places of sociality in a certain way. Now I live them as if they are my space. When I 
decide to cross a space it is also mine” (IIIR3, CS, 30). 
The process from an external understanding of safety, as something that is offered to you, to an 
internal achievement is also shaping the capacity to react both in a bodily and cognitive way. Violence 
does  not  disappear,  situations  of  discomfort,  trouble,  and  bewilderment  do  not  disappear,  but 
participants learn tools to react to them. As a CS interviewee states: 
It's not that you're safe [...], the harassment in the street is the same. The point is how that stuff 
gets to you. It's one thing when it comes to you with all the effect of harassment, because maybe 
you've never found yourself thinking about it, because you've never framed it in a wider frame of 
a system that is so and so on, and so you get that stuff in all its impact [...]. Another point is when 
you've thought about that stuff, [...] you also have strategies. [...] Safety is no longer external to 
you [...]. And so it's different [...] because you've built your own [....] instrument of reaction to 
the world. So maybe today I'll take the harassment, today on the bus I'm letting go because I'm 
alone, because I know that I'll arrive home and I have my comrades. But tomorrow sooner or later 
we will punish an asshole like you. (Focus Group transcription IIIRA, Rome, 10-07-19) 
 
As the quote shows, the collective elaboration of affects enables the acquisition of both cognitive and 
bodily strength, so that the episodes of oppression are no longer experienced as purely destructive, 

155 
 
but the possibility emerges of overturning the situation of power inequality by expressing a new 
power, the result of collective action.  
This never-ending work on the self is connected to the dimension of sexism and violence. On one 
hand, the process enhances the capacity to see what is usually misread or ignored. In the Italian 
context, one woman out of three experiences situations of harassment or violence
18
, quite often in a 
climate of generalised invisibility. People are used to ignore violence, they do not have the lens to 
understand the need for help. Acquiring the capacity to see and react is part of a process of becoming 
safer. Participants produce new tools to deal with violence, and this toolkit is the basis for personal 
development and collective awareness. FSs make violence a public issue, that everyone has to deal 
with. Thus, women are not trapped in their personal stories of violence, but can find bridges in a 
community to deal with violence. As the above-mentioned quote shows, violence becomes a problem 
that is addressed collectively. 
Some participants outline how the process of naming and working on violence is something leading 
to a progressive closeness of the space, because of less trust and less confidence toward the outside 
world and people external to the intimate community. As a CS interviewee argues: 
We invested so much energy talking about violence, about violation of consent, about this kind 
of issues both in relationships and interactions [...] and the collective has lost some pieces. There 
was a level of activation on this extreme (emphatic) stuff. That pervaded everything [...]. And 
certainly this stuff led us to be a bit more reluctant to open up to the outside. (IIIR10, CS, 30) 
 
The “extra-attention” on violence also emerges as a cap to innovation, experimentation, and freedom 
to act. The goal is to take into account at the same time an open and receptive attitude, a joyful 
approach to sexuality with a strong attention on violence and abuse.  
The section points out the perception of safety as a process that involves three levels: the internal one, 
where participants work on their inner affect and emotions; the collective level, thus the elaboration 
of political elaboration out of the mobilisation of affect and emotions; the interaction with the outside. 
Safety is not a given, and the effort to produce safer spaces involves all of the people that take part in 
the everyday life of the space.  
 
 
6.3.2 The Potential of Affects 
 
You have to give legitimacy to a piece that this world does not recognise. In people's lives, at work, at the 
supermarket, in the car, on the street, you don't recognise the fact that people have an emotionality, they have 
feelings, they have a life, they have more or less stable well-being in their lives. This thing has no weight in

156 
 
the collective places of this society. Instead, inside the collective of Cagne I have learned to give it a weight 
and I have taken this stuff outside too. (IIIR6, CS, 30) 
 
In the society of time acceleration (Leccardi 2009) and dematerialisation of spaces (Giddens 1994) 
affects  come  to  be  almost  dismissed.  Life-paths  and  institutions  are  oriented  to  productivity, 
efficiency and performativity, and any other non-functional element is considered an obstacle. The 
choice of re-appropriating emotions as significant variables in the construction of life paths, political 
strategies, and goals is a practice of resistance to the economic and social structure, as the quote of a 
CS interviewee in the opening of the section accounts for.  
In the upcoming paragraphs, I will deepen the reflection by referring to the potential of affects, as the 
way in which affects intersect bodies, cognition, spaces, and objects, and generate groupings. First, I 
will explore the infrastructures of feelings of FSs. Then, I will go through well-being and happiness 
as positive affects that increase the capacity for action. The creation of community ties enhances the 
awareness  on  affects,  and  their  transformation. The  section  explores  the  potential  of  affects  for 
collective action, through the empirical examples of FSs.  
At the meso level of spaces and communities, affects, as gradients of intensity and vital forces, work 
as 1) a channel of mediation between cognition and bodies; 2) a tool for political elaboration; 3) a 
competence in action. The confidence in inner feelings (that is usually considered unpolitical) makes 
people  feel  comfortable  and  at  ease.  People  are  not  trapped  in  rituals  of  interaction  and  in  the 
performance of social encounters. In the rituals of interaction within FSs, emotions can be manifested, 
elaborated on, taken into account. While living unconventional forms of sexuality according to the 
dominant setting, the contact with feelings allows women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people to 
create a new symbolic order. As one LYS interviewee explains, the perception of greater security 
comes  from  the  affective  infrastructure  of  FSs,  where  emotions  are  considered  part  not  only  of 
individual lives but also of political action: “feeling a safe place does not necessarily mean a place 
where no one can do harm, but it is a place where I can be myself. This also makes me feel safe. A 
place where I can enter angry, I can enter sad, I can enter with someone next to me, [...] really in any 
way I can enter there and feel accepted” (IIR5, LYS, 33). This perception relates to a cognitive 
dimension (self-representation, self-expression, social acceptance) and a bodily dimension (feelings 
of calm, serenity, expression of feelings, sexuality). 
Very often during the fieldwork the participants reported positive feelings as part of an infrastructure 
of feelings created by the FSs. What does it mean to feel good? Which consequences do positive 
emotions, such as well-being and happiness, produce? How do positive emotions enhance collective 
action? What is the potential of affects for collective action? 
As the following quote from the focus group to the CSs shows, the affective infrastructure enables 

157 
 
participants to feel better, but also to increase their self-knowledge, and thus their capacity for action: 
“these spaces of confrontation always give me the feeling that I live in places that make me feel good. 
That make me have confidence” (Focus Group transcription IIIRA, Rome, 10-07-19). We are very 
poorly used to consider positive affects and emotions as part of a political understanding of social 
movements. With regard to FSs, the element recurs into the participants’ words. In his essay on 
happiness and the theory of affects, Natoli states that “human beings happen to feel happy when [...] 
they have the perception of unlimited self-expansion. [...] Who is happy, when she/he is happy, does 
not  ignore  the  limit  but  simply  does  not  perceive  it  as  an  obstacle”  (2003:  37).  By  drawing  on 
Spinoza’s concept of vital impulse, he deepens the reflection on positive affects as the source of 
power for human beings, and especially of their “expansion” in the sense of individual activation that 
increases the ability to be and to act in the world. The analysis of fieldnotes and words of participants 
allows for the interpretation of the work of/on affects in FSs as a potential for collective action. 
Building  on  Spinoza  and  Natoli’s  reflection  on  positive  affects,  this  section  explores  the  effort 
towards the construction of safer spaces, as a political action oriented towards expanding the potential 
of individuals and collective actors for social change.  
As explored at the beginning of the chapter, the arrangements of physical spaces play a role in the 
reverberation of affects. Colours, furniture, the disposition of rooms and so on, is a source of more or 
less  positive  affect.  Massey  argues  that  we  are  “living  in  spatial  times”  (2005:  61).  Despite  the 
volatility  of  spaces  in  neoliberal  times  (Leccardi  2009),  people  continue  to  join  spaces  in  their 
everyday lives, and this influences the construction of their self and their networks. Places are always 
gendered, in the sense that perceptions and feelings prompting from spaces depend on the social 
structures and the subjects’ potential for agency. Perceptions related to spaces are socially produced, 
and people receive and re-elaborate these perceptions depending on their socialisation, tools, and 
interpretation (Ahmed 2004). FSs draw on this standpoint, and they seek to arrange physical spaces 
that enable new structures of feelings to emerge.  
Carefully arranged spaces encourage pleasant emotional reactions. As the Roestone collective states, 
safer  spaces  are  contextually  embedded,  and  “we  might  understand  them  as  the  opposite  of  the 
etymological utopia—rather than being ‘placeless’, they are very much products of particular places 
and situations” (Roestone Collective 2014: 1349). It is not just a setting for meetings or events but 
also a comfort-zone, an infra-time in the metropolis’s flux. The positive feelings that come from a 
physical space encourage self-expression and political reasoning, as one CS interviewee explains: “I 
feel very comfortable, [...] which means that I can quietly take the floor, I can also shut up and say 
nothing if I don't feel like it” (IIIR7, CS, 30). As much as the setting is carefully arranged, people 
reverberate that care with feelings of pleasure and well-being. The physical structure also affects 

158 
 
people coming for events or meetings, as a LYS interviewee tells: “I think it's [...] a question of the 
physical structure of the place. [...] Having the garden... people feel that it is a beautiful place. [...] 
The fact that there are spaces that are welcoming, [...] you can smell and taste the house when you 
enter” (IIR5, LYS, 33). It is not by chance that the interviewee refers to bodily sensations (smelling, 
tasting) to express a cognitive process (feeling good in a welcoming place). This link makes explicit 
the function of affects as a mediation between cognition and body, and as a channel of interpretation 
of the stimuli coming from other people, spaces, and objects. Awareness of this nexus also helps to 
modulate relationships with others through the care of the physical elements of space. Since one of 
the goals of political action is to broaden the circle of diffusion of political claims, positive emotions 
coming from the physical structure play a role in attracting people and broadening the scope of 
collective action.  
Spaces enhance positive emotions for people that are often feeling “out of place.” Positive affects 
“expand” the self (Natoli 2003), and allow people to connect the self with the social dimension, the 
connection  of  which  is  often  fragmented  due  to  the  gender  and  inequality regime.  As  one  CS 
interviewee makes clear, when in the FS “I can be myself. [...]  I am really going to live” (IIIR9, CS, 
35). Affects mediate the possibility of developing a sense of one’s self and one's place in the social 
world.  When  these  affects  are  positive,  they  consolidate  the  elaboration  process  and  convey  the 
feeling of “being able to really live.” Participants feel like they are growing and developing their self, 
and this strength change their life path, as a CS participant explains: “the feelings are of well-being... 
of a space that really fills my life with all its difficulties... it fills my life every day but fills my 
character, my reasoning, it makes me grow, it allows me to do a lot of things” (IIIR7, CS, 30). This 
degree of intensity and vital force signals the expansion of the self, of its capacity for action, of its 
transformative potential towards the social world.  
I  mentioned  earlier  the  fragmentation  between  the  self  and  the  social  dimension.  More  or  less 
profound obstacles stand in the way of the development of a coherent social self. These obstacles are 
perceived through the mediation of affects, and are processed and dealt with through affects.  
A CS participant elaborates on the idea of affects as a mediation between the individual consequences 
and collective action as follows: “we are kept together by anger” (IIIR7, CS, 30). Anger comes from 
daily life, from a gendered setting where being a woman, a lesbian, a trans or non-binary person 
exposes them to increasing levels of violence or harassment. Affects, such as anger, allow one to 
develop political elaboration, and thus an understanding of the social condition and the structures that 
cause  it.  Through  a  synecdoche,  men  are  considered  as  the  expression  of  masculinity,  as  the 
organising principle of the social world, and therefore also of the phenomenon of violence. Men are 
taken into account as the symbol of a social order based on gender inequality. As a consequence, their 

159 
 
absence from a social, and not biological, point of view contributes to the perception of safety and 
well-being. As a LYS participant argues, “perhaps it is a strong word, but this hatred of men here has 
found not an outlet, but a rest. I didn't have men around here. [...] and so maybe in a very personal 
formulation for me this place was safe for that” (IIR2, LYS, 37). Often, this feeling depends on a very 
simple action: the possibility or not to express love or erotic attraction for another person in the public 
space, clothes, attitude. “[In the FS] I can kiss anyone and I certainly have a different peace of mind 
than I do outside. I don't necessarily have to take care of where I am” (IIIR5, CS, 30). Comfort arises 
from the possibility to fully express one’s body, the interaction between bodies and emotions. In this 
sense, affects act as a mediation between the body and the social dimension, but they also change the 
bodies’ potential for action.  
Affects not only mediate the relationship between the self and the social dimension, but are also the 
subjects  of  political elaboration  and  the  construction  of  collective  action.  The  more  practices  of 
organisations are respectful of participants, the more activists will take pleasure in political action. 
Pleasure and well-being are taking into account in the choice of decision-making process, strategies, 
and tactics. The following quote by a CS interviewee shows the connection made by FSs between 
practices of organisation, affects, tactics and goals: 
The difference is that in our space there is no hierarchy. And if there is, or if anyone ever sees it, 
it  could  be  immediately  questioned.  Of  course  you  can  stop  everything  if  there  is  something 
wrong. [...] If someone is not well, if someone feels uncomfortable, if something is not working 
or if... you stop. [...] It has never happened: we must do this, we must do that. No. (IIIR4, CS, 
30) 
 
Nothing comes before the creation of consistent structures of feelings. By dismantling the neoliberal 
idea of time and productivity, FSs pursue the effectiveness of political action out of emotions. Goals 
and strategies are taken through consent. In the name of collective comfort only widely accepted 
purpose are pursued, and this is, in itself, a source of comfort for participants. This choice of engaging 
with well-being and the pursuit of collective happiness comes from the awareness that positive affects 
increase the potential for action. Negative emotions, such as frustration, suspicion, distrust, let people 
drop  out  or  become  less  active  in  the  collective  action.  On  the  contrary,  well-being,  transparent 
communication, and mutual trust prepare the ground for effective strategies, tactics, and repertoire of 
action. As such, we can argue about positive affect as the ground for social movements’ capacity for 
social change. This mechanism is not without a dark side. The construction of consistent structures 
of feelings takes time, is slow and laborious. As much as it produces positive affects, it can degenerate 
into a feeling of ineffectiveness, frustration, and dissatisfaction. In this sense, the research argues that 
the construction of safer spaces is a process, in which affects are not positive or negative per se, but 
are invested with meaning by the relational dynamics and the cognitive/corporeal process of each 

160 
 
participant. 
As Belingardi and Castelli argue, in FSs there exists “a security of closeness and relationships, [...] 
a safety of community” (2015: 221). The creation of structures of feelings is related to the creation 
of community ties, where affects can circulate, can be elaborated on and changed. A conversation 
with a CS participant sheds light on “the circle,” a geometric figure in which to place oneself, but 
also a political and thinking arrangement in the FSs: “she tells me that for her the difference of politics 
between women, is that women live the circle. Another social form, very different. Because the circle 
has no edges, there are no shadow zones. When women put themselves in a circle, or in an assembly, 
it is not only for horizontality. It is also because no one is behind, no one can attack you, they all look 
at each other’s faces. I ask her why she thinks that men are afraid of the circle and she tells me that it 
is because men always move in a hierarchical manner. There are leaders, there are wingmen. We have 
learned this from them, they do not move in a circle. Women manage to have different dimensions 
of horizontality. [...] She tells me that if you pay attention it always happens, even during parties, 
that women find themselves in a circle [...]. You create a circle, because of how you deal with the 
elements of dissonance. This also happens to feminist marches, you feel that way, as if everything is 
possible. It is not necessarily a physical circle, but more a feeling, that envelops you, that you feel 
like in an embrace. Because it is as if something that you are used to all the time, to judge people, to 
judge women by the choices they make, as if the whole thing goes out. And instead other things 
happen,  you  see  women,  you  see  them  shine”  (Fieldnotes,  CS,  24-05-19).  The  circle  relates  to 
physical, emotional, and political dimensions. On one hand, it is a way in which participants tend to 
position themselves, both during assemblies and in public protests. On the other, it is an intangible 
feeling, the perception of being surrounded by a circle of affect, support, and strength from the other 
participants. The feeling of security is produced through the practice of standing in a circle. In this 
physical form, affective consequences occur: one looks at each other, one perceives the others, one 
can see everyone. This physical and affective form is also political: decisions are made in a circle, 
moments of public protest call for a circle.  
The figuration of the circle increases the power of the group, which is more than the sum of the 
individual participants. As Natoli (2003) argues the meaning of the Greek and Latin root of the word 
“joy” recalls that of “shine, brightness.” In the following paragraphs, I will focus on the positive 
affects triggered by the relationship with others, on the energy that is released in the encounter. As 
pointed out in the quotation, interaction in the circle (often) produces joy, and in this sense, even in 
philological terms, one seems to see people shining. The historical “discover” of women-to-women 
relationships as a ground for collective action allowed marginalised subjects (such as women, trans, 
and non-binary people) to claim their capacity for social change. Standing one next to the other is a 

161 
 
channel  through  which  fear,  loneliness,  and  discomfort  are  challenged.  Affective  flows  produce 
networks and the shape of spaces. Participants live day by day a FS where they find friends, comrades, 
and sisters. With them they talk about bad experiences, find care, support, and comprehension. This 
awareness of referring to a space where people care about you progressively works at the formation 
of an inner strength. Some participants of CS claim a provocative imaginary of “the pack.” “The 
pack”  is  a  conventional  word  for  male  groups  acting  violence  against  women.  Through  the 
reappropriation of this word, participants are meant to reclaim their capacity to create a group among 
women, that expresses strength and eventually self-defence:  
For the women, the pack is a frightening imaginary, it is a bit of a bogeyman [...], against which 
we are not able to defend ourselves. And instead the pack... is the pack of your sisters. [...] 
Something that makes you feel safe [...]. The point is if you move together for the protection of 
yourself or if you move together for the aggression of another person. (IIIR6, CS, 35) 
 
The imagery of the sisters’ pack allows for a sense of heightened power, however much violence may 
occur in individual lives. The feeling of being surrounded by a pack becomes "a weapon [...] both 
defensive  and  attacking."  The  awareness  of  managing  together  problematic  situations  allows 
participants  to  feel  safer,  despite  the  things  that  can  happen.  Participants  face  violence  through 
participation and manage physical threats or discomfort together. It is a tool that allows them not to 
be helpless in the face of individual experiences of inequality. Even with respect to street violence, if 
experienced alone, it can be addressed with a collective reaction.  
According to the neoliberal order, people are used to think only about themselves, to care only about 
their own business, and to maximise their productivity on an individual basis. Instead, FSs claim that 
through emotional ties is it possible to maximise individual growth, develop tools for autonomy, and 
transform social structures of inequality. Everyone should look after the others, be ready to face 
situations of potential risk or threat, intervene when women are living discomfort or expressing a 
need. This is a way of managing FSs that goes from moments of assembly to playful evenings.  
Hence, becoming safer is a process through which the potential for collective action increases. It 
depends on a capacity to react to emotional charges. As a LYS interviewee claims, “In my opinion, 
what I call safe is the ability to react. In front of a real physical danger, in front of a malaise, in front 
of the moment in which one is less visible” (IIR7, LYS, 35). This disposition is not a humanitarian 
love for others, but a praxis of relations which comes from responsibility. As much as care and 
affection are the basis for relations, so is mutual accountability. By rejoicing in the joy of others, and 
following each other’s paths, participants engage with the collective work on emotions, and emotions 
become political.  
In spite of this relative openness, critiques to the higher or lower degree of accessibility remain. Some 
of the activists acknowledge that this perception of closeness is consequent to the need to protect the 

162 
 
space from external threats, as CS interviewee develops: “I think this is normal, that it happens in all 
occupied social spaces. [...] That is to have a baggage, a ballast, to have a sharing, a love, a hate, a 
passion... which is not easy to share right away, so in my opinion this story of welcoming you is a 
big bullshit” (IIIR4, CS, 30). Affects can also be boundaries, that tie a certain community together 
and make the space less accessible for others. Sometimes, if some specific people feel discomfort this 
is positively welcomed. Safety and comfort depend on power and privileges, so some people feel 
discomfort when their privileges are unveiled. In FSs, this discomfort is a positive part of a changing 
system where others, usually excluded or permanently uneasy, are aiming at producing their own 
space of liveability (Arao e Clemens 2013). Some participants complain about this accusation, since 
women are always required to be more welcoming and more caring, as a CID interviewee argues: “in 
the end, this is what is expected of women, that they always know how to welcome you. That they 
always make this presence together, of sisterhood, of maternity” (IR5, CID, 73).  
The possibility to express emotions (anger, fear, passion, frustration, love, and so on) is a way to learn 
to manage emotions. Indeed, a safe space where nothing happens and everyone is kind to the others 
does not exist. On the contrary, harsh discussion, conflict, and relational fractures are always present. 
The difference is that most of the times these rifts can be questioned, and the community works in 
the direction of new tools of interaction. This section aims at addressing the functions affects play in 
FSs:  first,  as  channel  of  mediation  between  cognition  and  bodies;  second,  as  tool  for  political 
elaboration;  third,  as  competence  in  action.  As  the  analysis  shows,  positive  affects  enhance  the 
potential for the self and collective actors to act, and this increase of vital forces coalesces collective 
action. But how to preserve the process of creating structures of feelings? 
 
6.3.3 Caring spaces  
 
To preserve structures of feelings, FSs elaborate on the ethics of care. The work on affects reveals 
the dark side of politics and of human beings, and requires an ongoing practice of preserving people 
and  communities.  According  to  its  prefigurative  aims,  the  ethics  of  care  is  consistent  with  an 
understanding of social ties, as a whole, even beyond FSs. No one can be a fully autonomous atom: 
everyone depends on the others in a mutual net. As a LYS interviewee states with regard to care: “we 
all need it” (IIR4, LYS, 53). How to bridge the need to give and receive care with the feminist path 
of self-determination and liberation?  How to make the ethics of care into effective collective action? 
As the following quote shows, care in FSs concerns communities and collective settings, beyond 
family and couples. By debunking the notion of women as caregivers and care as a social obligation 

163 
 
taken on by women, FSs develop new understandings of care that can serve as a proxy for social 
interactions beyond FSs:  
Getting rid of this vector of oppression, however, does not mean eliminating any form of care. In 
my opinion, this element within Cagne has been an element that, [...] has materialised in practice, 
in the sense that carrying out a space, keeping it occupied, paying attention to the dynamics that 
are  created  at  the  assembly  level,  in  the  management  of  everyday  life,  in  the  distribution  of 
responsibility, is a work of care. It is a work of care that you direct not so much to your personal 
satisfaction or to your relationship as a couple, or to your nuclear family, but you extend it to a 
wide and common community. (IIIR10, CS, 30) 
 
FSs  develop  a  political  understanding  of  care:  to  take  care  of  somebody  and  something  means 
questioning family, the coupledom, and the material dimension of politics. It regards organisation 
settings, internal dynamics, decision-making processes, and every-day life. Politics is not only about 
statements and discourses, but it regards everyday interactions and the emotional field. As one CS 
participant explains, the ethics of care broadens the very idea of politics to include the affective 
dimension of people, which is also part of their willingness or unwillingness for collective action: 
“we realised that we couldn't just talk about political practices or things we wanted to do. [...] If 
people fall around you, it's not that you can pass over them. So we don't only talk about big problems... 
because the staff is political” (IIIR4, CS, 30).  
The  awareness  about  positive  affects  producing  expansive  effects,  makes  FSs  receptive  to  the 
emotional  states  of  participants.  The  ethics  of  care  requires  taking  care  of  people  dealing  with 
personal problems or moments of bewilderment. As a CS participant argues about herself, “there are 
very high standards of care practices. [...] In various moments, among other things also in moments 
that directly affected me, that I was very sad, very weak, very borderline” (IIIR5, CS, 30). The daily 
life of the space and its political activity are constructed following the rhythm of the affections, 
through  mutual  attention  to  moods  and  emotional  conditions.  This  attention  is  consequent  to  an 
awareness of the impact of affects on collective action, and a willingness to challenge the neoliberal 
laws of efficiency and productivity, as a LYS interviewee explains with regard to a comrade: “how 
comfortable she is, how in a period of time we feel that she has lost energy or enthusiasm, or put them 
aside... this is an attention that is very present between us.” (IIR8, LYS, 30). Paying attention to how 
people feel, how they change over time, is also a way of preserving the continuity of the political 
space and its effectiveness. This way of taking care of each other materially changes spaces. Political 
spaces become more liveable. The greater or lesser availability for political participation depends on 
the ethics of care. For instance, sometimes people get more active in order to allow the other to take 
their time to rest, as a LYS interviewee explains: “you realise that you don't want them [the comrades] 
to do some things on their own and that's it. [...]. I think it's one of the things that happens most to 

164 
 
me inside Lucha, to know that, okay she's sick so I want to be there, the other one is tired, so if I can 
I’ll be there” (IIR5, LYS, 33). 
To take care of physical spaces is part of the ethics of care. Cleaning, tidying up, fixing broken things, 
drawing materials, all these tasks are a way to express mutual responsibility, since the space is the 
mirror of a collective actor. A LYS interviewee clarifies: “the more we take care of all these nuances 
the more we feel good in here, the more people who come here feel that sense of care and serenity 
and respect for the place you have, and the more it all works somehow” (IIR7, LYS, 35). An ethics 
of care preserves the structure of feelings of FSs. People are involved in a reciprocal effort to make 
the FS welcoming. This attention produces the shift from an external security to an internal security 
built in the reciprocity of care, as a LYS interviewee shows: “make each one responsible for that 
space. I am not a policeman, I am not there to check the documents of those who enter, but I am 
careful, because I feel responsible in some way, of women and children, but also of my comrades, 
but also of me. And being responsible for me also means doing something for others.” (IIR5, LYS, 
33).  
The issue is specifically relevant for those spaces that offer services and reception to women in need. 
Spaces try to be welcoming from a physical point of view: clear communication about location, safe 
environment  (which  often  means  the  absence  of  men),  accessible  paths  and  rooms.  Participants 
engage with the fight against gender-based violence, and they help women finding new dimension of 
recovery,  comfort,  and  safety. They  claim  for  a  broader  understanding  of  safety,  that  includes 
networking with other women, economic autonomy, a house, as the fieldnotes from LYS case show: 
“Moira tells me that until they are sure that [the women hosted] have a house and a job they don't let 
them out. She says ‘we have to be sure that they are safe’" (Fieldnotes, LYS, 11-06-09).  
FSs are often based on a deal, an implicit or explicit agreement among activists and women. In order 
to produce a safer setting, the community needs grounding rules and shared foundations. An example 
from LYS accounts for the need for a deal: every two years the people making up the community of 
the space – activists and women hosted at the centre – write together a regulation, with a series of 
recommendations. How to manage the space, which type of assemblies to carry out, which duties. 
These rules change every two years depending on the FS composition, but they are needed in order 
to enjoy the space. Everyone is free but has to adhere to a shared deal, and if someone transgresses 
the community talks about how and why. This ongoing process of working on internal dynamics is 
typical of all FSs, that do not defer to pre-existing models. With regard to LYS, there where thousands 
of moments in which women passed through offering a coffee, a chat, something to eat. This warm 
environment was reproduced by all the people there, and it included whoever was spending time 
there, despite their collocation and role.  

165 
 
The ethics of care is part of the management of playful events, where FSs are open to outsiders. These 
moments  might  be  risky  or  even  dangerous.  Political  rituals  of  care  are  translated  into  ways  of 
interactions with the outside: things can happen, but they are differently managed, and this allows 
people to feel safer. As CS interviewee puts it: 
Another step is: I decide to make a soirée at the space. How does my political discourse and my 
speech of collective self-consciousness turn into a sociality? What is a safe space? A space where 
nothing ever happens? I don't think so. [...] I think that a safe space is not a space where things 
don't happen, but a space where there is a collective readiness to take care of a situation that is 
created, of the people that are involved. And they are revolutionary processes of change at the 
basis of relationships. (IIIR3, CS, 30) 
 
Guaranteeing a totally safe space is not feasible. For this reason, producing the space is a relational 
process involving all persons taking part in the situation within the space. If affects and emotions are 
not  predictable  and  cannot  be  oriented  in  advance,  the  care  structure  within  which  the  work  on 
emotions takes place can be solid. 
Yet, some participants complain about a too high attention regarding care, that sometimes blocks the 
collective process of reasoning and acting: “hyper-sensitivity and hyper-care at times, I don't know if 
it's  a  limit,  but  sometimes  I  think  it  paralyses  us  somehow”  (IIIR5,  CS,  30).  Because  people 
acknowledge FSs as “care-givers,” sometimes the expression of individual difficulties prevails over 
collective goals. The neoliberal system, based on individualism, prevents people to care about the 
collective, and it involuntary traps FSs in the same logic, as fieldnotes from the focus group at CS 
show:  
The concept of care compared to a request is something that I think has plagued this place so 
much. Many people come in here looking for an answer [...]. The welcoming dynamic is not a 
group  that  welcomes  a  single  person  but  a  relationship  of  mutual  exchange  [...].  But  in  the 
individualistic spirit in which we are raised in this system, where what is important is your best 
friend, your boyfriend, your family, it is difficult. (Focus Group transcription IIIRA, Rome, 10-
07-19) 
 
The  ethics  of  care  requires  work  to  dismantle  neoliberal  individualism  in  favour  of  a  sense  of 
community. Individuals are socialised into building a certain kind of social network: their partner, 
the  nuclear  family,  their  parents,  their  children.  Only  the  closest  relationships,  especially  blood 
relations, or romantic bonds, are of value. Community, on the other hand, is a virtually non-existent 
concept. Learning to live in a community and to care for it, beyond the closest ties, requires a work 
on oneself that is also a work of contestation against the forms of socialisation that are taken for 
granted. 
In the section, I went through the creation of an ethics of care to preserve structures of feelings. This 
ethics of care takes place with regard to physical arrangements, interaction among participants and 

166 
 
outsiders, and rules of the game. Ethics of care is a cognitive and bodily practice that materialises the 
FSs awareness on the role, the use, and the consequences of collective affects.  
 
6.4 Producing Structures of Feelings: a Summary  
 
In this section, I engaged with the work on affects and emotions within FSs at the level of community, 
spaces and actors. Results are built upon Williams’ definition of structures of feelings (1954, 1969), 
as the inner dynamic that allows alternative ways of thinking to emerge, within the dominant way of 
thinking. With way of thinking, he takes into account an assemblage of affects, rationality, frames, 
and ideas. According to this interpretation, I explored the FSs’ effort to build alternative structures of 
feelings, through several dimensions. First, through the physical dimension, and the choice to identify 
a place, and transform its characteristics in view of political goals. The way in which this relationship 
with the physical role takes place is mediated by and produces a series of affects. Within a dominant 
paradigm, the choice to manage a physical place represents a strategy to challenge the economic and 
institutional model of city management. Managing a physical place, in which affects circulate, also 
requires an organisational choice. Through the exploration of the organisational choices of the three 
spaces, I have tried to highlight how decision-making processes and organisational forms produce 
different structures of feelings and a different effectiveness in collective action. A certain degree of 
formalisation, combined with openness to innovation, allows positive feelings to be consolidated and 
negative ones to be limited.  
But what do I mean when I refer to structures of feelings? To investigate how the analysis through 
CGTM led me to this concept, I went through the way in which affects are mobilised for collective 
action. The research began with the question: how do feminist movements imagine, produce, and 
preserve safer spaces? In the course of the analysis, the question of safety turned out to be the most 
obvious manifestation, the tip of the iceberg of a much deeper and more structural work on affects. It 
is precisely the taking charge of affect and emotions, their collective elaboration and transformation 
that construct the infrastructure of meaning within which people perceive themselves to be safer, i.e. 
by  coming  into  contact  with  their  own  emotional  sphere.  The  capitalist  economic  model,  as 
Hirschman (1977) explains, was built from the Renaissance onwards through a clear division between 
the  passions  (affect,  emotions,  feelings)  and  interests.  This  split  seemed  necessary  to  ensure  a 
flourishing development of trade and the emerging economic model on the one hand, and to limit the 
power of rulers on the other. However, this split has consolidated over time, supporting the symbolic 
production of a rational social actor driven by self-interest, inspired by the logic of profit, able to 
maximise productivity and above all to confine and manage (in private, away from the public sphere) 
their emotions. In this infrastructure of meaning, which as Williams (1954) explains is a dominant 

167 
 
way of thinking, normative models of individual behaviour have proliferated. The establishment of 
this normative model has produced a growing sense of disorientation, alienation (as defined by Marx 
(1858), anxiety, and frustration arising from economic productivity, but also from the subordinate 
confinement  of  emotions.  The  consequences  have  been  exacerbated  over  the  years  by  further 
developments  in  the  model – such  as  globalisation,  changes  in  the  job  market,  and  the  gradual 
disappearance of welfare states. Rational social actors have become more and more precarious lives 
(Butler 2006), driven to be self-made men, to maximise profits even in the face of a job market and 
an institutional set-up that constantly produces individualism, competition, and failure. The feelings 
arising from the economic model concern the splitting of the emotional sphere from the development 
of the self in the public sphere and politics. In this sense, the intuition of 1970s feminism to investigate 
the political through the personal – the intimate, the private, the domestic – represented a way to 
reunite dichotomies, to reposition the subject in the social context, and to unveil constrictive symbolic 
and economic structures. The feminist political proposal intended to look at affect as a vital impulse 
until then silenced, misunderstood, dismissed. Women, historically associated with the emotional 
sphere, were the ones making this proposal. Women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people had 
experienced that side of the dichotomy, the association between the feminine, emotions, weakness, 
the private, madness, nature. Drawing on the dark side of the dichotomy, in which they had been 
socialised as subaltern subjects, feminists try to restore meaning to emotions as a matrix of collective 
action. In this sense, the response to structure – to the economic model, to institutions, to public 
policies – is  the  creation  of  alternative  structures  of  feelings  that  make  the  work  on  affects  and 
emotions their frame of meaning. In order to understand how the work on affects occurs, I have 
explored them as 1) a mediation between cognition and body, 2) a tool for political elaboration, 3) a 
competence in action. In this triple function, there emerged the potential of affects for individual and 
collective transformation. Positive affects (that are not only joy, happiness, etc., but all those affects 
that increase the power of life, including anger) allow the self – of the subject and the community – 
to expand, to experience its potential for action in the world. For this reason, FSs direct their actions 
to stimulate positive affects, their circulation, in order to feed this process of continuous development 
of potential. To preserve this process, FSs engage with an ethic of care, that creates the symbolic and 
material network of solidarity within which the work on affects and emotions can be carried out.  
The results that emerged from the analysis seem to demonstrate, on the one hand, that the work on 
emotions represents a challenge to the historical process of consolidation of the neoliberal rationality, 
and on the other, that it opens up a field of possibilities for subjects and collective actors with respect 
to their own agency. In this chapter, I explored the construction of FSs as structures of feelings 
through potentials of affects, and thus the way emotions enter collective action modifying its margins, 

168 
 
its contents, and its orientation. In the next chapter, I will explore how affects and emotions are 
transformed into collective action.   
 
  

169 
 
7. Transforming Affects into Action 
 
 
7.1 Introduction  
 
In the previous chapter, I looked at FSs as structures of feelings. Affects emerged as 1) a channel of 
mediation between cognition and body, 2) a tool for political elaboration, and 3) a competence in 
action. In this chapter, I will go through the third mechanism. How are affects made into action? How 
are they mobilised for collective action? To do so, I will look at affects in time and space and then at 
the repertoire of action developed by FSs.  
 
Changing Temporalities  
Affects, as gradients of intensities and vital forces, continuously produce meanings, spaces, networks 
among participants and constitute a ground for action. By working on affects, participants learn words 
and tools to deal with the social dimension, through cognition and body. This understanding brings 
them to question the use of affects. As much as they have an adaptive role (they develop to let people 
survive), they can have a use to target or change social dynamics. What moves and affects us provides 
important information about the context, about our needs, about what makes us feel good or bad. 
Learning to recognise the gradients of intensity that move us allows us to modify the way we act, to 
strengthen it.  
Among the things that most influence the way we act are time and space. The social perception of 
time drives individuals to choose certain learning paths over others, to set their reproductive and non-
reproductive choices, but it also influences everyday life. We relate to time through the mediation of 
affects. Since time is not natural, it is continuously produced by our way of codifying it, of giving it 
meaning.  A  perception  of  time  informed  by  affects,  and  therefore  by a cognitive  and  bodily 
"compass," allows us to construct other meanings in relation to it. The dimension of time emerged 
significantly from the empirical analysis as a space for transformative action. 
Scholars working on sociology and time highlight changes of the understanding of time fostered by 
the capitalist mode of production (Durkheim 1965, Elias 1986, Giddens 1994, Leccardi 2009). The 
changing times of work, everyday life, and productivity have increased the tendency towards social 
acceleration and a de-timed present. Individuals have to negotiate with social, economic, and political 
time, with regard to their inner perception of time and life-course paths. FSs engage with time through 
the medium of affects. Time ceases to be given, and it becomes a field of resistance and reworking. 

170 
 
On one hand, FSs enhance counter-times at the micro-structural level of individuals. On the other, 
they do so at the meso-level of space and community.  
 
Changing Spaces 
Affects mediate our understanding and use of time, but also of space. Very often during the fieldwork 
I  found  the  equation,  reported  by  participants,  between  home  and  political  space.  Why  is  the 
association between home and political space striking?  
The Western tradition of thought separates private spaces from public spaces (Fraser 1990). This 
separation allows to keep the division of social functions, roles, and expectations. The private home 
is the context of intimate relations, the family, sexuality, but also violence: elements that should be 
relegated away from the public eye. Private space “naturally” belongs to women, as well as the field 
of emotions, of care, of vulnerability (Stanko 1988). Public space, instead, is the place of deliberation, 
work, conflict, protests, institutions, and more generally politics. It is a male sphere. The 1970s 
Western feminist movements questioned the role of women in the private space. To go outside of the 
home  was  considered  as  a  source  of  empowerment.  Black  feminists  challenged  this  Eurocentric 
vision, claiming “home as site of resistance” (hooks 1991) for Black women under slavery and in 
contemporary times of racism and white supremacy. Home is the site of community bounds, of care, 
warmth, and solidarity. Women at home are the core of community structure, and they foster the 
dignity that is missing in the outside world. Since the period of colonial plantations in the South of 
the US, women were relegated to the house, and to a specific room: the kitchen. Despite the condition 
of exploitation and violence, in the kitchens women were also able to elaborate strategies of resistance 
and well-being. For instance, they fed their male companions, they took care of the whole Black 
community, they stayed among each other and supported each other (hooks 1991, Davis 1999). Other 
trajectories of life and survival were made possible because of women’s interaction within the space 
of the kitchen. Kitchens are part of the symbolic and material place that recurs in the association with 
FSs. As Scicluna argues, “the home is an entanglement of powers that flow through the main spheres 
of life—social, cultural, economic and political. It is a place of paradoxes and negotiations. [...] This 
polyvalent characteristic of the home makes it an ideal terrain to understand the way social and 
political forces are negotiated at ground level” (2017: 10).  
Drawing on this theoretical framework, I will question the role of home, kitchens, and food in FSs. 
The  mediation  of  affects  breaks  with  the  dichotomies  of  public/private,  weak/strong, 
rational/emotional.  Through  the  informed  knowledge  of  the  intensity  gradients  that  move  their 
actions, participants become able to transform the meanings attributed to spaces, and therefore the 
action that takes place within those spaces. It is not by chance that the association with the home is 

171 
 
so recurrent: the discovery of the sphere of emotions as a source of understanding and empowerment 
of the collective self allows political space to be experienced also as an intimate, domestic, personal 
space.  In  this  way,  the  potential  of  space,  no  longer  purely  public  and  political,  is  transformed. 
Transformed  by  affects,  it  provides  participants  with  the  opportunity  to  explore  new  ways  of 
developing ties, producing knowledge, and designing political action.   
 
Transforming Affects into Action 
To explore how affects are transformed into action, I will look at the repertoire of action, knowledge 
and codes, and direct social action.  
According to Taylor and van Dyke, protests are “sites of contestation in which bodies, symbols, 
identities, practices, and discourses are used to pursue or prevent changes in institutionalized power 
relations” (2004: 268). Women’s movements have frequently been in the spotlight of research on the 
repertoire of actions because of their disruptive and unorthodox use of bodies and strategies in order 
to pursue their goals (Staggenborg 1989, Taylor and Rupp 1993, Taylor and Whittier 1995, Taylor 
1996). “Researchers of the women’s movement have added greatly to our understanding of the way 
movements combine tactics oriented to political and personal change by demonstrating how feminist 
movements meld mass demonstrations and other forms of direct action with consciousness-raising, 
self-help,  and  embodied  forms  of  resistance  to  critique  and  transgress  dominant  conceptions  of 
heterosexualized  femininity”  (Taylor  and  Van  Dyke  2004:  264).  In  the  course  of  the  empirical 
analysis, I was able to observe that the understanding of affects and emotions not only created a 
certain structure of meaning, but that collective action was also transformed by it. Instead of taking 
place on a purely strategic level, political elaboration and its translation into practical action also took 
place on another level. Informed knowledge of the affects allows participants to assess what issues to 
address, how to question them, and what forms of direct intervention can be used to change them. 
This  affect-mediated  approach  makes  it  possible  to  develop  forms  of  action that  broaden  the 
conventional movement’s repertoire (Tilly 1986). Here I do not intend to investigate whether this 
translates into a greater or lesser effectiveness. Instead, I intend to focus on how the transformation 
of the potential of collective action leads to innovative strategies, sometimes with unexpected results.  
An informed understanding of affect influences both repertoires of action and the production of codes 
and knowledge. As della Porta and Pavan outline, “contemporary progressive social movements form 
collective  spaces  of  knowledge  production  that  are  true  laboratories  for  innovation”  (2017:  1). 
Movements aim at producing alternative epistemologies oriented to challenge the status quo. Echoing 
Tilly’s definition of repertoire of contention (1986), della Porta and Pavan shed light on the repertoire 
of knowledge practices (2017).  

172 
 
Since the 1970s, feminist movements engaged with the production of counter-knowledge. The male-
based culture and science were considered as inherently oppressive and exclusionary. At that time, 
women broadened the notion of health, both in terms of knowledge on their own bodies and medical 
knowledge; in the production of women’s narratives, literature, history, science; in the opening of 
gender and feminist studies courses within academia. They developed a whole set of knowledge 
through which they negotiated the relation with institutions in order to improve legal and social 
conditions. Since then, the production of knowledge has taken place through a situated analysis of 
reality. Starting from oneself meant putting one's own personal at the service of a collective reflection 
on cultural paradigms of reference, on the symbolic order, on codes. The elaboration of the FSs draws 
on this genealogy. Why should affects lead to a different knowledge and what use is this knowledge? 
Still with reference to Hirschman's studies on the birth of capitalism, it is evident how much the 
separation of passions and interests has produced in terms of the symbolic order. This challenge of 
rethinking  the  world  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  emotions,  therefore,  is situated  in  a  broader 
perspective of questioning the economic model, institutions and social structures. 
Finally, all the spaces taken into account deal with forms of direct social action. Each of them adopts 
different strategies and tactics. As Melucci outlines, “non institutional practices thus contribute to 
changes  not  only  or  mainly  by  what  they  offer,  but  even  more  by  the  alternatives  they  help  us 
imagine” (1989: 141). Bosi and Zamponi define direct social action as “forms of action that focus 
upon directly transforming some specific aspects of society by means of the very action itself, instead 
of claiming something from the state or other power holders.” (2015: 367). Included in these forms 
of action are those that “ignore or circumvent the traditional state-addressing repertoires of action, 
and that focus instead on a 'self-changing' society as part of everyday politics, in which the distinction 
between  the  public  and  private  spheres  is  blurred”  (2015:  368-369),  such  as  occupations,  self-
managed centres, anti-violence shelters, free legal advice, psychological support, work orientation, 
collective purchasing groups, crowdfunding, health clinics. From an historical point of view, the 
women’s movement in Italy has always dealt with direct intervention in the social field. Through 
consciousness rising, feminist groups harvested needs and inequalities, and invented strategic action 
aimed at changing social inequalities. In that direction goes the opening of health clinics (consultori 
autogestiti) for women’s health and illegal abortions; of women’s houses; of the first anti-violence 
shelters  (the  first  in  Rome  was  created  in  1977,  within  the  feminist  occupation  of  the  Governo 
Vecchio building). How is direct action currently pursued by FSs? How does the work on affects 
shape goals and trajectories of these types of action? 

173 
 
In this section,  I  will  keep  the  focus  on  affects  and  emotions  as  channels  for  understanding  the 
innovation on collective action brought about by the FSs, but also for understanding their limitations 
and constraints. 
 
7.2 Affect in Time and Space  
 
 
7.2.1 The Feminist Time: Changing Temporalities   
 
One of the forces that allowed Lucha to grow and become a point of reference in the city was that of not 
chasing others, something that came to us a lot from mixed movements. [...] But to have our own way. We set 
goals for ourselves, [...] and to pursue those goals, despite the things that came your way... it happens that 
you have to write that document within ten minutes because otherwise it won't work tomorrow... Fuck you! 
(emphatic). I have more to do. Because in my opinion that is an instrument of power. To make you stay in their 
time. So you don't have your time to reflect and put it into practice. Because you have to go after them. [...] 
We structured our own thinking, our own methodology, and we went on our way. This has been... and is and 
continues to be a great strength for Lucha. And this in my opinion is characteristic of feminism. (IIR6, LYS, 
45) 
 
Time, as well as space, is a social product. As the quote shows, FSs aim to challenge both the time of 
social movements and neoliberal time. To question time allows to challenge the issue of power, in 
order to change social structures of inequalities. The awareness of time – as a social product, as a 
compulsion, as an induction to action – is consequent to the mediation of affects. The feeling of 
frustration, of dissatisfaction, of chasing, of constriction, pushes participants to question whether the 
time experienced is consistent with the collective will, or rather dysfunctional. From the mediation 
of affects comes the identification of different needs, and therefore the choice to construct another 
temporality. This form of collective action on time, informed by affects, does not produce a decrease 
in the capacity for collective action – that is, a slowdown, an ineffectiveness, a weakening – but rather 
enhances the capacity for collective action. In this sense, the interviewee claims that this form of 
collective action on time is "a great strength."  
In this section, I will take into account feminist practices of time management, oriented to challenge 
the conventional understanding of time. In the first part, I will go through the change of the individual 
perception of time thanks to participation in FSs. In the second part, I will look at the meso level of 
collective action, and how time changes through the mediation of affects.  
At the micro-level of individuals, political participation in FSs enhances a negotiation between their 
inner  perception  of time  and  their  life-course  path.  By  taking  part in FSs,  their  expected  life 
achievements, steps, and procedures come to be challenged. Becoming feminist and engaging in a 
feminist space changes the time of every-day life. A LYS interviewee claims that the FS “became a 

174 
 
bit of a part of my life. [...]  I went to university and stayed here [at LYS] in the afternoon. [...] So it 
also changed my way of managing time so much” (IIR8, LYS, 30). The choice to dedicate time to 
the FS puts into question the time dedicated to other interactions, such as romantic relationships and 
friendships external to FSs. FSs blur the boundaries between the private and public dimensions, so 
that many every-day and self-care actions (such as washing one’s hair) happen to take place there. 
As another LYS interviewee argues, 
I mean, if my phone rings at six o'clock in the morning, I get a shock because I think that [...] it's 
raining, now Lucha is flooding, we have to call the women [hosted at LYS], should we go there? 
In short, that's one of the first thoughts. (IIR3, LYS, 43) 
 
Boundaries blur, and they open up a different perception of time, in which both the space-time of 
self-care and the priorities of life change. During the night, which is conventionally the time of rest, 
if the phone rings, the thought does not go first to family, but to the FS. It is “the first thought,” as 
would be the case with a relative. Individual life “takes on other rhythms,” following the space’s daily 
life, pauses, and runs, as a LYS interviewee states: “things happen here with a chronic delay. Here 
things never happen at the time they should happen, they always happen at another time, and so your 
life takes on other rhythms” (IIR2, LYS, 37). The intensity of political participation in a FS changes 
the perceptions of time: “we always said that one year [at the CS] corresponded to five. It was true. 
It was really an eternity...” (IIIR5, CS, 30). Social perception can make time very slow or very fast. 
One year can be in the individual perception “an eternity,” as much as twelve years can dissolve in a 
second.  The  high  intensity  of  activities,  through  the  mediation  of  affects,  produces  an  extended 
perception time.  
The transformation of time thus concerns the biographical dimension and everyday life. But the 
perception  of  time  is  also  produced  by  the  action  of  social  movements.  To  take  part  in  social 
movements,  total  commitment  is  often  required,  and  the  withdrawal  from  this  commitment  is 
perceived by other activists and by the person themself as a betrayal. Thanks to the reflection on 
affects, the possibility of taking time for oneself is opened up in FSs without this being a betrayal to 
political  action.  It  often  happens  that  personal  conditions,  life  changes,  emotions  resulting  from 
collective action push the participants towards the need to thin out their involvement and to devote 
more time to their own life, their intimate relations, their work. The possibility of being able to take 
one's time, in places where there is a certain normativity in the use of time (and therefore the demand 
for "dedication to the cause") is not taken for granted. Conscious reflection on affects allows the 
meaning  of  time  and  participation  to  be  transformed,  giving  participants  the  possibility  of 
constructing  new  meanings  in  relation  to  political  participation.  This  space  of  possibility  fosters 
positive affects in the participants.  

175 
 
Time is also a source of suffering, because despite the social perception produced within the space, 
activists always have to confront the outside world, where other rhythms count. Neoliberal rules 
require the fulfilment of tasks and duties in order to survive. Despite the choice of a great personal 
investment in FSs, people have to perform their job, dividing their time between the FS and personal 
activities. The discrepancy between neoliberal time and feminist time produces feelings of fatigue 
and frustration. The time of work, the time to secure resources for subsistence, clashes with the time 
experienced in FSs. 
The mediation of affects interplays with individual perceptions of time. First, it changes the rhythm 
of daily life and its organisation. Secondly, it changes the perception of the intensity of time and its 
duration,  also  with  regard  to  political  participation.  Thirdly,  it  changes  the  relationship  between 
individual  and  social  time,  opening  up  a  transformation  of  priorities,  constantly  mediated  by 
neoliberal rules, which also produces feelings of unease.   
As much as the mediation of affects within FSs boosts counter-individual time, it does so at the meso-
level of collective action, too. Social movements are often trapped in the rules and constraints of the 
historical time they live in. In times of acceleration, they build upon a strict political agenda, an 
abundance of protests and productivity. How do FSs deal with time and politics?  
All of them reject the idea of a structured, imposed, and undeniable time. FSs aim to challenge social 
movements  and  the  neoliberal  time,  and  they  take  their  time  to  elaborate  methodologies  and 
repertoires,  networks  and  paths.  Politics  follows  the  rhythm  of  participants’  feelings.  As  a  CS 
interviewee develops, through the work on affects participants detect their rhythm: 
The care, the fact of realising how the comrades around you are, the fact of not having a priority 
that is given to us from the outside. And the possibility of saying: oh girls, no problem, no hurry, 
let's take our time. [...] You practise it because you try to experience the world as you would like 
to, and then you bring it back into your life outside the collective. (IIIR6, CS, 35) 
 
As the quote shows, the way time is managed in the FSs embeds elements of prefiguration. Taking 
their own time is a political practice that helps to bring to life the idea of the world envisaged by FSs. 
Through fighting the normativity of the political agenda, FSs learn to go slower. A CS interviewee 
argues: “we can also have three or four meetings to decide whether or not to participate in a march,” 
and “if you do not agree in an assembly, then either we do not agree or we talk about it for another 
twelve meetings until we find a point of agreement” (IIIR2, CS, 37). Consent is a slow process, 
sometimes tiring. Slowness and consent, embedded in the idea of feminist time, bring to unexpected 
strategies and tactics. To call it “slow” means to bring back a neoliberal understanding of time: that 
is why I call it “feminist time,” instead. When the priority is to preserve the structures of feelings, the 
political agenda and the timing of protests also change, as one CS interviewee explains: “we often 
skip appointments that are perhaps super important for the rest of Italy because we have not found 

176 
 
the sense of being there as a collective” (IIIR2, CS, 37). Although decision-making processes may 
seem ineffective, just as the choice of conscious work on affects may seem to shift the political focus, 
in reality they both allow FSs to elaborate claims, strategies, and tactics consistent with their ideology, 
in a sort of utopian realism. As a CS interviewee argues, “the potential we have is given by the fact 
that we are like that. [...] I like to do things the way we do because we try not to leave any piece 
behind. [...] And this stuff here certainly slows you down, but then it characterises the product, let's 
call it a product, which you give to the outside” (IIIR2, CS, 37). In this way, no one is left behind, 
and  action  is  strengthened  by  strategies  consistent  with  the  wishes,  energies  and  availability  of 
participants. This temporal method offers the outside world an example of affective prefigurative 
politics.  Especially  for  those  spaces  that  engage  with  forms  of  direct  social  action,  this  means 
proposing procedures that do not reproduce inequalities of the neoliberal system. Slower processes 
allow to transform social reality, as a LYS interviewee states:   
I think that this is what these places are mainly for, to maintain a healthy movement. Which 
perhaps doesn't exactly coincide with the visibility, the good health of the feminist movement. 
[...] This sometimes makes you slow down, it makes you lose pieces, it makes you be less incisive 
on the world... even if, in short, I think there has been nothing as incisive as the feminist movement 
in Italy. (IIR6, LYS, 45)  
 
As the quote shows, participants reflect on the possible ineffectiveness of slower politics. However, 
they recognise that, while following an unconventional timeframe, the feminist movement in the long 
term has managed to bring about profound social changes, probably unattainable without this kind of 
approach to time, too. To dismantle the social movements’ agenda and their implicit rules does not 
diminish the capacity for political action, but gives back "so much freedom." Building on this, a CS 
interviewee adds: “nobody pulls us by the jacket so we can take our time. [...] Nobody expects 
anything from us, and this is a great victory that the Cagne have achieved over the years. That is to 
set expectations to zero. That gives you so much freedom” (IIIR2, CS, 37).  
The situation of crisis all the FSs were dealing with challenges the feminist time. Their survival 
depends on the capacity to react and to promptly deal with twists and turns. Participants talk about 
the affects embedded in the nexus between time and crisis, which are mainly fatigue and tiredness. 
With regard to LYS’s strategies in relation to the crisis, an interviewee explains: “I have liberated 
this place, I have created something different, and I surprise you by coming to a resistance that is not 
the one you imagine, not the violent one, [...] but I give myself the dignity to make a different 
reasoning. To say: should I leave this place? I give myself my time to get out” (IIR7, LYS, 35). 
Institutional attacks produce fear, uncertainty, frustration, melancholy. The climate of precariousness 
demands a prompt response, always on time. Yet, participants draw on these affects to formulate 
another strategy for action. If their collective work in the FS was to continually produce a structure 

177 
 
of feelings, even in the situation of crisis and institutional threat the FS reaction is consistent with 
said structure. This correspondence between affective, cognitive, and bodily dimensions, this political 
elaboration rooted in the work on affects, helps to transform affects into collective action. Respecting 
the gradients of intensities that are produced during a crisis situation, processing the cognitive and 
bodily energies involved, transforming emotions are mechanisms that require another kind of time, 
and lead to other outcomes.  
The crisis situation intensifies the work on affection and caring, especially for spaces that carry out 
direct social action. By taking care of women escaping violence, the need for another time also comes 
from the need to find a solution for them, and to avoid forcing them into a situation of anxiousness 
and precarity. FSs deal with the time of the institutions by working on the affects generated in the 
relation: often, affects come to be a boundary to plan strategies and tactics. “I should have the ability 
to respect my nerves and my life time. Because I do not think it is right to put a collective of ten 
activists and fourteen women in this situation of anxiety and stress. [...] Which is dictated by someone 
else's times. On the times that someone is imposing on us by making us anxious, frightening us, 
terrorising us” (IIR7, LYS, 35). Emotions such as fear, dread, insecurity could lead to pure defensive 
strategies. Yet, the development of affect work allows participants a potential for imagination that 
would otherwise be precluded. Affect work does not make the negative emotions generated by the 
situation of crisis disappear, but it transforms them into a potential for awareness, strength, dignity, 
thus increasing the capacity for collective action.  
This constant work requires, as explored in the previous chapter, to be preserved through the ethics 
of care. The choice of another time is a choice of reciprocal care, that takes into account the emotional 
and physical consequences of crisis. A LYS interviewee expands on this: 
What has happened is that the stresses related to this place, related to the historical phase, to the 
precariousness, have created strong discomfort in our group. Comrades who are sick. [...] we can't 
let  ourselves  be  ruined  by  what  we  have  created  even  humanly  from  the  famous  times  that 
someone else says. [...] And at least we give ourselves in the best possible way, with the greatest 
possible awareness that what you are looking for in your life is to pursue political goals but also 
somehow to feel good. That what you do makes you feel good. (IIR7, LYS, 35)  
 
As the quote shows, FSs work on the way the body, emotions, blood, and sweat are part of political 
action. With this awareness, FSs engage with strategies and tactics oriented to social change, through 
“feeling good.” Positive affects are deemed the precondition for political action, otherwise they lose 
the very sense of action. This reflection brings together affects and time: through the mediation of 
time, FSs are able to negotiate the social time, institutional time, and feminist time, by increasing 
their potential for collective action.

7.2.2 A Place Called “Home”  
 
The occupied space for me is a home in terms that it is a place of shelter, it is my comfort zone. [...] It is a re-
signifying of the term “home” that desacralises the house as a place but it recovers the positive meaning of 
shelter. (IIIR10, CS, 30) 
 
Asked about the first words coming to their mind when thinking about the FS, participants often 
reply: “first, home” (IIIR10, CS, 30). Most of the interviewees, at some point, define their FS as 
“home,” and so I started to question participants about that. The concept of home refers to challenges 
to the symbolic order of the private space, the nuclear family, and intimacies. On the other hand, it 
allows participants to retrieve a positive meaning of home, care, and affect, by dismantling gender 
inequalities embedded in these concepts. This process is an expression of the way in which conscious 
work on affects modifies space, breaking the symbolic order of certain dichotomies – such as the 
private/public – that still underpin the social world. By debunking the idea of home, participants 
change the potential for action within the political space.  
In this section, I will explore the cognitive and bodily association between FSs and home in the 
perception of participants as a site of social change. On one hand, the concept of home blurs the 
boundaries between private and public space. On the other hand, the practice of communal cooking 
and eating comes to enhance the community building process.  
 
Homeliness  
By calling their space “home,” participants break the boundaries between private and public spaces. 
This in-between space hosts affective ties that challenge the obligation to the nuclear family and to 
social expectations. FSs are considered home because of the ties with significant others, that produce 
the feeling of a place to belong to. They are places of everyday rituals, where affects that are normally 
relegated to the private sphere and separated from social life become part of public life and social 
interactions. One CS interviewee tells how affections change feelings related to public and private 
places: 
Generally, we all live in spaces we don't live in... which can be work, university, home... and we 
generally live these spaces individually... [...] while the [feminist] space has really questioned 
how you live an open, public, and free space... a bit like your home but it is not your home, [...] 
because anyway you live it as a space of intimacy, as a space to take care of, as a space that 
welcomes you, and at the same time where you can bring and leave things about you... but it is 
also public. (IIIR7, CS, 30) 
 
The quote allows to understand how boundaries between public and intimate life blur. Private spaces 
are often individually-based, or they are the site of the nuclear family. FSs are collective and public, 

179 
 
but participants share the same sense of intimacy. In FSs, participants take care of others and of the 
place, but this does not make it any less “public.” Rather than the place of the nuclear family, home 
is the site of the community. FSs enhance the idea that home can be with other women, trans, and 
non-binary people. This social form has never been envisaged, because home is usually the site of 
the nuclear, heterosexual, and reproductive family. Whether the nuclear family has historically been 
a place of social reproductive work and women’s subjugation (Della Costa and James 1975), FSs 
question blood relations by claiming “families of choice.” Rather than ties based on blood, they claim 
new types of kinship based on affection, shared values, and everyday practices. As a CS interviewee 
explains: 
For me, the rejection of the familistic viewpoint and the role of the biological family in my life 
does not necessarily imply that I do not need a physical place or to not find shelter. [...] It means 
building even closer relationships [...]. And the family of choice is the series of people [...] with 
whom I have decided to share my life. In everyday life, in misfortunes, in sorrows, in joys. [...] 
Because I feel that in my life I need care, to give it, to receive it, to entrust myself, to trust. And I 
have decided to do it this way. (IIIR10, CS, 30) 
 
Breaking the bonds of the nuclear family requires building even closer emotional ties. Just as the 
family is associated with the home, so the affective ties are associated with the FSs that become, 
therefore, homes. FSs are perceived as homes because they are sites of affects. The sphere of emotions 
is normally relegated to the home: there, you come to terms with your emotions, you feel alone, you 
sometimes discuss your feelings with your relatives. And yet, the FSs have unhinged the work on 
affections from the private sphere to hinge it on a collective, public, political process. Through FSs, 
participants elaborate on their sufferings and needs, sickness, and biographical shifts. As a LYS 
interviewee says “for me it is no coincidence that I faced super personal biographical events at a time 
when I found a space of women who welcomed me, who made a family. It was like a way of saying: 
I enter Lucha so I can get my wings. And I am not afraid of using them” (IIR5, LYS, 33).  
The feeling of being able to work on affects in a political place invests it with a sense of homeliness. 
The  gradient  of  intensity  of  this  feeling  intensifies  during  particular  biographical  shifts,  such  as 
illness,  death,  mourning.  FSs  are  settings  of  care  which  people  can  tap  into  for strength  and 
empowerment, as a LYS interviewee shows:  
I have cancer, Laura has a possibly degenerative disease, and the group has not only held on to 
this stuff here, it has multiplied in its care, in its attention, in keeping us all closer, more resilient, 
all together, because it is not your evil, it is ours. In short, it was powerful. [...] Even if in the 
worst period I could not come here very much. I couldn't be in contact with the children, I couldn't 
be in contact with women, so I couldn't come here a lot and so on, but... it continued to be my 
home. (IIR3, LYS, 43) 
 
Just like homes, in FSs participants find an informal network to deal with personal troubles and 

180 
 
biographical transition. Many of them keep growing and changing together with the FS. “It's a bit 
like home now [...]. I have been here during the years when I have changed so much, I was 18 years 
old... and all my various transformations have found a place” (IIR8, LYS, 30). Most of them, across 
years, changed several houses, and the only one remaining the same is the political one.  
As already mentioned, home is where everyday rituals take place: breakfast, showering, conventional 
celebrations like Christmas or birthday parties. 
We acted as if it were a collective house. [...] There were obviously also the cool things that I 
think are the sharing of any aspect of everyday life. From waking up, to breakfast [...]. Assemblies 
at all hours of the day according to what we had to do, the rooms where we would fuck, the rooms 
where we would eat. (IIIR10, CS, 30) 
 
What is involved in sharing the rituals of daily life? On the one hand, learning to know the affect and 
emotions of other people, and on the other, building on this grammar of daily life a collective structure 
of feelings.  
As well as rituals, FSs allow objects of daily life to find a space. The architectural structure, the type 
of colours and objects, are part of a general impression people receive from FSs. Each of them 
stimulates to participants a sense of homeliness. A CS interviewee locates the feeling of homeliness 
in positive emotions, like warmth and comfort: “this thing of warmth, of welcome, of embrace. [...] 
It is more emotional warmth. Because there is always room for things. Like in beautiful houses you 
choose” (IIIR4, CS, 30). Positive feelings coming from the association with the house increase the 
desire to participate, to take care of the space, and to engage in collective action. The idea of home 
holds prefigurative elements, as one LYS interviewee explains: “If you want to fight you need a space 
from which to start your projects. If you want to change the world it's different if you have a home to 
do it from. Inside of which you can build this image of a different world. And inside of which you 
can experience this idea of a different world” (IIR1, LYS, 37).  
While dealing with older generations of activists at the CID, I realised that together with all these 
factors, they express a sense of belonging coming from their biographical trajectory. Older feminists’ 
connection with the FS reflect a path of achievement of meanings, goals, and sense of their own life. 
They called the persistence of a community of women “a leitmotif,” which keeps working in their 
old  age.  Despite  the  relative  rejection  of  a  neoliberal  world  which  does not offer  dignity  and 
recognition  to  elder  women,  through  women’s  houses  they  produce  their  own  sense  of  dignity, 
belonging, and well-being. “For me the house is my home. [...] Referring to a community of women 
is fundamental. It is a question of meaning, political but also existential” (IR7, CID, 67).  
The same process works for FSs that host women escaping violence. To share a path of common 
growth is considered more significant than sharing a blood tie. By finding a shelter, women find a 

181 
 
network of relationships and a space to question their feelings and emotions. This process increases 
their tools to deal with violence and inequalities.  
The concept of home always has a double facet. On one hand, it is the depositary of the positive 
dimensions I outlined so far. On the other hand, it carries out the similar troubles of a private house. 
As private homes, it is ambiguous and contradictory, it is a field of protection and freedom as well as 
constraints and isolation, as clarified by a CS interviewee: “it is a place from which you often feel 
like getting out and perhaps risk locking yourself in” (IIIR2, CS, 37).  
 
Feeding Politics: Around the Kitchen Tables 
During the fieldwork, I had moments where I understood the association between home and FSs in 
some spaces such as the kitchen, or places connected to the fruition of food. Why are kitchens so 
important in FSs’ life? Why does everyday life in the kitchen politically matter? How does food 
become an element of doing politics? 
In some of the spaces I followed, the kitchen is the core room in the development of activities. With 
regard to LYS, at the ground floor there is a big room which used to be a guest room. At some point, 
participants felt the need to create a common space: a kitchen. That room became the core of the 
space. In the room there are always women, and whoever wants to chat always passes through that 
room. During winter, when the other rooms are too cold, they hold assemblies in that kitchen. During 
the fieldwork I noted down: “the kitchen is the place where women usually meet, drink coffee, tell 
each other their stories. It is a place of food and drink, where they take care of each other, fight, stay 
with the children. It is as if the kitchen automatically conveys a sense of intimacy, and the connection 
is easier and more immediate. In the kitchen we are all the same. I am no longer a researcher at Scuola 
Normale, but a woman who talks to Zaira and has tools to help her. And she speaks to me without 
reverence, horizontally [...]. Paula [a newly arrived woman hosted at LYS] is also in the kitchen. 
Because she can get to know people and pass the time [...]. The kitchen is a place to look out, through 
a large window, but also a place to be protected from the outside, like a nest or a cave. Anyone who 
enters or leaves passes through the kitchen: to take a look, say hello, have a chat, sit down and rest. 
The kitchen seems to be the heart of this house.” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 03-07-19). This setting favours 
intimate sharing and the dismantling of roles and power dynamics. In the kitchen, women can share 
information, fears, elaborate strategies together, both for individuals and for the community.  
Kitchens are rooms where women manage food and feed each other. Food is a vehicle of community 
building, and a tool for prefigurative politics. Many moments of conviviality, sharing, and encounters 
happened through the sharing of meals. Big lunches, or dinners, were organised in the occasion of 
public events, and were also organised in favour of the community meetings. During events, very 

182 
 
often spaces offer a dinner or use dinners for self-financing. Sharing food is the occasion to talk and 
to create a more intimate and warm environment. In moments of tension or contention, collective 
meals became the occasion to ease spirits. While discussing about food preparation for events during 
an assembly, a participant says that “cooking is also a way of sharing and being together” (Fieldnotes, 
LYS, 04-07-19). On the same occasion, at the beginning of the assembly a dinner was organised. 
Everyone was invited to prepare and share food from their own country. On that occasion, women 
enjoy other women’s typical food, learn to know new traditions, uses, and tastes. In a way, it is 
learning to know and to respect each other. Sharing food is a way to take care of each other. The 
mediation of affects makes participants aware of the needs of the body. Through the nourishment of 
the body, participants nourish the emotional bond between them, and take care of themselves. In this 
sense, kitchens are places of political elaboration, and food becomes a tool for transforming collective 
affects into political practices. 
 
In this section, I went through the association between FSs and the concept of home. By blurring the 
boundaries between private and public, FSs engage with collective places that challenge neoliberal 
individualism. They are places where affective ties become a family of choice, beyond and against 
the nuclear family. There, rituals of everyday life are made into politics, such as the management of 
food. Kitchens, both as physical and symbolic places, allow FSs to be places where affects become 
the ground for collective action. The instinctive association between a political space and home is the 
result of working on affects and creating structures of feelings. This work transforms the potential of 
spaces, and thus the potential for collective action. 
 
 
7.3 Transforming Affects into Action  
 
 
7.3.1 “Glitter, of Course!”: Innovating Repertoire of Actions 
  
G.B.R.: Why did you tell me that this space is different and acts differently?  
[...] 
Well, glitter, of course! (IIIR4, CS, 30)  
 
On 14 March 2014, a post on Twitter from the channel of Cagne Sciolte spread the notice of a 
cemented toilet in front of the Pertini hospital, in Rome, where a few days before a woman was left 
alone and had had an abortion in the toilet of the hospital. The post claimed: “action at Pertini in 
Rome: a toilet to tell you you’re shit! the objectors [obiettori di coscienza, doctors who refuse to 

183 
 
perform abortions] out of our pants #objectonthispussy”
19
. One month after, on the 12 April, with 
face masks and creative dresses they got in front of the Ministry of Health, they arranged in a semi-
circle and they all peed together, holding the banner “We piss on your conscience” (playing with the 
Italian expression obiezione di coscienza for doctors who refuse to perform abortions). As Taylor and 
Van Dyke outline, “The tactics of protest used by social movements are so integral to popular views 
of social movements that sometimes a movement is remembered more for its tactics than for its goals” 
(2004: 263). 
The sentence of the opening quotes of the section, “glitter, of course!,” signals the disruptive, creative, 
and blatant hallmark of feminists actions. Scholars refer to a “repertoire of contention” in order to 
focus on the tactics and strategies developed by movements over time, that have direct or indirect 
influence on nowadays’ actions (Tilly 1978; Tarrow 1993). FSs refer to feminist movement’s legacy: 
present politics comes from a historical repertoire, relationships, and affect. However, FSs’ efforts 
are intended to broaden the boundaries of routinised practices. So far, I engaged with the role of 
affects in FSs. Affects work as 1) a channel of mediation between cognition and bodies, 2) a tool for 
political elaboration, 3) a competence in action. In the previous sections, I explored how affects are 
transformed into action with regard to time and space. How do they come to be a competence in 
action with regard to the repertoire of action? Which types of collective actions are consequent to the 
elaboration on affects?  
 
Collective action arises from the impulse of affects, and produces affects. The practice of collective 
elaboration on individual experiences enhances the participants’ positive feelings. The construction 
of collective action is therefore based on the well-being of participants, who can channel their social 
emotions – such  as  anger,  frustration,  discomfort – into  actions  capable  of  transforming  these 
emotions.  As  Taylor  and  Van  Dyke  underline, “radical  feminists  [...]  adopted  collectivist 
organizational forms and emotional expressiveness as part of a larger repertoire of direct action, 
justifying these strategies on the basis of fundamental differences between women and men and a 
rejection of masculinist styles” (2004: 265). The capacity to undo routinised action fosters a creative 
approach to collective action, where everyone can feel comfortable and, at the same time, capable of 
transforming reality.  One  CS  interviewee  expresses  the  wonder  of  discovering  that  a  number  of 
routines of political action can be subverted and transformed through creativity developed in the FSs: 
“those of us who have had collective experiences before knew that going out in the street was the 
way to be visible... there were a series of rules, there was a pattern... that everyone and everyone 
 
19
 https://twitter.com/CagneSciolte/status/445515369491357696 

184 
 
followed in going out in the street... and when we entered the space [...] we realised that we could 
bring out of there and out of us a whole series of ideas, practices, ways of being out that we had never 
tried” (IIIR7, CS, 30). FSs break away from a set of conventional rules of protest, and try to open up 
a space of political imagination.  
In order to express the potential of political imagination through the circulation of affects, participants 
refer to the circle, as has already emerged in the previous sections. With the notion of the politics of 
the circle I refer to the practice of standing in a circle, both during assemblies and during collective 
action. This shape is both a symbolic glue and a political action. The position of the bodies in a 
circular form makes it possible, on the one hand, to always perceive another body next to one's own, 
and to see other bodies in all directions of gaze, and then feeds the circulation of cognitive practices 
through the mediation of affects. As a CS interviewee explains, “within the assemblies we give 
ourselves a series of practices like standing in a circle and looking at each other, like listening to each 
other and not talking to each other, like taking the speaking turns because there were so many of us, 
so we necessarily needed to make a list” (IIIR7, CS, 30). The circle is a way of undertaking decision-
making processes, but also protests. The symbolic glue of the circle keeps participants together during 
marches, and nights out, through an affective connection which makes them feel safer and pleasant. 
Another CS participant explains the concept of the circle as “the ability to always have an eye out for 
each other, to look at situations, to stop if you see something you don't like, this is something we all 
do. And that makes us feel safe, all of us, when we're out and about together” (IIIR6, 35, CS). The 
circle represents the circularity of care, a reciprocal interaction between participants which stimulates 
the emergence of emotions – positive and negative – and their transformation through a collective 
taking charge, both during the assemblies and during the public protests. 
The three types of spaces in this research elaborate different strategies and tactics, depending on their 
counterparts, composition, goals, and structures of feelings. All of them shared the choice to occupy 
in order to target the persistence of gender-based violence and social inequalities. Yet, the CID, 
because of its relative institutionalisation, refers to a quite conventional repertoire of action. The other 
two FSs adopt a creative and disruptive orientation: CS is more oriented to a provocative manner, 
while LYS, because of the need to manage a shelter, is working for inclusive and larger mobilisation.  
The CID adopts more routinised types of engagement in conventional marches and rituals. In order 
to pursue their goals, they work closer to institutional channels, they negotiate with the municipality, 
commissions,  and  major  donors,  in  order  to raise  funds.  The  older  age  of  the  participants,  life 
perspectives, and political goals lead them to adopt less disruptive forms of action. The structure of 
feelings is oriented towards preserving a stable place for people in their old age. Some affections 
often resulting from the discovery of structures of social inequality – such as anger – are mitigated 

185 
 
by a long process of awareness, both personal and political. As a result, collective action draws on a 
spectrum of affects that are less disruptive and more balance-oriented. Rational evaluations prevail 
on emotional flush, and they sometimes shrink the space for innovation. 
A strong creative attitude, instead, orients LYS’s repertoire of action. The creation of a self-managed 
shelter for women escaping violence, that keeps existing after fourteen years, signals their visionary 
approach. With regard to an institutional lack, they claim for more resources, but at the same time 
they engage with direct social action (Bosi and Zamponi 2020). In order to allow the shelter to keep 
existing, participants work on communication, on political translation (because of the relationship 
with  migrant  women  hosted  at  the  space),  and  on  inclusive  practices  to  broaden  the  scope  of 
stakeholders.  To  face  the  threat  of  eviction  and  to  negotiate  with  institutions,  they  engage  in 
broadening the visibility of LYS through a huge committee of members that manage LYS beyond the 
smaller  collective.  The  broadening  of  support  for  LYS  is  based  on  an  emotional  and  political 
understanding of the issue of male violence against women. People from the outside are invited to 
get to know both the participants and the women living in LYS, to share with them the everyday life, 
the affective intensities, the circulation of emotions. Through the mobilisation of collective passions, 
the support base for LYS has expanded over the years, allowing for the development of innovative 
forms of collective action. They pursue campaigns based on visuals and comics, and a direct and 
sometimes assertive bargain with local governments. Among the campaigns they developed there 
were a call to the arts to design luchadoras, i.e. feminist heroines, which were then plastered all over 
the city of Rome; the projection of a huge sign with the LYS symbol on a series of monuments and 
places in the city; the creation of a mask that is worn during public protests and that makes LYS 
instantly recognisable. These creative and performative actions arise from the sharing of affective 
intensities, are aimed at producing an affective reaction in bystanders, and they convey a message 
that moves not only cognitively, but also emotionally. 
Innovation, performativity, and playing orient the CS’s repertoire of action. With “Cagna style,” they 
outline a general attitude toward politics, as being provocative, ironic, sometimes aggressive, and 
they make a political use out of having fun. They often say they do politics “like the crazy ones [come 
le matte].” Through the collective work on anger, this emotion is transformed into an ironic and 
provocative  charge  towards  the  outside  world.  This  emotional  intensity  characterises  both  the 
elaboration and the construction of the public protests. As an interviewee explains, “we have always 
been seen [...] as unreliable and unpredictable. In the sense that we have always decided to occupy 
public space, [...] in a way that was very provocative, sometimes even situationist” (IIIR10, CS, 30). 
This  attitude  makes  their  activities  immediately  distinguishable.  Actions  like  performing  a  punk 
concert in front of the Russian embassy claiming for the liberation of Pussy Riot activists, the “slut 

186 
 
walks” at night with extremely whimsical clothing and blatant slogans, a karaoke held on an entire 
tram line challenging the newly approved municipal law which prohibits singing on public transports, 
are  just  few  example  of  this  “Cagna  style.”  In  these actions,  they  make  an  extensive  use  of 
performativity. Performativity concerns clothes, but also the way actions are “put on the stage,” the 
use of dirty language as a reappropriation, the creation of proper shows and performances as a vehicle 
for political message. Cabaret, post-porn shows, karaoke, theatre performances are integral parts of 
their way of producing and diffusing a political culture based on a feminist structure of feelings. 
These actions focus on the body as a site of experimentation and political expression. The body 
perceives,  is  in  play  with  other  bodies,  and  expresses  something  in  public  space.  Through  the 
mediation of affects, cognitive practices are transformed into bodily practices, which communicate 
in public space. Along with this, playing is an integral part of their repertoire. The self-managed pole 
dance lab held within the space allowed them to work on body, self-perception, stereotypes, and 
empowerment. They use workshops and labs in order to disentangle gender-based violence and power 
dynamics. Playing means also having fun: the political use of irony and having fun opens up to 
channels of communication and agency in the public space. As an interviewee develops, “it's like a 
cathartic moment of release, liberation, of doing stupid things that's good for you, it makes you laugh, 
it strengthens the group, because you're doing this thing together and there's always a level of [...] 
danger. [...] So there's that level of attention, of complicity, of looking at each other” (IIIR, CS, 30). 
Emotions  related  to  pleasure,  joy,  and  well-being  in  participating  in  collective  action  expand 
individual agency and the capacity for collective action. These positive affects are in fact multipliers 
of the affective intensity gradient and expand skills and the ability to have an impact. Irony and having 
fun together strengthen the group and the capacity for collective action, as well as rational strategies 
and tactics. 
The three strategies mirror different collective identity, composition, goals, and structures of feelings. 
However, all of them display the role of affects as a mediation between political elaboration and 
collective action, and as a competence in collective action. Affects enable the recognition of targets, 
goals, and strategies, the construction of innovative forms of action and increase the capacity for 
collective action. Although affects and emotions are always present in collective action, in the case 
of FSs they are consciously taken into account and strategically engaged with to build collective 
action.  
The glitter recalled in the opening quote is the symbol of this visionary political action, based on a 
creative impulse, on the use of the body in political action, on the transformation of social emotions 
into political emotions at the service of collective action. The glitter represents the desire to draw on 
an imagery of joy, provocative, liberating for the participants. In collective action and through the 

187 
 
display of positive emotions, participants get in contact with the possibility of transforming social 
emotions, and making them the subject of collective agency.  
 
 
7.3.2 Producing Knowledge, Challenging Codes  
 
Raffaella comes in complaining that the projector is not working, Daria gives her another one and tells her: 
“God help you, or the Goddess [in the feminine form], or in short, who for her.” (Fieldnotes, CID, 19-11-18) 
 
This example of everyday chats and jokes between women sheds light on the innovative repertoire 
of  knowledge  and  codes  developed  by  FSs.  The  creation  of  a  gendered  imaginary,  of  an  ideal 
mythology  of  women,  signals  the  feminist  intervention  on  culture.  Gender  as  social  production 
becomes a site for the symbolic subversion of oppressive social structures. The field of gender is thus 
rewritten as an emotional and political place of strength, pride, solidarity, and transformation.  
Some  events,  retrieved  from the  fieldnotes,  show  the  ongoing  repertoire  of  knowledge  practices 
implemented by FSs. “An event, held by Lucha, is focused on cancer and integrated treatments. One 
of LYS's participants, who presents the event, has lived the experience of blood cancer and still does. 
[...] She introduces the event by talking about her experience and integrated treatments, that are quite 
inaccessible to many women. After her, an expert talks about integrated therapies, and tells about the 
opening of the first integrated therapy centre in Rome. [...] Afterwards Sara, another sick woman, 
attacks the centre and the association that promotes it – Susan Komen – to have among the sponsors 
of the race for cure, groups whose environmental and social misdeeds are well known. The doctor is 
very much affected and after a short while she leaves. The meeting is quite quarrelsome [...]. Sitting 
together are "experts" and sick women, who are experts in their own way. This meeting proposes a 
different sharing of knowledge, in which each one contributes and has the right to speak about her 
knowledge and her body. The meeting is attended by many women with illnesses themselves or close 
to people with illnesses. Sara comments that this is precisely why the meeting was conceived as an 
opportunity that is not given anywhere to get in touch with certain knowledge and information” 
(Fieldnotes, LYS, 28-06-19). As the fieldwork episode shows, FSs represent places of knowledge 
production that challenge the codes of expert knowledge. Historically, the women's movement has 
challenged knowledge paradigms that did not take into account the experience, body, and thought of 
women, trans, and non-binary people. In physical places such as FSs, feminist movements bring 
forward  alternative  knowledges  that  enable  participants  to  build  a  different  awareness  on  social 
structures. This practice of knowledge is a material possibility to change the biographical trajectory, 

188 
 
as  in  the  case  of  sick  people  who  can  draw from different  information  for  their  own course  of 
treatment.  
In order to produce their own repertoire of knowledge practices, FSs work on frames, ideology, and 
language.  
The  collective  identity  of  participants  is  related  to  the  FSs’  story  and  narratives.  At  the  CID, 
participants call themselves “the women of the house,” referring to the notion of “women” (rather 
than activists), and to an identitarian connection between identity and the space. In the case of LYS, 
participants call themselves “the Luche,” by referring to Zapatistas’ struggles and to the orientation 
toward direct social action. CS’s participants call themselves “Cagne” (female dogs), which alludes 
to trans and queer feminism, and challenges gender binarism, the moral approach to sexuality, and 
the social role of women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people. As an interviewee develops, “for 
me Cagne keeps many things inside [...] with respect to practices, experimentation... the approach to 
life  which  is  often  disruptive,  stubborn,  annoying,  disarming...  it  can  be  violent,  clearly 
contextualised... it's always... I disagree!” (IIIR7, CS, 30). The collective identity is tied to the framing 
process of each space (Benford and Snow 2000). It suggests their vision of the world, the tool to 
change  it,  the  ideological  background.  The  three  FSs  are  related  to  different  feminist  ideologies 
(Melucci 1996). CID refers to historical feminism; they come from the 1970s and they keep that 
memory in the present. LYS, instead, refers to Southern popular feminism and direct social action. 
CS is oriented toward queer theory and transfeminism, a recent strand coming from collective action 
upon  sexuality  and  gender.  The  language  of  everyday  life  refers  to  cognitive  practices,  to  the 
relationship with the body, and to the mediation of affects. Starting from the sharing of a series of 
collective emotions, participants develop cognitive practices and a certain idea of relationship with 
the body, from which follows their own way of dealing with the social reality. This is why the 
language of everyday life, such as the way of naming oneself as a participant in a space, signals the 
repertoire of knowledge and the codes produced by the space itself.  
Each word and notion is a field of contention, that is telling of the FSs’ knowledge production. During 
an interview with a CS’s participant, she told me that she rejects the very notion of activism. “Because 
activism is typical of associationism. That is, the point is not to be activists, not even to be militant, 
not even to be avant-garde, the point is to take on things in your life that then permeate your whole 
life. In other words, it's not that you are an activist. That's your life. It's not a separate stuff, so I have 
4  hours  that  I  dedicate  to  the  association  and  I  do  activism.  [...]  I'm  trying  to  do  it  in  all  the 
manifestations of my being alive” (IIIR2, CS, 37). The refusal to refer to the symbolic universe of 
activism tells a lot about the ideological and cultural roots of FSs. Politics is not a separate activity 
from life, but every manifestation of life is an expression of political will. Similarly to environmental 

189 
 
movements,  feminist  movements  refer  on  the  one  hand  to  the  congruence  between  theory  and 
practice, and thus to prefigurative politics, and on the other hand to subjectivity as a field of political 
action.  
FSs work for the innovation of words, language, and codes, even though sometimes they risk not 
being understandable. Despite the risk, some of them prefer this creative and provocative use of 
language instead of risking the oversimplification. Others, such as LYS, claim for the capacity to 
change language, one that aims at being understandable for all women, more than reproducing a 
hermetic language.  
As well as knowledge, FSs produce cultural artefacts, that is “objects like texts or narratives employed 
or produced collectively during these performances” (Johnston 2009: 7). We can generally include in 
this definition objects like fanzines, zines, books, vademecums, posters, flyers, comics, banners, and 
archives. The space of CS, for instance, after several workshops on gender-based violence, produced 
The Vademecum of the Good Friend, to help friends and parents to deal with someone next to them 
who is living a situation of violence. As an interviewee states, FSs need “a paper, something you can 
go and read. A documentation, something... [...] because in my opinion, when you do that job, a bit 
of stuff comes out” (IIIR1, CS, 37). FSs engage with the production of cultural artifacts in order to 
fulfill the structural lack of history, memory, and thought regarding women, lesbians, trans, and non-
binary people. This way of producing knowledge is an inherent part of their repertoire of action, 
intended to pursue goals and to address their opponents.  
As  the  section  shows,  the  work  on  affects  orients  both  repertoires  of  action  and  repertoires  of 
knowledge. Both are vehicles of social change that FSs act upon through the mediation of affect. 
Emotions  become  tools  to  elaborate  new  codes  with  which  to  define  themselves,  that  challenge 
hegemonic social languages and transform the framework to understand reality. 
 
7.3.3 Feminist Direct Social Actions 
 
During the fieldwork at LYS, I got to know a woman who had been living (not continuously) for 
almost ten years at Lucha Y Siesta. She got there after several experiences of gender-based violence, 
and she was taking her time to recover. During the stay, thanks to her training as a biologist, she 
managed to open a sort of “plant clinic.” As well as taking care of the flourishing garden of LYS, she 
invited people of the neighbourhood to bring their sick plants, so she could take care of them and 
bring them back to life. Then, either people took plants back or they left them in the LYS garden. The 
story of the plant clinic is telling of the specificity of feminist direct social actions (FDSA). All the 
FSs taken into account bring about forms of direct social action, either as anti-violence centres or 

190 
 
feminist  services  and  provision  (gynaecological  clinic,  psychological  support,  counselling,  job 
support, parental training, etc.). As the above-mentioned story shows, the woman was at the same 
time hosted at the space and taking care of the relationships with people of the neighbourhood. She 
was  not  only  receiving  help  and  support,  but  also  offering  her  skills  and  time  to  improve  the 
community  and  LYS’s  stakeholders’  well-being.  The  ability  to  work  on  affects  is  a  tool  that 
transforms roles in collective action, and increases the capacity for action. The ability to listen to 
others, to take care as a tool of interdependence and reciprocity, are affective competences developed 
in the political elaboration of the FSs that become tools that transform the action itself. FDSAs, 
though, rely on the development of awareness of affects and emotions, and this work increases the 
capacity for collective action and social change.   
The section is intended to outline the FDSAs’ specificities according to the FSs’ work on affects. 
All the FSs taken in consideration engage with direct social action and point out lack of DSAs in 
contemporary social movements, as a LYS participant states: “there has clearly been a political crisis 
in the movements after Genoa. From then on there has been a descent that continues. [...] And this is 
the aesthetics of politics. [...] We need concrete actions” (IIR4, LYS, 53). Together with the lack of 
DSAs there emerges also a lack of prefigurative politics, as the choice to “prefigure” the kind of 
society social movements want to bring about (Leach 2013: 512). As a LYS interviewee claims,  
All that aesthetic stuff that mixed movements have been doing for years, where you mime the 
alternative, but you don't practice it... You have to practice the alternative. [...] Otherwise it's a 
nice idea of yours, but it has little relevance to reality. [...] Instead of doing the super-fuckin' cool 
thing of the debate, maybe you accompany her [a woman in need] to Frosinone for her thyroid 
exams. Because social change is in that exchange. (IIR3, LYS, 43) 
 
This quote shows the FSs’ participants’ approach to collective action, which is based on FDSA and 
prefigurative politics. From the analysis of collective affects and the use of emotions comes the 
willingness to engage with FDSAs. The mediation of affects leads to a direct intervention in the social 
structures, not mediated by recourse to the state and institutions. Often, the very need for space for 
FDSAs is a trigger for collective action, as a CS interviewee argues: “the idea of the anti-violence 
shelter was the only thing we had clear in our heads when we entered [in the space] about what we 
wanted to put in there, everything else came afterwards” (IIIR9, CS, 35).  
FDSAs influence the creation of the physical and political shape of FSs. As an example, anti-violence 
services have to be separated spaces, without the presence of biological men. The physical space 
where some functions take place, such as the room for the reception of women, have to be welcoming 
and cosy. This requirement often shrinks with the typical setting of squatted centres, with banners, 
posters,  and  wall  paintings.  Affects  emerge  as  elements  that  shape  the  space  (a  space  that  is 
welcoming  and  ready  to  receive  women);  as  a  matter  for  political  action  (taking  charge  of  the 

191 
 
emotions linked to violence and inequalities experienced by women); and as a tool for transformation 
(the work on individual emotions as a process of empowerment and autonomy). 
Usually, FDSAs arise because of a lack of public services or institutional provisions, as explained by 
a LYS participant: “in the occupations there are often people who have been in a state of uneasiness 
for a long time, and that perhaps the State, the institutions do not care about all. [...] We here [at 
LYS] have built the tools to build these processes of collective emancipation over time” (IIR3, LYS, 
43). From a historical point of view, anti-violence services were created by feminist movements. At 
the  present  time,  anti-violence  services  are  partially  regulated  by  institutions  through local  and 
national regulations, that FSs challenge. FSs question anti-violence management protocols and the 
provision  of  adequate  resources.  Institutional  protocols  lack  adequate  attention  to  the  affective 
structures  that  fuel  certain  inequalities  and  which,  if  addressed,  can  also  change  the  individual's 
approach to such inequalities. Public services often make use of FDSAs, because “they themselves 
don't know where to bang their heads” (IR7, CID, 67), or because of a concrete strength of FDSAs in 
designing the social intervention. Institutions perform a limping behaviour, between recognition and 
attack. 
To transform affects into action, FSs put forward collective action, the production of knowledge, and 
direct  action.  To  target  gender-based  violence requires  both  DSA  and  a  politics  of  contention, 
otherwise “there is always a piece missing” (IIR5, LYS, 32). Differently than other public services, 
FDSAs  aim  to  enhance  women,  lesbian,  trans,  and  non-binary  people’s consciousness  on  social 
emotions and collective affects, translated into empowerment and agency. The path of recovery is 
built upon the improvement of the capacity to choose for themselves and to pursue one’s well-being. 
The work on affects is intended to increase women’s capacity for action and their agency with regard 
to life issues.  
It is also part of the development of feminist methodology for FDSA. With regard to anti-violence 
services  they  do  work  in a  team;  they  collectively  discuss  cases;  they  are  supervised  by  a 
psychotherapist.  Deliberation,  as  well,  is  a  relational  effort.  At  LYS,  a  weekly  assembly  keeps 
together  participants  and  women  hosted  at  the centre,  in  order  to  promote  horizontal  decisions. 
Affective ties are essential to the healing process, and personal developments are strengthened by the 
work on social emotions.  
Feminist methodology concerns the relationship between participants and women that reach FDSAs. 
Women are not considered as users, but part of a shared effort toward individual and social change. 
Rather than solving women’s problems, participants aim at building together tools for change. By 
challenging welfarism, FDSAs do not offer solutions nor fill the lack of public services, but they aim 
to put feminist ideology into practice. Because of this aim, participants often run into frustration. 

192 
 
Their ideal would be to bring women closer to feminism, and this can either happen or not. By 
confronting  with  the  material  life  of  women,  participants  learn  to  broaden  the  understanding  of 
women’s empowerment, as a LYS interviewee reflects upon:  
what matters most in the end? It is that a woman who didn't know it before knows that she has 
her own identity... that there is a world that is made in a certain way and that in some world she 
is positioned in a certain place. [...] You are not an activist, you are not a feminist, but maybe 
you are able to defend yourself in life and understand that there are injustices and that you don't 
have to suffer them. (IIR3, LYS, 43)  
 
The result of FDSA on women is not necessarily to turn them into feminists, but to give them the 
tools to understand their own emotions and to learn how to use them in a world strongly marked by 
structures of social inequality. 
If learning that not all women who enter the service become feminists can disabuse participants of 
their expectations, so too do power relations sometimes produce disillusionment. The illusion of 
horizontality dissolves because of the different roles that participants and women play. Different roles 
produce different responsibilities. Women are invited to take part in the community’s daily life and 
management,  both  by  caring  about  the  physical  spaces  and  relationships,  and  by  taking  part  in 
decision-making processes. Women are invited to raise their own voice in moments of collective 
discussion in order to work on power dynamics, as well as deciding a deal that everyone has to respect 
(timing, meeting, and so on). Women are invited to support other women that get in touch with 
FDSAs, such as by taking part in the reception, sharing food and information, by creating a cosy 
environment. As women learn from participants and grow with them, participants, too, improve their 
path through their relationships with women. They learn to negotiate words, languages, concepts. 
During the fieldwork, a participant told me an illustrative example. Some years before, a mainstream 
television channel filmed a documentary on women hosted at LYS, by interviewing some of them. 
The documentary turned out to be victimising the women, describing them as vulnerable and fragile. 
Women got really upset because of this narrative, and together with participants they decided to avoid 
any kind of relation with any media that would misread their experience. They decided to be the only 
ones telling their stories, as survivors and not victims.  
The other side of this relational approach to FDSAs is the risk of being emotionally overwhelmed. 
Relational boundaries allow to negotiate closeness and distance. Sometimes, this entanglement of 
emotions is too demanding for people approaching the space, and so it is an obstacle to participation. 
FDSAs is often a high-level intensity type of collective action, which triggers a truly committed 
engagement to the detriment of a broader and more fluid participation.  
In this section, I went through the choice of FDSA,  since  all the FSs  under  investigation  engage 
with it. The work on affects shapes FDSAs. Affects emerge as a stimulus for choosing the type of 

193 
 
direct action; as an element that shapes the action and the spaces in which it takes place; as a political 
matter of working with people normally considered users; as a tool for individual and collective 
change. 
 
7.4 Collective Action by Means of Affects: A Summary 
 
The chapter sought to explore how affects interplay with FSs at the meso level. In the previous 
chapter, I looked at FSs as structures of feelings. The work on affects emerged as: 1) a channel of 
mediation between cognition and body, 2) a tool for political elaboration, and 3) a competence in 
action. In this chapter, I have explored the third mechanism, namely the way in which affects are 
transformed into collective action. I first observed how affects modify collective action in relation to 
time and space. FSs “take their time” by challenging social time, individual expectation of life paths, 
the time of social movements, neoliberal time. Through the mediation of affects, FSs develop a 
different use of time. This skill not only transforms strategies and tactics, but also allows participants 
to measure their involvement according to the emotions they experience, and in this way it transforms 
the potential for political participation and collective action.  
The mediation of affects also modifies the perception of space. Participants often reported perceiving 
the FS as a home. This assonance may seem striking, both with respect to the dichotomy between 
public and private space, and with respect to how the gender regime produced the home as a social 
space for women. Yet, because of a number of elements related to working on affects – the work 
itself, the construction of relational ties, the rituals of everyday life – participants come to perceive 
the political space as home. This symbolic and affective association breaks the public/private and 
rational/emotional dichotomy, to unlock the potential of hybrid places in which to experiment with 
cognitive and bodily practices. Because a structure of feelings that alludes to a sense of homeliness 
is produced and perceived in the FSs, participants feel a heightened potential for action. In this sense, 
the transformation of affects in relation to time and space not only modifies the forms of action, but 
also the agency of participants.  
The chapter goes on to analyse in detail how affects are made into action within FSs. To better 
understand this, I looked at the repertoire of action, the production of codes and knowledge, and 
feminist direct social action. In the case of action repertoires, it was clear how, depending on the type 
of composition, structure of feelings and ideology, goals and strategies are set. Regardless of these 
differences, all FSs show a correspondence between the structure of feelings and the definition of 
forms of collective action. The more collective action is consistent with the work on affects, the more 
effective the type of collective action is. This work is combined with that on codes and knowledge. 
As analysed in the previous chapters, the choice to come to terms with the emotional dimension 

194 
 
debunks a long tradition of separation between passions and interests that is at the origin of capitalism, 
from the Renaissance onwards. The work on emotions is therefore a work that not only modifies the 
action, but also the symbolic paradigm, the horizon of meaning of reference. Such a profound change, 
which challenges the roots of the contemporary economic and social system, requires an equally 
profound work on codes, symbols, and knowledge. From a historical point of view, feminism has 
always referred to the symbolic challenge against a male-based world. This work is about language, 
imagery, memory, history. The construction of alternative archives of feelings allows historically 
removed  subjects – women,  lesbians,  trans, and  non-binary  people – to  elaborate  their  own 
representation and to preserve it, thus making it concrete. FSs, being also physical spaces, allow this 
work of reflection and archive to consolidate, laying the foundations and the frame of reference for 
the daily work on affects.  
Lastly, I explored feminist direct social action, which all of the spaces included in the research pursue 
in some form. Again, the mediation of affects allows for the construction of action, the relationships 
with users, and the results of action. 
This chapter aimed not only at describing the mechanism of affects as a competence in action, but 
also to analyse what this mechanism produces. Observing the work on affects and the work of affects 
allows us to analyse the potential for collective action. The starting point is that the emotional sphere 
is also often removed from the action of social movements. Consciously and continuously taking it 
on was a choice of feminist movements, of which FSs are a contemporary manifestation. Learning to 
reflect  on  affects  and  emotions  provides  not  only  descriptive  elements,  but  also  tools.  What  are 
emotions good for? What do they allow to do? Emotions work as "compasses." They show the starting 
point,  and  therefore  why  we  live  certain  degrees  of  intensity,  certain  affects.  They  help  us  to 
understand the social structures that surround us. But they also show the direction in which we can 
go. It is a direction that changes, that shifts, depending on our starting point and our orientation. The 
compass allows us to plan our journey, to organise it effectively, because it always keeps us informed 
of our direction and orientation. We can consider affects and emotions in the same way. 
They  not  only tell  more  about  us,  but  when  understood  they  also  help  in  orientation.  Their  use 
transforms the path, the strategies to face it, the medium, and long-term goals. Like the compass, 
emotions transform the capacities to face the journey. The latter, in the case of social movements, is 
collective action: the way it is negotiated, processed, put into practice. Thus, emotions not only 
provide information about the starting point, but also about political orientation. They increase the 
capacity for individual participation, the consistency with the structure of feelings, and therefore the 
potential of collective action.

8. Paths of Participants 
 
 
8.1 Introduction  
 
The body is the primary medium of all communication. (Melucci 1989: 115) 
  
The ice-breaking activity of the focus group we did at CS was intended to unveil the roots of the name 
of participants. They were invited to choose a picture among a deck of cards and to explain their 
name. One of them opted for a card with a pair of shoes, since, she said, “I always thought of my 
name as a journey. Because my real name is Giovanna, but no one calls me like this, all the people 
call me Nina. And I always have to explain why my name is Nina. So Nina is my journey, it is my 
grievance” (Focus Group IIIRA transcription, Rome, 18-12-19).  
As the participant sketched out her name as a journey, I will do so by focusing on the participants’ 
path of engaging in FSs. It is a “journey” bound up with affects (Gregg and Seigworth 2010, Massumi 
2015, Deleuze 2010), where women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary subjects, in a gendered social 
structure  (Taylor  1999,  Blee  1998),  change  their  life  paths  (McAdam  1999,  Peltola,  Milkie  and 
Presser 2004, Masclet 2016). This chapter aims at explaining that the work on affects strengthens the 
individual’s path and increases the potential for action through a cognitive and bodily liberation.  
In  their  work  on  biographical  outcomes  and  long-term  activism,  Fillieule  and  Niveu  claim  that 
“individual actors are largely absent from social movements research” (2019: 1) or, in Jasper’s words, 
“the biographical dimension of protest cries out for exploration” (1997: 214). Part of the fieldwork 
of this research was focused upon participation in FSs, from the perspective of participants.  
 
The Research Questions  
This chapter looks at individual actors – whom I call participants (both as participants in the research 
and as part of the FSs) – and how their path is intertwined with the FS they belong to. What function 
do emotions play in their path to politicisation? How does the discovery of the collective work on 
emotions modify individual agency? What does the political work on emotions produce in the long 
term at the individual level? This chapter seeks to understand the work on the nature, effects, and 
intensity of affects at the micro level, and above all it aims to understand the use that individual actors 
make of acquired emotional awareness. What do affects allow to do, once they are named? What does 
the  awareness  of  the  self and  of  the  social  structures  one  experiences  entail?  How  does  the 
mobilisation of affects influence the internal dynamics among individual actors in FSs? 

197 
 
 
In order to try to answer these questions, I will follow the participants' paths from their first contact 
with the FS. The first part will therefore be dedicated to mobilisation at the individual level, feminist 
socialisation, and the performing of roles as mediations between the self and the political space. The 
second part, following the individual paths, will specifically look at the work on emotions and affect. 
Finally, I will explore the way in which in the long term the work on affects produces consequences 
on individual actors. 
 
From the Mobilisation Process to Feminist Socialisation 
How and why do people get involved in FSs? Social movement scholars elaborated on the role of 
networks (della Porta 1988, Fernandez and McAdam 1989), identity (Taylor and Whittier 1992, 
Polletta  and  Jasper  2001),  demands  and  supply  (Klandermans  2004),  framing  and  ideology 
(McAdam, McCarthy and Zald 1996, Snow 2004), and emotions (Gould 2003, Goodwin, Jasper and 
Polletta  2001,  Taylor  2013).  All  these  factors  emerged  from the participants’ willingness and 
opportunity to engage with FSs. Yet, participants claim for an “impalpable” (Grosz 2004) factor that 
coalesces the other dimensions, and that was an inner part of the recruitment process: the one of 
affect. As Ahmed argues in her model of affect as contact, “we are affected by ‘what’ we come into 
contact with. In other words, emotions are directed to what we come into contact with: they move us 
‘toward’ and ‘away’ from those objects” (2006: 2). By referring to the Women’s Studies classroom, 
Ahmed (2004) suggests that the politics of teaching is bound up with wonder: “a sense of surprise 
about how it is that the world has come to take the shape that it has. [...] Wonder opens up a collective 
space, by allowing the surfaces of the world to make an impression, as they become see-able or feel-
able as surfaces” (182). The process of bewilderment, hesitation, and undoing of what was taken for 
granted is part of the students’ awareness raising. The classroom is a controlled example which allows 
for a spatialisation of the analysis. Similarly, FSs allow for a spatialisation of the mobilisation process, 
bound up with wonder. Women and other subjects do not become feminists out of wonder. However, 
this affect increases “the historicity of forms of life to emerge – in the perception of the intimacy of 
norms and forms” (Ahmed 2004: 183). Not surprisingly, participants mention the feeling of “hunger” 
as an adjunct of their choice to engage with. This urge is consequent to the surprise for a world where 
certain feelings (unease, exclusion, alienation, oddity) are not an individual responsibility, but rather 
the result of social inequalities (Piccone Stella and Saraceno 1996). Passions flow from one body to 
the other, and they become a capacity according to the way bodies are affected by other bodies 
(Deleuze 2010). When wonder, “hunger,” and individual availability to political participation are 
consistent, the process of mobilisation begins.  

198 
 
Becoming  feminist  is  a path:  on  one  hand,  it  entails  political  socialisation;  on  the  other,  the 
development of certain skills, and roles. Studies on political socialisation have only recently turned 
their attention to adult socialisation (Sapiro 1989), by focusing on social movements as explicit and 
implicit socialisation agents (Fillieule 2013). I will focus on feminist political socialisation as “the 
gradual development of the individual’s own particular and idiosyncratic views of the political world” 
(Filieulle 2013: 1). McAdam developed the concept of cognitive liberation (1982) in the sense of a 
common definition that subjects learn to give to a certain situation in terms of injustice. This step is 
necessary in the formation of collective subjects, but it concerns the cognitive level, ignoring the way 
in  which  emotions  and  the  body  are  involved  in  the  individual  liberation  process.  The  feminist 
movement  has  historically  built  on  these  two  elements,  affect  and  body,  the  attribution  of  new 
meanings to the given situation, and thus the preconditions for its transformation. In contrast to the 
tradition of the Western rational subject, which also inspires the concept of cognitive liberation, the 
feminist movement proposes a liberation that acknowledges the affects’ adaptive role in enabling 
individuals to survive. 
The conquest of self-consciousness, as a ground for political involvement, is a process through which 
activists re-define their approach to the body, their view of the social world, through an analysis of 
affect and emotions. By challenging preadult learning, activists pursue a work of self-awareness in 
order to name emotions – such as discomfort, pain, fear, anger – related to discrimination and gender 
inequality. Affects have an adaptive function: they signal a danger, a need, a malaise, an expectation. 
On the other hand, emotions are always culturally constructed: acting on emotions enables to modify 
the meanings that a certain order of discourse assigns to a certain situation, a certain life condition 
and  role  expectation.  Following  Fillieule’s  assumption  that  “neither  childhood  nor  adolescence 
adequately prepare mature adults for all the contingencies with which they have to cope over their 
lifetimes”  (2013:  2),  we  can  consider  FSs  as  fields  of  learning  and  changing  of  oneself’s 
underdeveloped features, such as affect and emotions and one’s transformative potential.  
 
Mobilising Affects  
For a long time, social movement studies disregarded emotions and passions as an inner part of 
political action (Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta 2001: 1-2). In the last two decades, a new stream of 
literature highlighted the sphere of emotions as a tool for understanding political action, beyond those 
theories that consider emotions purely connected to irrationality (Taylor 1995, Hercus 1999, Gould 
2004, Goodwin and Jasper 2009). Feminist theorists, such as Sara Ahmed (2004), pursued a reflection 
on emotions not “as psychological states, but as social and cultural practices” (9). As reported in the 
literature  review,  further  elaborations  have gone  beyond  emotions  as  individual-based  angles  to 

199 
 
understand  collective  action.  Affects  have  been  considered  as  a  proxy  to  analyse  the  historical 
background that shapes certain meanings and reactions to bodies/objects/surfaces, and to analyse the 
mutual process of “be[ing] affected by” and “affect[ing]” (Ahmed 2004, 2006). “I mean by affection 
the affections of the body by which the power of action of the body itself is increased or diminished, 
indulged or impeded, and at the same time the ideas of these affections” (2019: 236-7). With these 
words  Spinoza  describes  the  relationship  between  the  body  and  affects.  In  his  analysis,  positive 
passions are those that increase the power of action, and negative ones those that decrease it. In his 
framework, the two main passions are joy (positive) and sadness (negative). From these two primary 
passions, he derives dozens of others, through a precise geometry of human passions. Through the 
work on positive and negative passions, FSs offer participants an apprenticeship that enables them to 
understand the nature of emotions and their use, including political use. Understanding emotional 
mechanisms transforms the participants' paths, their life choices, their expectations. 
Among other positive emotions, the erotic has been historically explored by feminist theory for its 
role in feminist politics (Rubin 2007, Wittig 2019, Paoletti 2011). The discovery of the pleasure to 
spend time with other women, the possibility to give value to this feeling, and the act of withdrawing 
from male desire is considered as the basis of consciousness rising and liberation. In his work on new 
social movements, Melucci argues about the “change in the representation of sexuality; possibility to 
choose beyond expectations and traditional roles. How and where can we make room for the erotic 
‘creation’ that replaces procreation?” (1989: 151). The erotic structure strengthens feminist bonds. 
Feminist spaces enhance a political understanding of sexuality, by rejecting the separation between 
the political and the private field. Women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people are allowed to name 
their feelings and unknown desires, and, potentially, their attachment to others other than men. In her 
work on the lesbian continuum, Rich (1980) argues about a ladder of feelings – from less intense, 
such  as  a  generalised  erotic,  to  stronger  feelings, such  as  women-to-women  lesbian  love – that 
connects women to other women.  
Socialisation and cognitive  and  bodily  liberation  occur  with  the  others.  Networks  among  social 
movements’  participants  are  a  proxy  to  understand  the  mobilisation  process  and  long-term 
participation in social movements (della Porta 1988). Klandermans (1997) and others elaborate on 
the  social  psychology  of  mobilisations,  which  means  the  mechanisms  that  favoured  people’s 
participation through instrumentality, identity, and ideology. By analysing the clandestine political 
organisations recruitment processes, della Porta (1995) found out the relevance of personal ties, but 
also their intensity and high quantity. Affective ties in high-risk activism ensure a base of loyalty, 
friendship, and  cognitive  assonance that strengthen  people’s  will  to  engage  with  clandestine 
organisations.  Scholars  working  on  feminist  movements  mention  the  role  of  ties  in  women’s 

200 
 
availability to participate into groups and organisation (Taylor and Whittier 1999).  
However, the literature on social movements lacks an understanding of affective ties as a core feature 
of social movements. Social movement scholars working on feminist movements, as well, did not 
fully embrace the epistemological challenge of those movements, and neither their innovation in 
knowledge production, rather engaging with classical concepts to understand new social movements. 
How do affective ties ground feminist politics? Which affects are involved in such ties?  
Consciousness rising groups laid the foundations for feminist thought. Women gathered in small 
groups to tell their stories (Sarachild 1977). The process of telling individual stories and locating 
them into social inequalities produces a concatenation of bodies and minds among women (Massumi 
2015). In this concatenation, affects flow. Fear, discomfort, guilt, anger, are named and transformed 
into  collective  action.  “Relationships  are  really  part  of  our  politics.  And  this  is  the  essential 
difference” (IIIR7, CS, 30). Beyond a strategic use of affects, they bind women to one another. For a 
long time, feminist theory elaborated on the concept of women-to-women relationships as the basis, 
the resource, the prefigurative site of politics (hooks 1991, Bono and Kempt 1991, Cavarero and 
Restaino 2002, Fraire 2002). It is still missing a cross-fertilisation between social movement studies 
and feminist theory, that would be capable to engage with epistemological innovations brought about 
by feminist movements, and to broaden the scope of analysis of social movements. This research 
aims to fill this gap.  
As much as affects disclose the potential for action, they can also decrease it. The analysis of internal 
conflict will shed light on the dark side of affective ties, and on the consequences of openly addressing 
such negative emotions that bring to conflicts, or ignoring them.  
 
Affects in the Long Run 
Awareness of affects, like a stone thrown into water, produces concentric waves that go beyond the 
individual stone. Through the analysis of biographical outcomes, I will try to see how the work on 
affect modifies the relationship with the self, the biographical path, gender construction and sexuality, 
life and work choices, the family, emotional relationships, and life expectations. 
My argument is that the work on affects increases the potential for collective action at the individual 
level.  Affects  are  explored  as  a  means  of  political  participation,  community  building  process, 
trajectories of engagement and disengagement. The conscious work on affects has transformative 
effects. In this section, I will look at the process at the micro level of actors and relationships among 
actors.

8.2 Becoming Feminist   
 
 
8.2.1 Mobilising for Feminism  
 
And so I came into Lucha and I did this [anti-violence] course of several months that... I would say that it 
turned me upside down. Because it was like I waited for my whole life to enter in there. (IIR5, LYS, 33)  
 
All the participants remember the first time they stepped into the space, or that they approached other 
feminists, because of the feelings associated with that moment. Sensations mark the beginning of 
individual mobilisation, and transform the subject in relation to the FS, to herself and to the social 
context. I will call the beginning of feminist engagement “watershed event” (cfr 8.3.1). With some 
temporal shift, the engagement with FSs and the participation in feminist movement often overlap. 
Several factors are embedded in the individual’s mobilisation, and they interplay with affects. In this 
section,  I  will  explore  this  nexus  through  several  factors:  the  socio-historical  context;  family; 
socialisation; political background.  
Depending on the age-cohort, activists inhabited different socio-historical contexts (Fillieule and 
Niveau 2019). For women that were part of the movement in the 1970s and that are part of the CID, 
FSs are a generational matter. The 1970s have been suffused by an affective structure (Taylor 1995), 
that Bracke calls “counter-community of emotions” (2012: 223). This structure fostered women’s 
disposition to reflect on themselves, to meet other women, and to embed feminism as an habitus 
(Bracke 2014). The affective structure was so powerful and diffuse that activists blurred their own 
birth with “the birth” of political participation. As a CID participants that has engaged in feminist 
networks since the 1970s recalls, “I was born there... in the feminist movement of the Seventies” 
(IR4, CID, 70). Even if they were not directly part of the space, they shared the generational feeling 
of being part of an historical moment, of a collective feeling. Another CID participant, who was not 
formally part of the feminist movement at that time, remembers the feeling of a generalised affective 
structure: “I belong to a generation that has been involved in the feminism of the Seventies. I often 
went to the Governo Vecchio [the first house of women in Rome in 1976] but I wasn’t a proper 
militant  in  some  group  [...].  It  was  my  space  of  freedom  in  a  way.  I  thought  I  needed  it  as  a 
compensation for  the strong  male  world  that  I  lived  in”  (IR5,  CID,  73).  As  a  consequence, 
contemporary activism is the result of a long-term participation.  
Other participants mobilised for FSs in different socio-historical contexts. When they join FSs in 
phases of latency of the movement, other factors are more prominent, such as family, socialisation, 
or political background.  
Family models underwent a profound change in the 1960s, as a result of economic prosperity, the 

202 
 
mobilisations of 1968, and the advent of feminism. Some of the interviewees claim that they have 
“always been feminist” (IIR6, LYS, 35) because of their family background. Family contributes to 
the development of adaptive emotions, such as fear, desire, or discontent. It is a site of growth and 
learning, but also of wounds and discomfort. In this sense, family enhances the creation of an affective 
structure that the individual has to deal with, through adapting, moving away, or transforming the 
structure. As a LYS participant recounts, her experience with her family of origin not only shaped 
her socialisation, but put her through a “biographical re-evaluation” thanks to the engagement with 
the FS she is part of:   
I was born in one of the more sexist places on earth. I came from a space where I underwent 
harassment since childhood. A lot of stereotypes shaped my life as a girl. I am an orphan and I 
grew up with a single mother. And in [her region] a single mother surviving without a man is 
unthinkable. The only way to survive and raise your child is being a slut. And the consequence is 
that also the daughter is considered a slut. [...] When I say that I always have been feminist is 
because in this space [LYS] I made a biographic re-evaluation. I looked back at my past enriching 
it with a new view. (IIR1, LYS, 37) 
 
Political participation is the result of feelings that bound up early individual socialisation (della Porta 
1995, Passy 2001). Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta call them affective bonds, that “give us our basic 
orientations toward the world, especially telling us what we care most deeply about” (2004: 418). 
Affects orient individuals’ willingness to participate. Approaching a FS emerges as a way to build 
the inner self beyond loneliness and bewilderment, both as a woman and, often, as a lesbian woman. 
Women searching for friends, comrades, lovers, but also homeliness, come closer to the feminist 
community in order to broaden their relational field (McAdam 1988). As an interviewee of the CS 
develops, “I began attending a squat in Rome, because I was bored with life, and I needed to meet 
other women, other lesbians, other females, that in a way share my feelings” (IIIR4, CS, 31). As 
Passy argues, “networks play a multiple role in the process leading to participation and that they 
intervene at different moments along this process” (2000: 2). However, the integration of structuralist 
and rationalist theories often overlooks affects. Networks help to build one’s own identity, but also 
to  find  a  proper  dimension  (Polletta  2001).  The  new  context  increases  strength,  empowerment, 
autonomy, beyond the usual life where – as women, lesbians, trans people, racialised people, poor 
people – they frequently feel lost. It gives a meaning, a life work (Taylor and Rupp 1989), a direction 
in one’s own life. As I previously developed, networks imbue the creation of transformative structures 
of feelings where new meanings are created at the individual level. An interviewee of LYS elaborates 
on this, saying, “some people entered in my life beyond whatever type of political questions or 
collective goals and practices. They are people with whom we built a real affective tie. And this has 
intensified everything else” (II2, LYS, 37).  

203 
 
As well as with networks, socialisation is bound up with violence (Pain 1991). The perception of 
structural violence (Barone and Bonu forthcoming) is a sticky emotion which shapes the individuals’ 
everyday life, and paths in the urban and social space. What women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary 
people perceive they can do is constrained by the risk of bad consequences. This feeling of fear or 
unease fosters the search for a shelter. Participants approach FSs in order to build skills and to achieve 
resources  to  face  violence,  both  at  the  symbolic  and  material  level,  as  an  interviewee  of  LYS 
develops:  
And then suddenly something changed in me, [...] around me a lot of women and friends undergo 
gender violence. [...] A lot of situations that made me think: it is enough, I can no longer accept 
this situation, I have to do something. [...] So the first thing I did was the [anti-violence] course. 
[...] I precisely remember that I came back home and I was enthusiastic. [...] It was the breather 
that I needed. [...] And while I did the course I realised I had a mad desire to know more, to live 
the space [LYS] more. [...] At the end of the course a girl said: “it is like I searched for my whole 
life for a dress and I realised that here there is this dress for me.” (IIR5, LYS, 33) 
 
The thaumaturgic work of FSs opens up new possibilities for women that saw their lives devastated 
by violence. They elaborate on the rebuilding of their own life on a different ground. Emotions have 
an adaptive role: fear, rage and discontent allow women to materially survive. In FSs, participants 
learn the use of emotions, not only as intuitions, but as concrete tools for survival and to engage with 
a good life. As a woman that survived gender-based violence recounts, she underwent many types of 
violence, but then when she arrived at LYS, “slowly, with the common life here [at LYS], with 
activities, it happened that I came back to life” (IIR9, LYS, 66).  
The last factor under investigation is the political background. Some of the interviewees got involved 
into  feminist  spaces  through  radical  leftist  groups,  the  right  to housing movement,  student 
movements, health movements, or other social centres, searching for a different type of politics. Then, 
as an interviewee of the CS says, “we started to feel an urge for a space that would be feminist and 
nothing else” (IIIR2, CS, 36). They call “mixed spaces” political groups or spaces with both men and 
women, where feminism is not the priority. The opening of political opportunity (such as a new cycle 
of mobilisation) discloses the possibility for the creation of feminist-only spaces: 
All of us working at receptions of the right to housing movement started understanding that there 
was a huge number of requests from women because of a situation of violence. [...] We were not 
feminists, [...] we didn’t think about it, we didn’t take a path of consciousness and awareness. 
But then the re-emergence of the [feminist] movement [...] opens a space of thought where there 
was none, in the mixed movement. (IIR3, LYS, 43) 
 
Mixed movements are considered as lacking both for political reasons – hierarchies, sexism, implicit 
normativity, gender blindness – and for relational reasons. When feminism arises as the main source 
of  identification,  it  seems  incompatible  with  a  full-covering  politics.  FSs  are  not  separate  for 
biological reasons, but for political ones: there, feminism it the priority.

8.2.2 Feminist Political Socialisation  
 
My relation with the feminist movement has been the conquest of the consciousness’s dimension as a crucial 
dimension of politics. (IR6, CID, 67) 
 
What  is  “the  conquest  of  the  consciousness’s dimension?”  How  does  the  dissection  of  affects 
transform the relation with the self, and the relation between the self and the rest? In this section, I 
will  explore  consciousness  rising  as  a  site  of  political  socialisation, through the  development  of 
emotional capabilities, on one hand, and of practical skills, on the other.  
In the previous section, I went through the way mobilisation of individuals in FSs is bound up with 
affects.  Once  the  mobilisation  process  in  the  FSs  has  begun,  participants  develop  emotional 
competences that transform their relationship with the political space, with the self (body-mind), with 
the social structure. As the opening quote shows, the process occurs through the acquisition of the 
consciousness  dimension  as  a  crucial  dimension  of  politics.  With  other  participants,  individuals 
develop their understanding on the cultural and social foundations of emotions, and on the political 
use of emotions. Through political socialisation, participants learn to manage self-confidence and 
their individual potential for action that goes beyond the walls of the FSs. As an interviewee of the 
CS says, “when I was not there [in the space] I felt on me all the power of that experience, in another 
country far away from here” (IIIR7, CS, 30).  
By drawing attention to perceptions, feelings, and emotions, participants elaborate new relationships 
with the self and the rest. The process requires to fathom what has been attached, what is taken for 
granted, and what we involuntarily continue to reproduce, i.e. an affective structure that socialisation 
has consolidated up to that point. In this sense, it requires participants “to eradicate what relies inside 
you” (IIR1, LYS, 37). The structure of emotions that participants have to deal with is part of the 
gender regime (Connell 1995). The way bodies, objects, and spaces affect participants, and the way 
participants affect the social world, is a field of interactions that become through FSs a field of 
consciousness. On one hand, participants engage with their feelings, that are not the madness of an 
individual, but the result of a system of unfair social norms towards women, queer, racialised, and 
poor  people  (Connell  1995).  On  the  other  hand,  affects  are  not  a  result  of  irrationality,  low 
intelligence,  frivolity,  or  of  the  private  sphere,  but  they  are  the  subject  of  collective  action. 
Participants elaborate on their own life and perceptions as a ground for collective action. By naming 
the persistence of the male-structured social world (Nicholas and Agius 2017), activists disentangle 
affects related to everyday life in a world that is not made for them. The threshold of tolerance of a 
male-based world becomes lower. As an example, with regard to the use in Italian of the universalistic 

205 
 
masculine gender marker in all situations, an interviewee of LYS explains that “now to me it makes 
a difference. [...] I realise that is a removal. If I am in a space and someone includes me in this tutti 
[masculine of “all”] without saying tutte [feminine of “all”] I feel the removal.” (IIR1, LYS, 37). 
Ahmed (2006) proposes a conceptualisation of orientation as a way to find one’s own way in a 
changing  world.  As  she  argues,  a  phenomenology  of  orientation  is  worthwhile  to  grasp  “the 
importance of lived experience, the intentionality of consciousness, the significance of nearness or 
what is ready-to-hand, and the role of repeated and habitual actions in shaping bodies and worlds” 
(2006: 2). Participants learn the orientation of emotions imbued in a social and cultural structure, and 
they learn to orient their emotions toward the development of the potential for action and a good life.  
The  “training”  to  become  feminists  in  FSs  is  called  into  question  by  most  participants,  as  an 
acquisition of knowledge, skills, capacities to deal with their own background and present time. The 
process  allows  to  develop  emotional,  professional,  and  practical  skills,  often  constrained  by  a 
gendered organisation of social roles. An interviewee of LYS explains that she became competent 
“on a hundred aspects. Well, I became an anti-violence operator, a certified cultural mediator, and I 
did it here. As well as we know how to prepare a pint of beer, repaint a wall, change the bathroom 
drain”  (IIR3,  LYS,  45).  As  McAdam  showed  (1989),  social  movements  are  spaces  of 
professionalisation. By managing service provisions, participants become anti-violence operators, 
psychotherapists and psychiatrists specifically trained on gender-based violence. Participants realise 
their political participation strengthens their expertise, and thus their capacity in the job market: “I 
understood that in the job market I had a lot of competences that I didn’t think would have been 
useful,  such  as  managing  groups, teamwork,  or  also  technical  such  as  writing  calls  or  projects, 
interacting with institutions” (IIR8). Or, in the case of CS, the fortuitous presence of poles encouraged 
a  self-managed  course  of  pole  dance,  leading  some  of  them  to  become  certified  teachers  of  the 
discipline. Feminist socialisation brings about professionalisation, but it also changes job professions. 
Direct social actions developed by FSs broaden skills and protocols of the field of anti-violence 
provisions. Institutional tools are not enough to cope with the needs coming from the social world, 
and so provisions from below develop new knowledge, protocols, and tools to deal with that.  
The gender regime (Connell 1985) works through norms: the appropriate behaviours and feelings 
constrain what individuals can do. On one hand, it is a practical traineeship, on the other an emotional 
one. As Walby argues (2004), the gender regime shapes a complex matrix of spaces, institutions, 
relationships, by prescribing gender performances, roles, skills, and norms people should adequate 
to.  The  transgression  of  these  norms  creates  rifts  in  the  social  order  by  introducing  unforeseen 
behaviours and bodies. Feminist apprenticeship is a gender regime challenger. It works through the 
questioning  of  norms  and  appropriate  behaviours,  by  creating  alternative  forms  of living (Yates 

206 
 
2020).  On  one  hand,  it  is  a  practical  traineeship,  on  the  other  an  emotional  one.  The  two  are 
interwoven.  
From a practical point of view, activists develop skills which are usually considered as falling under 
the male domain, such as technical skills, plumbing, electrical, and so on. By dismantling gendered 
skills and the genderisation of human capacities, activists develop toolkits to survive in the physical 
space without male intervention. They develop skills to relate with different settings, institutions, and 
actors. The risk of eviction and the management of service provisions make activists aware of their 
multilevel skills and their ability to negotiate in different arenas, as an interviewee of LYS explains:  
Legal issues, administrative issues... we know how to write a project, how to prepare a budget, 
with  no  schooling on  that.  I  mean,  we  did  it  through  practice,  slamming  in  our  face,  putting 
ourselves  to  disposition.  [...]  The  capacity  to  go  around  the  world  and  talk  in  front  of  the 
commission of the European Council. I mean... a series of competences that we built in here [at 
LYS]. To talk with the Rando McFuckFace [Signor Stracazzo dei Tali] at the same level. Because 
I know as many things as you know. Despite the fact that you are a fucking manager. (IIR3, LYS, 
45)   
 
The acquisition of skills and expertise increases self-confidence, the feeling of individual power. It 
boosts positive emotions and the expansion of the participants’ agency and confidence to act. Thus, 
it increases the potential for action.  
The creation of new affective structures developed within FSs by participants often absorbs their 
whole  life.  Totalising  militancy  is  a  common  experience  for  them, who  can hardly  balance the 
political engagement and their own life. As a CID interviewee argues, “it is a life that takes all your 
time... you have friends, politics, militancy... I would say that is my whole life” (IR1, CID, 58). 
Taking the time for themselves is also a process of self-consciousness that frequently comes with the 
experience.  
 
8.2.3 Performing a Role, Finding a Place  
 
The first activity of the focus group at Cagne Sciolte’s space started with a question: if you were a 
part of this space, which part would you be? Each of the participants was invited to draw or represent 
that part. They had at their disposal papers, markers, colored pencils, Play-Doh, glitter, and so on. 
Then we went in front of each part of the space and they explained why they would be that part. The 
activity was intended to unveil the participants’ attachment to the space and the affective roots of 
their  individual  engagement.  The  choice  was  consistent  with the  theoretical  and  epistemological 
approach of the research, that considers affects as a medium between bodies, spaces, and norms, as a 
way through which participants are affected by and affect spaces, objects and other people.  
During the focus group, one of them brought us in the mezzanine, where the privé was – since the 

207 
 
space used to be a nightclub before the occupation – and she told her story:  
I choose to associate myself with this space because I spent plenty of hours here. I spent a lot of 
hours removing the moquette and tearing down the walls, and this space helped me to find a 
collocation. By doing this I felt I was part of this project. [...] It made me feel that I had sense in 
this space. (Focus Group IIIRA transcription, Rome, 18-12-19) 
 
Building on this quote, we can see how affects work in several ways. First, political participation is 
an affective journey where activists perceive, feel, and elaborate on their emotions. As I addressed in 
the former section, political socialisation through emotions changes the individuals’ relation with the 
self and the rest. The engagement with FSs is built upon the affective work of participants with 
objects, spaces, other activists. Participants find their collocation through an active interaction with 
the space, and this interaction is mediated by affect. The collocation and role help participants to 
consciously elaborate on affects, by ordering positive and negative feelings related to the space. 
Affect draws boundaries within the space. Certain affects made participants more or less part of the 
space, and affects shape the individual perception about collective action. In this section, I will further 
elaborate on the aspects of roles and boundaries, mediated by affects.  
While doing participant observation, I soon understood that “roles” and “collocation” are a matter of 
organisation  and  legitimisation  in  FSs.  The  need  for  a  collocation  arises  from  affects:  women, 
lesbians, trans, and non-binary people are used to feel out of place, and spaces and organisations 
produce an initial bewilderment in people who join. The aspiration to join feminist ideas and actions 
goes with individual feelings of uncertainty and disorientation. As Ahmed shows, “emotions shape 
what bodies do in the present, or how they are moved by the objects they approach. [...] Emotions 
involve such affective forms of (re)orientation. It is not just that bodies are moved by the orientations 
they have; rather, the orientations we have toward others shape the contours of space by affecting 
relations of proximity and distance between bodies” (2006: 2). Performing a role mediates these 
negative feelings by giving a sense, a pertinence of the presence within the FS. Whether spaces claim 
to be completely open – and they relatively are – there are always invisible structures that shape their 
social organisation. Boundaries work through affective signs (Ahmed 2004) that people instinctively 
perceive.  
In FSs’ daily life there are participants, people who join single events, women who live in the space 
for longer or shorter periods of time (as in anti-violence shelter), workers, curious people. All of them, 
depending on their intersectional positionality (Hills Collins 1991), are differently affected by objects, 
spaces and other people, and differently engage with the structures of feelings of FSs. As an example, 
women hosted at LYS are usually much more open, regardless of who you are and what you are doing 
there. If participants have a more structured political socialisation and way of understanding implicit 
rules in the space, women hosted live the space as a welcoming place, free from other types of 

208 
 
superstructures. Affects and responses to affects are contextual. An anti-violence operator may seek 
the respect of her comrades, but feel inadequate because of her age compared to older women who 
might ask for her help. Roles are therefore not fixed and unchangeable, but are shaped by the context 
and the moment.  
Roles, as well, depend on the structure and type of spaces. Affects interplay with objects and spaces, 
and  this  interaction  shapes  the  participants’ availability  for  participation.  If  the  CID  is  managed 
through a hierarchical structure, others, such as the CS, are managed through a weekly assembly that 
is supposed to be fully horizontal. Differences in the type of management define different types of 
implicit rules and roles. In spaces such as the CID, this feeling arises from the internal setting. Being 
part of an association is the link “to have a closer relation with the House” (IR, CID, 69). Other spaces 
present  less  structured  organisation,  but  in  any  case  the  process  of  defining  roles  recurs. “Well, 
[becoming the secretary] it located me. At least you say: okay, I do this, this is my piece, and so my 
contribution located me [in the space]” (IIR1, LYS, 37). Roles are also frustrating, when they are 
perceived  as  difficult  to  change,  as  a  LYS  interviewee  explains:  “until  last  year  I  did  internal 
managing assembly... I did them for many years [...]. Then at some point I said: comrades, I don’t 
want to do that anymore. I don’t like it anymore, and the mechanisms that occurred in that assembly 
made  me  feel  uncomfortable”  (IIIR7,  LYS,  35).  Frustration  is  triggered  by  the  burden  of 
responsibility.  Activists  managing enormous tasks – such  as  helping  women  escaping  violence, 
organising a  shelter  and  so  on – and  often understaffed,  feel  overwhelmed.  “There  were tough 
moments,  because  we  had  all  of  this  on  our  shoulders.  We  didn’t  handle  this,  all  of  us  doing 
everything, it was crazy.. [...] And then of course you find yourself not doing something very well, 
inevitably, because you cannot do everything. And so this was another work... to distribute... always 
based on individual desire” (IIR4, LYS, 53). 
Although the analysis demonstrates the persistence of organisational structures and role definition 
even in spaces that elaborate alternative forms of free spaces (Polletta 2001), participants assign a 
fundamental role to desire in defining their role and place in the space. Even in professionalised roles, 
what each one can do is understood to be linked to what she feels she wants to do, to her life trajectory.  
 
8.3 Mobilising Affect   
 
 
8.3.1 Emotions and Affect into Action 
 
The process of joining FSs is bound up with affect. Mobilisation, socialisation, and role acquisition 
are informed by the challenge to a certain affective structure, and by the construction of alternative 

209 
 
structures of feelings that increase the potential for action at the individual level. FSs elaborate their 
strategic action from a work on individual and collective affects. How do affects move, how are they 
tackled, what do they produce? What political use of affects is elaborated in the FSs? What does the 
processing of causes, consequences, and uses of emotions produce on an individual level?  
The  process  of  joining  FSs  is  bound  up  with  feelings  of  dissatisfaction,  anger,  loneliness, 
misunderstanding, which are consequent to the gender regime (Connel 1995, Walby 2004). Some 
affects, such as fear, are the result of a social background that produced women and non-conforming 
subjectivities as “out-of-place,” as prey, as less-than-human (Butler 2016). Activism is permeated 
with  empathy,  love,  frustration,  the  erotic.  Disengagement  occurs  out  of  pain,  loss,  disillusion, 
rejection. Through emotions, FSs develop their own framing, understand social inequalities, define 
strategies for action. The understanding of collective affects allows FSs to increase their capacity and 
impact. When fear, anger, and anxiety get into collective elaboration, they change into the “dignity 
of living my life as it is.” In the following quote, a CS’s participant reports the FSs’ work on emotions, 
and how they are made into individual change: 
It is the acquisition of a sort of expertise in staying in the world. [...] I do not remember the last 
time I felt unsafe. I think this is the outcome of a path of acceptance of a quite extreme life 
compared to what is considered a right way to live. I spent so many years of my life trapped with 
anger, and severe anxiety. Even only to go out. Because I had internalised the feeling of going out 
without knowing if you would be able to go back home. Partly because you are a woman, partly 
because you are lesbian, partly because Rome is a weird city, and a lot of time I tested how violent 
it can be. And at some point I made peace  with those things. Fear and anxiety disappeared. And I 
found a sort of dignity in living my life as it is. (Focus Group IIIRA transcription, Rome, 18-12-
19) 
 
The discovery of the dignity to live life as it is is a source of strength and self-confidence that increases 
the potential for action. In this section, I will tackle the micro-scale dynamics of affects, and the main 
emotions emerging from the participants’ views. According to Spinoza’s interpretation of affects, I 
will try to frame positive affects, which increase the capacity for action, and the negative ones, which 
decrease it.  
Although  it  may  seem  counter-intuitive,  the  dissection  of  positive  affects  begins  from  anger. 
Women’s  anger  has  been  historically  downgraded  as  hysteria,  madness,  or  fragile  mental  health 
(Hochshild 1975, Jasper 2011, Chemaly 2018). Because of their social role, women were precluded 
from  the  possibility  to  claim  this  feeling  as  a  political  matter.  The  1970s  feminist  movements 
reevaluated anger  as  a  legitimate  passion,  despite  the  male-based  structure  of  emotions.  “Every 
woman has a well-stocked arsenal of anger potentially useful against those oppressions, personal and 
institutional, which brought that anger into being. Focused with precision it can become a powerful 
source of energy serving progress and change” (Lorde 1984: 181). Anger comes from the perception 
of unfair living conditions. As an interviewee of CS develops, anger becomes a tool to strengthen 

210 
 
networks and to elaborate collective action: “there was anger. A lot of anger. [...] What holds us 
together is anger toward the outside world” (IIIR7, CS, 30).  
Being angry is a source of engagement and of long-term participation. The work on anger allows 
participants to retain the social meaning of this emotion and to use it as a source of political activation 
and social change, as one LYS interviewee states: “there are still too many things that made me angry 
to quit feminist politics” (IIR8, LYS, 30). FSs allow to name and to transform anger. It shifts from a 
personal disease to a political matter. As one LYS interviewee explains, the physical place allows to 
spatialise an emotion with a strong social background, and to find a political use that can really bring 
about change, for example in the field of gender-based violence. This process is not only effective 
from the point of view of collective action, but it also produces positive consequences on an individual 
level, helping participants to transform their anger into a tool for change, even in their daily lives: 
“we need a place for conveying energies coming from frustration, anger for the political system. [...] 
There is a structural lack in the fight against violence and I can’t stand it anymore. I think that if 
Lucha weren’t there anymore, allowing me to fight against this oppression, everything would be 
worse. I mean, dealing with it to a personal level, not to a political level” (IIR5, LYS, 33).  
Hate  and  anger  become  political  emotions  when  they  are  transformed  and  channelled  through 
collective  action.  Anger  can  be  performed  through  innovative  types of  public  protests.  As  an 
interviewee explains, hate is constantly reproduced against minorities, while minorities are forbidden 
to feel hate as an emotion. That is why for her, “in a period in which there is a blame on hate, claiming 
the right to have it against who is acting violence on you is important. [...] This is the aggressive 
style of Cagne Sciolte. Not giving up anger and hate against who oppresses you” (IIIR8, CS, 33). 
According to the Spinozian interpretation, anger is a positive passion as it increases the participants' 
capacity  to  act.  If  anger  affects  participants  when  they  experience  situations  of  injustice,  it  also 
becomes a source of power and a potential for action when it is channelled through collective action.  
Together with anger, participants recurrently refer to love. Spinoza claims that when joy is an affect 
experienced with the awareness of the external causes that have generated it (and therefore what one 
is “being affected by” and what one is “affecting”), that is love. Often, participants describe their 
involvement in FSs as “falling in love.” We can consider the process as a conscious work on the 
external  and  internal  causes  that  transform  the  individuals’  will  into  collective  effort.  A  LYS 
interviewee  outlines  her  experience  within  FSs  through  the  phases  of  falling  in  love,  by  linking 
politics to the repertoire of feelings of love. The threat of eviction, and so the political crisis, triggers 
feelings of protection as with regard to the beloved person: 
I love these women. I am in love with them. I know I passed all the phases of falling in love in 
that space [LYS]. Now I am in the protective phase, where I feel that the beloved thing is in 
danger and I want to save it. So I want to reject everything that goes against this love, it scares 

211 
 
me. There are moments in which it makes me cry or makes me angry. Exactly what happens when 
you deeply love someone. (IIR5, LYS, 33) 
 
What is “falling in love”? It is to progressively become fascinated by someone or something, to care 
for their existence, to be affected by the interaction  with them. The loving bond involves the entire 
community, beyond the boundaries of coupledom. As an interviewee of the CS addresses, the feeling 
of joy and love expands the perception of the self, it allows to think that “everything is possible:” 
“[The occupation] was the beginning of a huge collective romance. In the first months, it seemed 
romantic, but we truly thought that everything was possible” (IIIR10, CS, 30). The feeling of love, 
unhinged by romance and partnership, increases the feeling of the action’s potential, expands the self 
and the evaluation of its capabilities. These feelings fuel the participants, and thus their readiness for 
collective action.  
Participants draw on the grammar of romanticism to describe their relationship with space. Their link 
between political participation and the affect of love sheds light on their deconstruction of the rational 
subject, and on the work on the affective, non-rational, potentially unpredictable side that even social 
movements have historically eluded. By explaining the word “romantic,” an interviewee of the CS 
develops: “romantic because... it is beautiful, it is an utopia. A perspective, a tension, a desire, an 
emotion, a practice” (IIIR7, CS, 30).  
As well as with positive affects, political participation in a feminist space is bound up with negative 
emotions. According to Spinoza, negative emotions decrease the capacity to act. Despite efforts to 
build feminist spaces and social change, efforts often do not pay off and this generates frustration and 
sadness. The fatigue of daily politics that is not reflected can produce sadness, or disengagement. In 
some cases, this sadness is conscious of the external cause that produces it (such as institutional 
failures, hostile social norms), in others less so. When awareness is lacking or negative passions 
prevail, the sense of attachment to the space decreases and thus also participation, as well as the trust 
in a possible change. As usual, participants tell the story of their strategic choice at the individual 
level through an affective grammar. As an interviewee of LYS explains, the acknowledgment of 
negative  emotions  allows  them  to  opt  for  choices  that  are  consistent  with  their  willingness  or 
availability, and to avoid to overstate their possibility:  
Doing activism generates frustration. Because that is really a lot that you have to take care of. 
[...] Being an activist at Lucha means working at the service with women, it means cleaning the 
space, it means taking turns at initiatives, it means writing documents, writing articles, doing 
interviews, going around. [...] A lot of things are so big that there are many emotions that you 
can get through. One can be tiredness. One frustration. And I feel anger. (IIR4, LYS, 53) 
 
Political participation generates many feelings, which in a FS can be almost overwhelming. The 
emotional  load,  when  overwhelming,  becomes  negative  and  lowers  the  desire  to  participate.  In 
addition, the crisis situation makes the emotional burden greater and more complex. The ongoing 

212 
 
situation of crisis and threat of eviction worsens the feeling, as much as activists get sick or mentally 
destroyed. During the fieldwork at LYS, participants often reported the physical consequences of the 
crisis.  The  work  on  emotions  always  involves mind  and  body,  and  neither  is  ever  split,  as  an 
interviewee from LYS explains: “Rita is doing chemotherapy, the radio and then at night she runs at 
work, Claudia and Alessia are sick again, and generally all of us are having a hard time recovering. 
We are losing hopes, energies and strengths” (Fieldnotes, LYS, 12-07-19). Activism has a bodily 
dimension, and emotions deeply impact that. Political action depends not only on ideology, frames 
and values, but also on the material possibility of bodies and minds. As a LYS interviewee develops: 
Stress related to this place, [...] has created strong discomfort in our group. [...] This is real life. 
[...] How does bios get into politics? Like this. [...] And at least we give ourselves in the best 
possible way, with the greatest possible awareness that what you are looking for in your life is to 
pursue political goals but also somehow to feel good. (IIR7, LYS, 35) 
 
Activists that manage a women’s shelter encounter a stronger feeling of tiredness, because of the 
burden of responsibility. Dealing with women escaping violence means investing time, energies, and 
skills, and it is hard to manage expectations and hopes when they are disregarded. Often women go 
back to their violent partners, or operators get too close to women, or some cases hit them too hard. 
Sometimes, people drop out because they are unable to sustain the weight of this task, or they get 
overwhelmed. Who remains, explains the sense of responsibility that sometimes goes beyond the 
individual desire to rest or to quit. The sense of responsibility binds the operators to women, and 
makes them care even beyond their energies. These feelings may infect the internal relationships 
among activists.  
Political activities may also lead to pain. This feeling comes from the loss of comrades dropping out, 
the  disillusion,  or  the  change  into  political  space  trajectory.  However,  FSs  are  places  of 
transformation of pain, where activists learn to deal with personal sufferings. Sharing sufferings helps 
to find new ways to face them. As an interviewee of LYS explains, learning to work on emotions 
allows people to deal with their own path, to elaborate social conditions of inequality, and to discover 
new tools to engage with a good life: “it is no coincidence that I faced super personal biographical 
events at a time when I found a space of women who welcomed me, who made a family. It was like 
a way of saying: I enter Lucha so I can get my wings. And I am not afraid of using them” (IIR5, LYS, 
33).   
In this section, I outlined the mechanism through which FSs take affects into account as a political 
matter oriented to change. By tackling some affects (anger, love, pain, disillusion), I tried to focus on 
the process on consciousness rising and its impact on individuals. Some affects, more than others, 
produce consequences. The erotic is one of them, as I will develop in the following section.

8.3.2 The Erotic: Politics and Sexuality   
 
I started to look at women in a new way. (IIR2, LYS, 37) 
 
In the previous section, I went through the analysis of affects as positive and negative items depending 
on the way they increase or decrease the bodily capacity for action. Among the positive affects, 
participants recurrently refer to the erotic.  
The erotic dimension of activism emerged from most of the fieldwork. Some spaces consider a more 
explicit sexuality as a core issue of their political action and ideology. Depending on age, historical 
background, and political values, the politicisation of sexuality is sometimes avoided in order to 
prevent conflict, as in the case of the CID; less intense when other priorities are more prominent, as 
in the case of LYS and their direct social action; or significantly more intense, as in the case of CS. 
In this section, I will focus on similarities among the three spaces with regard to sexuality. First, I 
will look at the erotic as a networking process within FSs. Second, at the political work on sexuality. 
Finally, at the way sexuality affects individuals and communities.  
Feminist relationships can be generically imbued with a widespread eroticism, or they can be actual 
sexual relations, or love affairs. The erotic works as a networking among individuals. Participants 
consider  the  erotic  as  an  affect  consistent  with  the  practice  of  the  personal  as  political,  as  an 
interviewee of the CS explains: “everything about sexuality, eroticism between women was a topic. 
[...]  And  also  to  experiment  how  then  within the  feminist  spaces  relationships  are  created, 
relationships are nurtured, sexualised or not. And how these two things feed each other. That is, as 
personal and political” (IIIR7, CS, 30).  
The erotic is expressed in a series of actions, rituals, repetitions: a great physical proximity, activists 
who touch each other a lot during assemblies, the importance of non-verbal language in the political 
context. The bodily dimension of feminist activism opens new possibility for thinking about one’s 
own sexuality. An interviewee of LYS outlines that attending the physical space and the feminist 
community allowed her to think about women in a different way: “in this context for the first time I 
thought I could try other things too” (IIR2, LYS, 37). Through participation in FSs they learn “to see” 
women, both as human beings and as subjects of desire. The mobilisation process at the individual 
level is bound up with a sexuality that “affects” and “is affected by” participants. Participants change 
their relation with the body and with others at the same pace with political participation:  
I approached feminism at the same time I was questioning my sexual orientation. For me these 
two things went absolutely hand in hand. The encounter with other women was a 360 degree 
encounter. [...] It was an encounter of discovery of sisterhood, of solidarity, of my body, of my 
sexuality. [...] I'm not interested in discussing and practicing a theoretical feminism. I want a 
place that also questions the bodies, sexuality, and feminism also understood as love relationships 
between women, relationships of exchange, of experimentation. (IIIR10, CS, 30) 

214 
 
 
Despite  a  generic  recognition  of  the  erotic  as  an  element  of  feminist  politics,  when  the  lesbian 
component is the majority, a politics of sexuality becomes predominant. Sexuality changes internal 
dynamics and also the circulation of power within the assembly, as an interviewee of the CS explains: 
“It was the first space in which the heterosexual comrades were the minority, and this is something 
that shifts balances” (IIIR10, CS, 30). The lesbian connotation pertains the physical arrangement of 
the space, because “the walls speak” through banners, images, colors, symbols, and then “bodies 
speak,” too. Frequently, heterosexual men encounter feelings of discomfort in the space, because of 
the subversion of traditional gender and sexual norms.  
The second element of analysis of this section is the political work on sexuality. Sexuality does not 
pertain to the private, but it shapes the social and political world (Rubin 2007). As much as discourses 
of sexuality define appropriate behaviours, life-trajectories, and individual choices, they become part 
of the FSs’ reflection. As an interviewee of the CS reports, “if we start from the assumption that 
discourses on sexuality are those that in society form roles, form genders, form dynamics, form 
power, form everything, [...] you start by enacting them in your life and then you enact them in the 
space you occupy” (IIIR2, CS, 37). FSs deal with, name, and reflect on sexuality, by unveiling those 
dynamics involved in erotic bonds. By doing so, participants question the dark side of relationships, 
and that means violence, too. Violence occurs also within lesbian and non-heterosexual relations. “I 
think the good thing was to understand, even taking a punch in the face, [...] that if you are born in 
this culture in some way that seed has also been planted inside you” (IIIR3, CS, 30). 
The political work on sexuality impacts on individuals and communities. It changes life-trajectories 
in terms of family, coupledom, reproduction, and so on. Desire for other women is often not new to 
participants, but they find a way to express it in a context that subverts the traditional canons of the 
gender regime (Conell 1985) and heterosexuality as a norm (Wittig 2019). The subversion of gender 
and sexual norms changes the participants’ life, their frames and ways of understanding reality, as 
much as the new paradigm seems to be a non-heterosexual world. As a CS interviewee paradoxically 
notes, “now for me it's obvious that all the women I meet are not straight. I'm not saying they're 
lesbians, but they're not straight. But I realise [...] that I'm living in a slightly false reality” (IIIR4, 
CS, 30). This contiguity of desires and feelings has bodily consequences, for example with regard to 
menstruation, as an interviewee of the CS recounts: “we all had our period together. Mine had finished 
just before occupying, and then came back to me after two weeks” (IIIR4, CS, 30).  
Often, the reflection on sexuality and gender norms produces in the participants a rejection of “mixed 
spaces,” and of the dynamics these spaces enact. The rupture of the tie of dependence and desire from 
men allows for a re-consideration of political priorities. Mixed spaces are compared to families, and 

215 
 
so  the  rupture  of  the  link  with  family  of  blood  leads  to  questioning  the  link  with  other  social 
movements,  as  well.  The  choice  of  abandoning  mixed  spaces also depends  on  sexuality.  An 
interviewee of the CS explains the urge for a FS as consistent with the personal life, that always 
becomes a matter of political thinking in feminist groups:   
it's no coincidence that some 85% of the comrades who occupied the Cagne were not straight 
comrades. Let's say that a certain series of contradictions come more easily to the eye and are less 
easily tolerated when even that part of your personal life is not mixed with politics. So if you’re 
not straight it's easier to look for a place for people like you, who think like you and don't want 
to be subject to any hierarchy that always sees males at the top. (IIIR2, CS, 37) 
 
However, some of the activists consider lesbianism as a divisive issue, especially in those spaces 
coming from 1970s feminism. There, old conflicts influence present time, since the relation between 
lesbian and heterosexual feminists has been highly contentious (Biagini 2018), as I understood from 
a conversation at the CID: “Talking with Sandra, she says: ‘let alone lesbianism, which has always 
been  a  cause  of  contention...’ I  ask  her  why  and  she  tells  me  that  when  they  talked  about  the 
protagonism of feminist women and lesbians in the CID, there was always someone who stood up 
and said ‘but this divides women...’” (Fieldnotes, CID, 23-11-18). 
The complexity of feminist bonds has an impact on the community, too. The erotic influences internal 
dynamics and participants risk reproducing what they initially rejected. For instance, as an interviwee 
of the CS claims, by being agreeable to a person in the assembly only by virtue of sexual attraction 
or relationship: “recently there was a period where sometimes I flirted with Ines. I liked her so much, 
I watched her, I was always next to her in the assembly, I couldn't wait to go out with her. And then 
she said some bullshit, but like hell I told her she was talking bullshit. You know what I'm saying?” 
(IIIR5, CS, 30). However, differently than other grassroots organisations, where biopolitical ties exist 
albeit more silently, FSs claim for politicising them, especially in those spaces that engage with them 
more openly, such as the CS: 
There have been a lot of relationships between us, [...] and this obviously has an impact on the 
community, even a difficult one to manage. The difference, in my opinion, is that at least in the 
intentions [...] the goal was not to make this stuff invisible, not to relegate it to the private, but to 
try to make an effort to deal with the enormous potential of relationships between women, of 
relationships between comrades, of relationships within a community. [...] And obviously this has 
been a very strong emotional work. (IIIR10, CS, 10) 
 
As the quote shows, participants aim to break the walls between the private and the public, and it 
requires a strong emotional work. If sexuality is political, the emotions connected to sexuality, which 
are normally relegated to the private sphere, also become the object of collective elaboration. The 
effort changes the boundaries of politics on the one hand, and the use of emotions on the other.   
Yet, the work of deconstruction of norms and roles encounters the risk of a new normativity. FSs 
focus on the production of relations free from the ideal of romantic love – which is considered as 

216 
 
oppressive and sometimes a bearer of violence – and at the same time on the production of a counter-
system of care and intimacy. This “painful path” (IIIR10, CS, 10) pushes activists to go beyond what 
they  consider  negative  emotions,  such  as  ownership,  jealousy,  monogamy.  The  work  on  these 
negative emotions produces expectations on the participants’ own relationships, even in the private 
life, to be consistent with their political claims on sexuality. The “new queer normativity” comes 
from  the  fear  of  other  comrades’  judgment.  The  level  of  attention  toward  relational  dynamics 
sometimes seems to generate a climate of control and suspicion, where each person’s relations are 
put under scrutiny. Beyond the internal management of such work, the weight is exacerbated by 
external expectations that consider FSs as experts on violence and LGBTQ issues.  
By going through the erotic attachment, I analysed the erotic as networking in FSs, the political work 
on sexuality, and its impact on individuals and communities. Controversially, the erotic can be both 
a positive and a negative affect: the conscious work on erotic attachment increases the individual 
capacity for action and for a good life, but when it goes unsaid it can be detrimental to individuals 
and community.  
 
8.3.3 Affective Ties and Community Building Process 
 
Lucha Y Siesta, afternoon, summer 2019. I am sitting in the garden with Carla. Azzurra and Leyla enter from 
the gate. They are in a good mood and laugh. When Leyla sees Carla she shouts: “it’s Carla there!” and starts 
singing and beating the hand on the mouth. Carla laughs and tells me that she and Leyla have always had a 
special relation [...]. They immediately liked each other [...]. Carla tells me that she helped Leyla learn Italian 
and with a lot of other things. Leyla used to be an activist in [her native country]. For a long time, Leyla wrote 
articles on [her native country]’s newspapers and Carla helped her, to deal with Italian, English and Arabic 
language, to translate tough concepts. She tells me that Leyla is a wonderful person, with friends everywhere. 
[...] Leyla calls her son and Carla tells him to go and kiss her. When they arrived [at LYS] the child was very 
little and they attended assemblies with a walkie-talkie in order to hear if they woke up in the other room. 
(Fieldnotes LYS, Rome, 12-07-19) 
 
This chapter looks at how affects are transformed into action at an individual level. Affects influence 
the body and they signal the ability of the body (as mind, object, space) to affect another body. In this 
sense, to speak of affects is to speak of an interaction – between two bodies, between body and object, 
between  body  and  space.  Through  interactions  between  participants,  affects  move,  change,  are 
processed and transformed. On the one hand, the conscious use of affects generates affective ties
20
 
between participants; on the other hand, this generates community-building processes. First, I will 
look at how affects are made into ties among participants. Relations are something that participants 
do together. Affective ties in FSs as site of individual change. “Sisterhood” among participants is not 
 
20
 I will use the words ties, bonds and relationships as synonyms to point at feminist interaction. 

217 
 
universal (Lorde 1984, hooks 1991, Mohanty 2020) but it always signals axes of power that cut across 
the FSs’ compositions. 
 
Affect into Interactions 
Affects move through the interactions between the participants. These interactions, repeated in daily 
life, produce affective ties. As an interviewee of CS argues, whoever is part of the space has “this 
tool at her disposition” (IIIR6, CS, 35). It is a tool in the sense of something practical that is built into 
the  interaction,  and  in  the  sense  of  prefigurative  politics.  Ties  are  composed  of  everyday-life 
practices: to care for someone, to ask someone how she feels and how she is doing, to cook together, 
to clean the space, to plan activities, to take the time to rest and to have fun together. These micro-
practices of affective politics are also related to material life. Sharing economic resources is part of 
the relational task. A woman hosted at LYS explains with regard to economic sharing: “if I have a 
piece of bread and someone that arrived [at LYS] is hungry, I share it. I give it whole-heartedly, even 
though I have no money” (IIR9, LYS, 66). This orientation emerges also over health issues and 
sickness. Affective ties give participants strength, care, and solidarity that materially enhance their 
survival. Feminist ties allow women to change their own life and beliefs, by, at the same pace, aiming 
to change the world. Feminist ties are built upon love, the erotic, desire, trust, curiosity, sadness. 
Affects that produce different kinds of ties, but which through political elaboration do not become 
points of rupture, but rather elements that increase the potential for collective action, as one CS 
participant explains in this quote: “we are friends, we are sisters, we are comrades, we are lovers [...]. 
There is the awareness that all this is not hidden in the assembly, because you give it to the space, 
and it takes the space. [...] We search for collective tools so that [ties] become a potency and not an 
element  of  rupture”  (IIIR6,  CS,  35).  The  work  on  affects  is  a  relational  effort,  something  that 
participants  do  together  in  FSs.  While  the  economic  and  social  system  tends  to  produce 
individualistic, rational, self-interested, autonomous subjects, the potential and need to consciously 
work on emotions, to recognise interdependence, to develop forms of care that improve people's lives 
on a collective and not individual level is brought forward in the FSs.  Rather than depowering 
individuals, this work on the emotional sphere, long removed, allows participants to access forms of 
power (over themselves and their surroundings), as one CS interviewee argues: “it was the feeling to 
put  power  into  circulation  more  than  taking advantage  of  power”  (IIIR7,  CS,  30).  Collective 
processing practices on affects produce ties in opposition to neoliberal relational models. In this sense, 
they  are  expressions  of  prefigurative  politics,  transforming  the  lives  of  participants,  as  one  CS 
interviewee explains: 

218 
 
It is a complicity among women. [...] It is a gender issue. They teach us that we have to be jealous 
of each other. That there is something we can do and something we cannot. Feminist practices 
subvert  these  types  of  gender  constraints.  [...]  Feminist  practices  are  made  of  listening, 
welcoming diversity,  awareness,  mutual  help,  and  sisterhood.  [...]  It  is  changing.  [...]  And 
finding liveable ways to live. Where we can have less fear. (IIIR3, CS, 30) 
 
Participants use the word “sisterhood” to define affective ties among feminists, by subverting the 
blood-tie reference of the word. Sisterhood is defined as “power” coming from collective strength, 
and  the  capacity  to  act  upon  the  surrounding  world  “as  opposed  to  individual  frustration  and 
incapacity”  (IIIR,  CS,  35),  as a  CS  interviewee  argues.  Yet,  sisterhood  has  been  historically 
questioned by Black feminists. More than a universalistic formula, it is a contextual effort to keep 
differences together toward a common goal (hooks 1991). Lines of ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, 
ability,  social  status,  religion,  and  culture  cut-across  the  relational  setting.  Most  of  the  FSs  are 
composed of women, or people identified as feminist (trans people, non-binary people). Most of them 
are white and well-educated women. Some of them define it as a privilege, and acknowledge that the 
absence of racialised women is also due to the times of politics, which are often incompatible with 
racialised women’s life. On the contrary, spaces that are also hosting women escaping violence are 
less homogenous, with a migrant component. Emotions are a social product: they depend on context, 
biographical background, and socio-cultural conditions. For this reason, the work on affects in FSs 
depends on composition. Not everyone experiences the same emotions, and not everyone learns the 
same tools to use them. In the following episode retrieved from my fieldnotes, I report an interaction 
I had with a deaf-mute woman at the CID. In this interaction I realised how the practice of working 
on affects (the discomfort of a disability for those who live it and for those who interact with them, 
the inability to listen to each other, the embarrassment, the anger of those who live the disability) is 
able to transform negative affects into positive affects in the encounter between differences, and in 
this sense to increase the capacity for action even at an individual level. “I am at the cafeteria asking 
for a coffee. I try to order but the waitress makes a sign and opens her mouth without speaking. I get 
that she’s not able to speak and listen. She points out a banner with a lot of pictures of the waitress 
showing with the sign language everything you can order (such as coffee, orange juice and so on), so 
everyone can order using the sign language when she is working. Finally, I manage to order. I have 
the impression that she understood even before I used sign language, but she wanted me to notice her 
disability and so pushed me to find another way to communicate, by respecting her disability. It 
strikes me, because we are always used to taking for granted that the person we talk to has our same 
abilities. I drink the cappuccino smiling at her. She smiles too. It seems she knows that I understood 
that  this  was  a  lesson  for  me,  that to interact  we  have  to  establish  mutual  rules  of  interaction” 
(Fieldnotes CID, Rome, 25-10-18).  

219 
 
 
Community-Building Process by Means of Affects 
Affective ties are embedded in the creation of a collective identity and the sense of community. 
Collective identity works through three processes: “the creation of boundaries that mark off a group; 
the  development  of  a  consciousness  of  the  group's  distinct  and  shared  disadvantages;  and  the 
politicization of everyday life, embodied in actions that connect the members of the group and link 
experiences to larger social injustices” (Taylor and Whittier 1999: 367). These three dimensions miss 
the work of affects. According to the argument of this research, I will explore the relational use of 
affects in the politicisation of everyday life. Individuals develop an awareness about themselves and 
the social world by building a shared view of gender inequality and hints to address it. Community-
building processes take place in space and time: with regard to feminist spaces, this process has a 
strong material dimension which I will further explore. 
CS’s activists slept for a long time at the space, in order to defend it from potential threats – such as 
an eviction or neighbours’ attacks – in the first period of the occupation. While people slept, there 
were two people picketing outside the space. Every two hours (during the day and at night) people of 
the picket changed, and the former two were in charge to wake up the next two persons. At night, 
they  wanted  to  do  a  gentle  wake  up,  by  preparing  a  coffee  for  the  people  to  come.  In  order  to 
remember the way in which all the people used to drink coffee, there was a banner with the list of 
individual preferences like: “Laura: a teaspoon of sugar; Serena: two teaspoons, milk; Paola: some 
water;” and so on. This gimmick became a ritual of community building, by bridging collective action 
to intimacy, affects, and care.  
Affective ties and the sense of community are built upon the politicisation of everyday life. According 
to participants, building trust, intimacy, common frames, and ties depends on micro-practices and 
routines, and on what people do together. With regard to the space of CS, the first period of intense 
sharing, sleeping at the space, and doing pickets marked the starting point of community-building. In 
those moments, they learned to know each other, both because of assemblies and of private life, the 
way to drink coffee, the colour of the slippers and the type of toothbrush. The extreme incitement of 
that phase was a positive affect that increased the capacity for collective action at the individual level, 
as an interviewee of CS explains: “you really feel that everything is possible. [...] Because finally 
you breathe the air that you desired” (IIIR10, CS, 30).  
By developing collective and individual consciousness, feminist communities strengthen common 
frames through which they analyse, understand, and aim to change social reality. The sharing of 
common words to describe conditions of inequality generates communities. By sharing the same 

220 
 
understanding of gender norms, FSs subvert the code of a "men-made world" (Kern 2019), as this 
exchange with a CS interviewee shows:   
- How much the absence of cis heterosexual men politically counted? 
- What was the question? How much? All! [she laughs] (IIIR7, CS, 30) 
 
The  production  of  strong  community  ties  is related  to  common  frames  and  affective  resonance. 
Community-building is based on a deep mutual knowledge, knowledge of the affective mechanisms 
that drive the individual participants and the interactions between the participants, as one of the CS 
interviewees explains: “you don’t know other people’s story and private life [...] but you know how 
exactly that person works, which mechanisms she enacts, what she is doing... but maybe you don’t 
know her sister’s name” (IIR8, LYS, 30). Relational bonds are generated by knowing perfectly the 
affective mechanisms of the other participants. Collective action is thus deeply intertwined with the 
expression of individual affections, their reworking and the relational use of emotions. 
The production of the community goes along with the production of the physical space. These two 
elements are deeply linked. First, because it is the site where relations take place and people have the 
occasion to meet and know each other. The physical space is also a source of identification. The four 
walls are not just walls: “they are also symbolic. They bind us together, they make us know each 
other, love each other, root ourselves in a place” (Focus Group IIIRA transcription, Rome, 18-12-
19). Yet, the physical space might also scatter the political community, as in the case of the CID. 
Since the building is so large and over time has been inhabited by associations, the common bind has 
progressively blended.  
The size of the community depends on circles: the smaller one is related to more engaged participants, 
but then there are wider networks of friends, comrades, and supporters that at various levels interact 
with the space. The level of expression and sharing of affection determines more or less close ties, 
and thus a community of varying intensities. 
Finally, boundaries are lines of inclusion/exclusion which define communities, and affects can further 
foster  boundaries.  Strong  internal  ties  make  it  difficult  for  people  to  find  their  collocation.  The 
community is based upon a relational work on affects, and people can find it repulsive or hard to 
discern such a strong invisible structure, as a CS interviewee argue: “there are a lot of automatisms 
in the way people relate to each other that you have to understand, a lot of balances among people 
you have to get” (III8R, CS, 33). Strong ties have a positive and a negative side. On one hand, they 
allow to create a community of people that deeply know their affective mechanisms, that feel good, 
that know they can share ways of doing things. On the other hand, they make it harder to open the 
space to the outside world.  

221 
 
Boundaries are also internal to the community. Feminist communities engage in a never-ending task 
of  unveiling,  discussing,  and  re-elaborating  roles,  hierarchies,  and  internal  dynamics. As  a  CS 
participant claims,  “this is something I really like, being allowed to acknowledge power’s roles, that 
one’s word counts more than another, or that there are implicit roles and we need to pay attention. 
It’s a meta-discussion on the collective condition that we always keep having” (IIIR2, CS, 37). This 
practice of naming also regards affective ties. By working on collective and individual emotions, 
participants try to disentangle those dynamics that negatively affect the potential for collective action. 
Boundaries cannot be completely deleted, and often participants deal with them through a process of 
going back and forth. One participant describes the process as a love relationship, by shedding light 
on  the  affective  structure  which  gives  meanings,  orientation,  and  shape  to  FSs  and  individual 
participation:   
Actually I dropped out for a while. [...] Then I came back. It is like in relationships. Either you 
take care of the collective, and so also of yourself, or it doesn’t work. And sometimes you need a 
pause. [...] And it is exactly as in relationships. [...] All of us had periods in which we dropped 
out. [...] We are really honest, saying: “I can’t make it now, maybe later I will be able to.” And 
no one says “why are you dropping out?!” or “what the fuck are you doing?” [...] And so you 
feel free to stay as you can. (IIIR4, CS, 30) 
 
The perception of being there as one can, with one's affect, one's emotions, and also one's inability to 
continue to be in a collective dynamic represents the outcome, on an individual level, of the work on 
affects in FSs. Rather than nourishing loneliness, inadequacy, and the society of performance, FSs 
try to build ties and community through the awareness that the body, as well as the mind, constantly 
expresses emotions whose use can transform the capacity for collective action.  
 
8.3.4 Bonds, Negative Affects, and Internal Conflict  
 
The collective is my point of reference in every aspect and moment of my life. [...] We are friends, sisters, 
lovers, we share everything. So this is a totalising element of your life, which is beautiful but also frightening. 
Because you do not just put into play the collective, but also the whole of yourself and of your life. And you 
risk losing everything. (IIIR6, CS, 35) 
 
In the previous section, I started to outline the process of consciousness rising and the use of positive 
and negative affects at the individual level. FSs, like free spaces, allow collective actors to endure 
over time. The long duration of communities brings out a series of collective affects, which arise from 
daily politics, the intensity of interactions, and the sedimentation of common experiences. Some 
affects  that  arise  are  annoyance,  grief,  disillusionment,  frustration.  These  negative  affects  can 
undermine the participants' ability to act, and can weaken the community, when the cause of these 
emotions is not adequately investigated or taken care of collectively. The cause or consequence of 

222 
 
these negative affects is a certain level of conflict between participants. Conflict may be more or less 
manifest, and more or less negative. When it exists but is the subject of collective reflection, it plays 
a positive role. When it is unspoken, it undermines the stability and effectiveness of FSs.  
In this section, I will address two approaches to conflict and its consequences. On one hand, a high 
level of internal conflict which goes unspoken. On the other, a high level of conflict but collective 
work on contentious dynamics. In the analysis, I will take into consideration conflicts that originate 
from political reasons (ideas, visions, strategic choices) and from relational reasons. FSs are grounded 
in the work on affects, and this can be a slippery slope to manage. However, it is telling of an 
innovative way to address conflict by means of affects.   
First, I will address the conflict that goes unspoken. With regard to the CID, an interviewee explains 
that “this is a highly conflictual place. But I would say more generally, relations among women are 
highly conflictual. [...] We didn’t solve the issue of conflict among women and the disruptiveness of 
this conflict. [...] I would say that all the collectives in the 1970s ended because of this” (IR7, CID, 
69). Throughout the fieldwork at the CID, I witnessed conflicts that ran through the space-bound 
community: in the corridors, in the rooms, in the assemblies. Quite frequently I stepped into women 
harshly  debating,  as  much  as  they  were  used  to  talking  behind  one  another’s  back.  The  high 
fragmentation of the community, the hierarchical organisation of internal bodies, the long-standing 
activism of a large part of women, the situation of crisis were all triggering factors of a constant 
climate of suspicion, mistrust, tension, and discord. Even though I was a newcomer, they always took 
the opportunity to share their discontents with me. However, they were also suspicious toward me. 
In my fieldnotes, I noted down a self-reflection in relation to a (quite serious) joke that was made to 
me by one of the participants of the CID: “one of them says ‘eventually you will blackmail us, with 
all the things you see and hear.’ The more time passes, the more the women start understanding my 
presence here and start to be afraid. The internal situation is tough and conflictual and I feel that there 
are a lot of things submerged that they would prefer remain a secret, and they don’t like that I might 
get it. I feel a lot of invisible and un-public shadows, a mechanism moving the CID as an invisible 
plot”  (Fieldnotes,  CID,  09-11-18).  Conflict  can  arise  for  political  reasons:  clashes  over  visions, 
organisation, ideology. Frequently conflicts come from afar, as in the case of the 1970s division 
between the feminism of difference – coming from Milan’s feminists – and the self-consciousness 
rising groups (Stelliferi 2015). These tensions also made it challenging to define a common history 
of the CID, that always elicits “a war,” as a CID participant argues: “believe me, on this issue there 
is a war. On the slightest hint of history you find a war” (IR1, CID, 58). Conflicts arise also on the 
repertoire of action and strategic choices. For instance, the CID fragmentation concerns the choice 
between a more institutional reply to the threat of eviction and a more radical one.  

223 
 
How do FSs deal with negative affects that produce conflict? Do they reflect and use the awareness 
of these emotions to bring about a change? In the cases mentioned above, conflicts are more in the 
background than at the forefront of FSs’ work. They often go unsaid with regard to the collective 
discussion. The unspoken conflict produces a decrease of the capacity for collective action. Yet, in a 
rather paradoxical way, conflicts also work as a cement of relationships. This every-day internal 
conflict feeds the day-by-day politics of FSs even in the absence of mobilisations. 
The second way FSs relate with internal conflict is by elaborating on dynamics. The work on affects 
usually increases the capacity for collective action. However, the work on “the dark side” of affective 
bonds, which means on the negative affects that spawn from political participation, is much harder. 
This work puts the participants in front of limits, boundaries, and the unintended consequences of 
politics. As one CS interviewee explains, the awareness of reproducing dynamics of fragmentation, 
disillusionment, and suspicion is painful, but the responsibility to deal with it makes a difference: 
We faced the incapacity, despite all the speeches we made, that you end up doing the same things 
as any other collectives when you quarrel. And so you stop speaking to each other, there are 
subgroups, rumours, stuff not addressed in the assembly. We faced all the more boorish dynamics 
of politics, too. (IIIR6, CS, 35) 
 
Negative feelings such as trauma or grief are difficult to name, despite the efforts of participants. 
Tensions may lead people to drop out. Often, this end of the political path occurs without an explicit 
statement by who is dropping out, leaving the other activists with the feeling of being abandoned or 
inadequate. In the case of CS, “trauma” recurs as a word which refers to individual feelings with 
regard to omissions in community discourses. These omissions influence new people arriving at the 
space, who perceive grey areas but do not have tools to understand them. “Grief,” similarly, signals 
the loss of pieces of the group, and the incapacity to go ahead with new projects and energies.  
Affective bonds expose to high levels of eventual pain and annihilation. These bonds require the 
involvement of the life of the participants, their emotions, thoughts, and beliefs. When conflict arises 
in this type of relationship, it does not only touch political-strategic issues, but also the deepest chords 
of the self. As one CS interviewee explains, feminist politics is not only about public protests, but it 
also involves the intimacy, the biographical paths, and the development of the emotional sphere of 
the  participants,  and  in  this  sense  conflicts  do  not  only  affect  the  public,  but  also  the  personal 
dimension: 
This is a specificity of feminist and transfeminist politics. [...] We are not talking about organising 
a march for getting rid of university taxes and I think we need the banner and you think we need 
the sound. It is another level, because when you are doing feminist politics your entire life is on 
the table. Your identity, your way of living relationships, sexuality, the body, desire... so when 
someone is in conflict with you, there are these whole things put into questions... not only the 
political ideology. (IIIR6, CS, 35) 
 

224 
 
As Rupp and Taylor argue about the US women’s movement, “the intensity of emotion expressed 
during the internal conflicts is understandable in light of the centrality of friendship and intimate 
relationships in the group’s everyday life. [...] While friendship could help to limit conflict, it could 
also aggravate it. The bitterness of the lawsuit was itself in part a result of the intermingling of 
personal and political ties for many of the members” (1989: 42).  
In order to negotiate the intensity of affective bonds, FSs need to make an “informal deal” that 
participants have to respect. In some cases the deal is informal, in others, such as with LYS, the deal 
is  a  formal  contract.  Since  these  rules  are  shared  and  negotiated,  their  transgression  is  a  severe 
mortgage on the collective balance. This deal helps to mediate conflicts through a practical tool, as 
one of the LYS participants explains: “we have to preserve ourselves as an entity, a group, a house’s 
community. And so, on some stuff there is no compromise. It is tough because relations of trust are 
built... so it is not always easy to give priority to the rule rather than the relationship. But if you break 
the rule in a bad way my respect for you drops” (IIR6, LYS, 35).  
When conflicts do not go unspoken, FSs elaborate several strategies to deal with them. Through the 
act of naming (Melucci 1996), participants try to put words to unspoken dynamics. Conflicts may get 
stuck because of people’s refusal to talk. This silence transforms issues into taboos, that are much 
more  difficult  to  address.  A  participant  from  LYS  explains  that  the  common  purpose  drives  the 
naming of negative emotions so that they do not compromise the political goal: “we are not just a 
group of friends, we have a goal. On that goal we built up care, our relations, and so on. So that is 
part of the goal” (IIR3, LYS, 43). Naming conflicts is the way to face them. As one LYS participant 
explains, processing conflicts collectively is the only way to avoid the distorted consequences of 
groups, which naturally incur more or less open forms of conflict: “conflict is healthy, while the group 
is sick. [...] Conflict is healthy because it should let issues and troubles emerge. But then there is 
another step: sharing and saying things. [...] When you collectively talk about things, even if they 
are addressing one person, they are faced collectively” (IIR4, LYS, 53). 
In this section, I have analysed how negative affects trigger or emerge from conflicts within FSs, and 
how they are handled or not. Conflicts may concern political, organisational, strategic issues, or 
relational dynamics. In some cases, the conflict goes predominantly unspoken. In part, this diminishes 
the capacity of FSs to act, depriving them of their transformative capacity. On the other hand, it also 
has the consequence of calcifying conflicts in the everyday life of the space, contributing in some 
way  to  its  survival  in  the  latent  periods  of  mobilisations.  In  other  cases,  FSs  try  to  elaborate  a 
collective  reflection  on  negative  emotions.  The  depth  and  complexity  of  the  ties  makes  this 
elaboration difficult, which takes the form of trauma or mourning. However, the practice of naming 

225 
 
and dealing with negative emotions that trigger or emerge from conflicts helps FSs to increase their 
capacity for collective action. 
 
 
8.4 Affect in the Long Run  
 
 
8.4.1 Different Paths, Similar Outcomes 
 
She tells me that everyone pays high prices for her revolutions. (Fieldnotes, CID, 19-11-18) 
 
This chapter look at the participants’ paths, from the first moments of mobilisation to the learning 
process of becoming feminist. This process occurs by mobilising affects: positive and negative affects 
become the matter of awareness, development, and transformation. In this last section, I will explore 
how affects work in the long run, and which outcomes can be traced in the biographies of participants.  
“Afternoon, the kitchen room, the CID, Rome. I have just started eating when a woman comes up to 
me. [...] She tells me that she has lived all over the place, that she lived in the Umbrian mountains 
for ten years but now she does not know anymore where she wants to live. She cannot calm down. 
She says she came back to the ‘House’ [the CID] because ‘I needed to stay in this place again, given 
the misery of the society around us. I needed to know that this place exists’” (Fieldnotes, CID, 31-
10-18).  This  episode,  retrieved  from  my  fieldnotes,  among  many  others,  connected  me  with  the 
feelings of the women that were once – or still are – engaged in feminist spaces. Most of them 
mentioned the overwhelming impact that feminist participants had on their own lives, and the role of 
FSs as a source of individual change. 
According to several research on biographical consequences of social movement participation on the 
life course, some elements recur – like the tendency to remain involved at some levels and to perform 
leftist political attitudes (Fendrich 1993, McAdam 1988, Taylor and Raeburn 1995, Whittier 1995). 
With regard to feminist spaces, the practice of “the personal as political” assumes a different meaning, 
relative to age, generation, and ideology, and the feminist space to which each one refers. In this 
section, I will look at the way biographical outcomes are bound up with affect. These groups share 
different times of joining the space; time in the movement (i.e., length of activism); and age-cohort. 
However, they show similarities in the biographical outcomes. First, I will explore the engagement 
in FSs as a watershed event. Second, I will look at changes in the field of gender and sexuality by 
means of feminism. Finally, I will go through the unravelling of life-course norms.  

226 
 
For  all  of  the  interviewees,  the  engagement  in  feminist  politics  is  a  watershed  event.  A  CID 
interviewee explains on one hand the engagement as a ford, and on the other the impact of such 
engagement, that involves the whole existential dimension: “it has become for me and for all those 
who have crossed it a ford, a passage from which there is no turning back. The existential dimension, 
I would say, is the main thing” (IR9, CID, 72). This process occurs by enhancing self-consciousness 
raising and collective identity, which has a deep influence on individuals. Both aspects are consistent 
with a progressive detachment from the male sphere, as a symbolic, cultural and political sphere, but 
also as a physical one, through the relative removal of the male element from the individual life.  
We can consider the starting point of political engagement in a FSs as an eventful moment. Scholars 
who  investigated  protests  as  eventful  moments  describe  these  events  as  “characterized  by  an 
experience of a rupture in daily life” (Zhuravlev 2015: 69), and which “challenge existing structures” 
(della Porta 2018: 3). Similarly, the affective rupture produced by the engagement in FSs unravels 
daily  life.  The  consequence  of  activism  as  a  watershed event  is  similar  for  all  the  age-cohorts. 
However, they come to that outcome through different paths.  
“I am spending the morning at the CID. At some point I meet one of the activists and we start chatting 
about her experience in the feminist movements and in the CID. She tells me that the only process 
which can change the world is the inner consciousness of women. A change in their way of being in 
the  world.  [...]  In  their  case,  as  1970s  feminists,  self-consciousness  messed  everything  up: 
relationships,  family,  relations  with  their  mother,  with  culture,  with  work,  because  if  you  start 
changing things you acknowledge that all the awareness you must have to be socially accepted is 
frightening” (Fieldnotes, CID, 19-11-18). In this conversation, a CID participant sheds light on how 
long-term activism raised her awareness on the relation between biographies and feminist politics. 
She addresses the fields of intimacy and family, the one of professional career, and of culture as the 
spheres where political engagement had an impact. For older activists this can be a negative impact, 
when the changes of one's life deeply struggle with the structures of a society that has not changed at 
the same pace (McAdam 1988, 1989, Giugni and Grasso 2016, Fillieule and Neveau 2019). Age is a 
key factor in the emotional setting and in the participants’ willingness to keep organising.  
The impact is mediated by the length of time spent in the FS: as something occurred in the past, the 
boundaries are less clear, and the somehow negative perception of the present, linked to ageing and 
social structures, is harder. 
Participants of LYS, instead, have a perception of strong impact of the engagement in the feminist 
space. To illustrate the jump to another stage of life, one interviewee describes it as “a small, personal 
Copernican revolution. This is how I catapulted myself down ‘the White Rabbit Hole’, and it became 
more and more intense” (IIR1, LYS, 37). In the novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis 

227 
 
Carroll,  the  metaphor  of  the  White  Rabbit  Hole  symbolises  Alice’s  adventure  along  the  path  to 
adulthood, through which she builds her identity, her choices, and her life course, by increasing her 
self-consciousness and personal strength (Carroll 2014). The metaphor fits with the role of FSs in the 
participants’  life  paths,  as  long  as  the  political  engagement  re-shapes  their  frames,  identity, 
behaviours, values. Participants become able to get in touch with their emotions, sufferings, and 
needs, but also to acknowledge the social inequalities they are trapped in. “In this space [LYS] I 
undertook  a  biographic  re-evaluation.  I  looked  back  at  my  past  and  enriched  it  with  a  new 
perspective” (C2, 1, 37). Biographical revaluation also concerns women, lesbians, and queer people’s 
understanding  of  gender-based  violence.  As  spaces  that  are  deeply  involved  in  the  fight  against 
gender-based  violence,  they  enhance  the  participants’  awareness  of  the  multiple  dimensions  of 
violence, and the way violence shapes their lives. The deep change in participants’ lives produces an 
emotional charge. For those activists working in direct social action (Bosi and Zamponi 2015), such 
as the management of anti-violence services, mental breakdown can be an outcome.  
Ideology, the closeness in time to the opening of the FSs, and the age of activists make the impact of 
engagement stronger.  
Similarly, for CS the engagement in feminist space represents a revolutionary shift in the activists’ 
life. As the following quote shows, each experienced an important moment: 
For me “the before” of the Cagne Sciolte is like a previous life. It was a life where, first of all, I 
was heterosexual. In which I did not live in Rome. In which I lived in monogamous relationships, 
I  did  mixed  politics.  I  had  never  wondered  about  my  person,  my  body,  my  sexuality,  the 
relationships I created. “The after” is only the Cagne... in the sense that for me the birth of the 
Cagne Sciolte is a watershed in life. [...] “The after” has been another life. (C3, 10, 30) 
 
The process of feminist political participation influences the relation with the self, leading to a deep 
questioning of one’s gender identification and sexuality. Differences occur in age-cohort paths – 
depending on early socialisation, the historical context, and discussion about sexuality and gender, 
ideology, and repercussions in the present. Previously, I explored the legitimisation of the erotic and 
love as a feeling towards other women as an outcome of feminist politics.  
Different  backgrounds  shape  different  political  perceptions  and priorities.  Depending  on  age, 
historical background, and political values, the politicisation of sexuality is sometimes avoided in 
order to prevent conflict, as in the case of CID, less intense in the case of LYS, or significantly more 
intense, as in the case of CS. 
Just as sexuality emerged as a site of biographical outcomes, gender matters, too. The women’s 
movement recognised gender as a category of analysis and a social construction (Scott 1988, Butler 
2006). Questioning social categorisations and gender roles became a priority for FSs (Piccone Stella 
and Saraceno 1996, Naldini and Saraceno 2011). Social reproduction, a typical women’s task, is 

228 
 
constantly  addressed  and  re-shaped.  Care,  as  an  un/natural  requirement  for  women,  is  being 
disentangled into inter-dependency. This challenge is formulated in different ways, depending on the 
cohort of participants.  
The older cohort related to the CID has been remarkably engaged in questioning gender socialisation, 
by fighting for self-determination, equal parenting rights between men and women, and so on. As 
such, they are an unprecedented generation. “We are still completely new elderly women in history” 
(C1, 7, 69). Because of this historical background, CID participants show the greater shift in terms of 
gender socialisation and life-course trajectories.  
With regard to LYS, the management of the anti-violence shelter leads them to develop a series of 
capacities and skills. The fight against gender-based violence requires to deeply question what a 
woman is, what a woman is in relation to a man, and what are the boundaries of this relationship. 
This work also regards boundaries: gender is a factor organising society (Scott 1986). Participants 
discuss what is taken for granted in gendered relationships, and they contest the way violence is 
embedded and naturalised.  
Both LYS and CS have developed a set of skills in order to avoid male intervention. By challenging 
gendered socialisation and the sexual division of labour, which orients women into, for instance, 
caring activities and men into technical tasks, they engage in work that involves plumbing, electricity, 
mechanics, carpentry, and so on. Participants wish to do everything on their own without involving 
men, when it is usually taken for granted that men are the ones who perform such technical tasks.  
The  CS,  influenced  by  recent  developments  and  reflections  on  gender,  has  reached  a  deeper 
questioning  of  gender  identification.  By  disentangling  the  gender  binarism  (or  the  male/female 
dichotomy), they are open to the possibility of fluid gender identification, or gender transition.  
Moreover, the changing relationship with the body and the self is favoured by the specificities of this 
particular  space,  which  was  formerly  a  nightclub.  As  a  consequence,  since  the beginning  of  the 
occupation, they started a self-managed pole dancing course, as an interviewee recounts: “the pole 
dance course [...] was something that changed my existence. That is the relationship with my body 
[...]. It was very powerful” (IIIR10, CS, 30). 
For all of the three age-cohorts, the questioning of gender norms produces a disentanglement from 
the expected life course (McAdam 1989). However, it impacts the spheres of relationships and work 
in different ways.  
At a  certain  point,  these  women  were  supposed  to  get  married,  take  care  of  their  children,  and 
eventually to find a job which would be compatible with childbearing and, more generally, with social 
reproduction (Naldini and Saraceno 2007). At the aggregate level, scholars emphasise a period effect 
due to the transition to new family patterns in the post-War era, which is related to economic growth, 

229 
 
changes in norms and values, and the shifts in gender roles (Saraceno and Naldini 2007). At the 
micro-level, women who are engaged in FSs display an ongoing influence of such activism in their 
own lives and relational settings.  
 “Maturing feminism [...] is a way of being, a thought and an ethics and it has been very painful. It 
meant separating, for some even in a traumatic, scientific way, like ‘I cannot live in these conditions, 
my daughter has to grow up in other conditions’” (IR9, CID, 72). Feminist activism has effects on 
the  life  course,  disrupting  traditional  stages  and  expectations.  CID’s  participants  show  the  most 
lasting effects, both in terms of loneliness and frustration related to unconventional choices in a world 
that has not changed at the same rate, and in terms of work, with absorption in public structures or 
impoverishment processes. For LYS’s participants, the field of relationships is more strongly joined 
by the field of work: the management of services leads to professionalisation in fields related to 
activism. For CS’s participants, the change concerns above all the sphere of relationships, oriented 
towards the family of choice and a relative rejection of procreation and marriage.  
 
8.5 Mobilising by Means of Affects: A Summary 
 
The argument of this research is 1) that within FSs a conscious, ongoing, and political work on affects 
takes place, 2) that this work increases the capacity for collective action. Affects are considered as 
processes that relate bodies, minds, objects, and spaces, as gradients of intensities and vital forces 
that, at a conscious level, become emotions (Ahmed 2004, Massumi 2015). In this empirical chapter, 
I analysed how the work on affects produce consequences on the paths of participants.  
First, I explored how people get to actively participate in FSs. To do this, I looked at individual 
mobilisation processes, feminist political socialisation, and the way people find a place in FSs by 
performing a role. This path of becoming feminist is bound up with affects. Affects emerge as a 
stimulus for political participation, but also as an intangible cloud that strengthens the relationship 
with the space and the desire to be part of it.  
Becoming feminist is an apprenticeship in emotions, the socio-economic conditions that determine 
affects, how they move between bodies, how spaces change, and what political use can be made out 
of them. The examination of the architecture of emotions issued by FSs sheds light on the mechanisms 
that  make  affects  the  engine  of  an  increase  in  collective  capacity.  Positive  affects,  according  to 
Spinoza, are those that increase the power of life, negative ones decrease it. Affects, in all their 
nuances, enhance the structure of meaning of FSs, their goals and their outcomes. Among these 
affects,  the  erotic  emerges  as  an  impalpable  dust  that  innervates  bonds  among  participants. 
Understanding this element, which breaks down the dichotomy between private and public, helps us 

230 
 
to  understand  how  collective  emotions  produce  life  power.  Affections  produce  ties  between 
participants,  and  this  affective  structure  generates  a  sense  of  community.  The  dark  side of the 
emotional dust are conflicts among participants: when they go unspoken they decrease the capacity 
for action and produce fragmentation and resentment, when they are collectively elaborated can serve 
as a boost to action.  
Finally, I looked at affect in the long run. Although from different paths, participants present similar 
outcomes with regard to feminism as a watershed event, to transformations in the field of gender and 
sexuality, to the subversion of life-course norms. Emotional learning in FSs produces concrete effects 
on participants' biographies, life choices, interests, professionalisation, life expectations. In a gender 
regime that is highly normative towards women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people, the discovery 
of the potential of affects changes life trajectories beyond the destiny predicted by socio-economic 
structures. 
The analysis at the micro level allows to understand the functioning of affects in relation to the paths 
of  individuals,  to  the  relationships  between  individuals,  and  over  the  long  term  of  their  life 
trajectories. The analysis of affect at the individual level is typical of affect theory and Spinoza's 
thought, but instead of being an individual process, in reference to the FSs it is the result of an ongoing 
collective work. Why do affects transform the potential for action on an individual level, and why is 
this potential relevant? The analysis shows the specificity of affect to break through the dichotomies 
that  underlie  Western  thought  and  also  the  birth  of  capitalism  (Hirschman  1977).  The  capitalist 
economic  model prescribes  a  certain  subjectivity:  the  rational  social  actor,  oriented  towards 
maximising profit, building his career, joining a nuclear family, but all the while maintaining his 
labour productivity. Very often, the prescription of this subjectivity results in a sense of frustration, 
of being inappropriate, incapable, a fraud or a failure. The construction of one's own productivist 
trajectory is often associated with these negative feelings, the category of rational social actor being 
very normative and very difficult to fulfil. Within the FSs, the production of an alternative model of 
subjectivity  is  experimented  with.  This  subjectivity  is  understood  to  be  constructed  from  an 
understanding of affects and emotions which, like a compass, indicate conditions of malaise and 
frustration, but also the orientation towards improving one's living conditions. Perceiving this work 
on affects and then learning to manage it allows participants to access a transformative practice of 
their self and their path. This possibility is in contradiction to the subjectivity prescribed by the 
economic model and as such produces a sense of liberation and empowerment on the one hand, and 
frustration on the other, as the hegemonic model always forces a certain degree of adjustment. It is 
important, however, to emphasise how the analysis of the work on affects shows how this sphere, 
which is often removed even by social movements, is actually capable of enhancing the sense of self, 

231 
 
the affirmative projection, the willful to act in the world. In this sense, the work on affects is an 
example of good practice that is also available to other social movements interested in transforming 
the  potential  for  individual  action.  On  the  other  hand,  this  work  on  affects  is  able  to  show  the 
normativity of the model of subjectivity imposed by the neo-liberal economic model, and to propose 
alternatives that question the hegemonic model.

9. Spain: Insights for a Comparison  
 
 
9.1 Introduction  
 
It is like a train you can't miss. (IIIM4, PEB, 54) 
 
In this chapter I propose some insights for a comparison between Italy and Spain, with respect to FSs 
in urban contexts. The exploration of the Spanish cases was highly constrained by the outbreak of the 
Sars-Cov-2 virus.  The  fieldwork  was  supposed  to  begin  in  March  2020,  when  many  European 
countries  opted  for  lockdown.  Despite  the  postponement,  I  was  able  to  pursue  five  months  of 
fieldwork in 2021. At that time, the pandemic was still ongoing and most of the FSs spectacularly 
reduced their public activities. However, some of them kept proposing online activities, and in the 
last months I was able to attend some in-person initiatives. I am here analysing data coming from the 
online/offline ethnographic period and interviews (almost five for each space, plus a key informant). 
Regardless of the constraints, the empirical analysis stimulates some hints for a comparison, and it 
aims to broaden the understanding of both cases.  
First, I will go through the herstory of the feminist movement in Spain, by drawing attention on some 
key junctures that foster the comprehension of contemporary FSs. With regard to this, I will look at 
the trajectories of the movement between State feminism and autonomous organisations, and then at 
the similarities with frames, ideology, and practices of the feminist movements in Italy. In Spain, as 
well, the work on affects can be detected at the macro, meso, and micro level. First, I will look at the 
way FSs interact at the macro level: with the arena of the economic, political, and health crisis; with 
players at the local level; with the institutional setting and feminist movements. These interactions 
are mediated by affects and they produce consequences depending on this mediation. At the micro 
and  meso  level,  I  will  elaborate  on  the  production  of  safer  spaces,  by  looking  at  the  way  they 
proliferate (depending on the context) and on the process of becoming safer through the collective 
work on/of affects. In order to do so, I will specifically refer to the practices of internal democracy 
and to the political understanding of care and vulnerability as vectors for building alliances. This 
process shapes individual paths and collective action, and similarities and differences occur with 
regard to the comparison with Italy.  
The chapter aims to show how the work of affects enhances FSs capacity to produce knowledge, lets 
people engage with politics, and produces viable outcomes. The institutional variable, in the case of 
Spain, results in a double process: on one hand, the proliferation of safer spaces and of feminist 

233 
 
prefigurative  politics;  on  the  other  hand,  the  higher  compromises  between  feminist  claims  and 
institutional constrains.  
 
9.2 Movements Trajectories between Institutionalisation and Radicalisation 
 
 
9.2.1 The Herstory of the Feminist Movements 
 
Because there is the transversality of feminism, which is to put people at the centre of life. It is to put at the 
centre what we have to take care of on this planet. (IIM3, EK, 54) 
 
The feminist movement in Spain was drastically influenced by the Francoist regime, which endured 
from 1939 to 1975, when the dictator died. Before, starting from the 15
th
 century, several authors 
with a feminist sensitivity were already active (Caballè 2013). Religious women, poets, and authors 
argued in favour of equal rights, rethinking the role of women in society. After the Civil War and the 
imposition of a dictatorship, women groups organised within the anti-Francoist groups’ resistance 
(Valiente 2013). All of them were clandestine. The largest groups were the Movimiento Democrático 
de Mujeres (which was part of the Communist Party) and the Unión Popular de Mujeres (UPM). The 
latter was created by militants of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (PCE [ml]) and it became 
part of the Frente Revolucionario Antifascista y Patriótico (FRAP). Tensions flowed among women 
groups, such as the former group accusation of terrorism toward the latter. As a key informant tells, 
the conditions of the regime shaped women’s life and politics on a strict interdependency between 
the personal and political, the private and public dimension:  
So  my  generation  grew  up  politically  without  separating  [...]  everyday  life,  [...]  the  body, 
relations between people, and relations between men and women. That is to say, sentimental 
relationships, with family, with friends, everything was at stake... everything had to be rebuilt, 
everything had to be learned, everything had to be done. We grew up like that... [...] Because it 
was all one. (KM1, UPM, 72) 
 
Unlike Italy, where women experienced the resistance to the fascist regime some twenty years earlier 
without a strong feminist perspective, in Spain resistance was also organised through a growing 
awareness of women. In memory and narrative there remains a sense of the juncture between the 
political  struggle  and  the  subjective  dimension,  which would later  be  one  of  the  eminent 
characteristics  of  the  feminist  movement.  As  the  following  quote  shows,  the  UPM  was  mostly 
composed of proletarian women and their fight for labour rights was closely linked to liberation as 
women: 
These women, I remember, used to make leaflets that [...] were really [...] down to earth, they 
were  very  simple.  [....]  It  was  really  their  life  that  was  expressed  with  a desire  to  make  a 
revolution to change everything. [...] Then feminism made a narrative about how we had to start 
from ourselves. I lived a militancy that started from that. Because that was their reality and what 

234 
 
led them to want to make the revolution and it was all one... not that we wanted democracy, for 
fuck's sake. Everything has to be changed here. (KM1, UPM, 72)  
 
These groups were actively part of the democratic transition, despite the almost complete failure to 
purge  who  was  part  of  the  regime  (Threlfall,  Cousins  and  Valiente  2005, Valiente  2008).  The 
persistence of the Francoists in the State apparatus, combined with a democratic transition without 
any culprits, has led to a sort of “un-speakability” (IIM1, EK, 30) of the dictatorship, that persists 
nowadays, too.  
Despite the absence of the feminist movement of the 1970s as it emerged in other countries, the 
Spanish feminist movement is heavily influenced by practices and reflections developed by anti-
Francoist women before and after the transition. As Caballé argues, because of these reasons Spanish 
feminism is “more pragmatic than theoretical, more disposed to concrete action than speculation” 
(2013: 17). From 1975 on, the feminist movement was split by the discussion on the relation with 
institutions or the autonomous choice, that I will deepen in the following paragraph. As a result of 
this debate, two feminists were elected in the first elected parliament of 1977-79 (Threlfall 2013), 
and the Instituto de las Mujeres was created in 1983. On the other hand, groups, collectives, and 
spaces  proliferated,  by  developing  autonomous  forms  of  reflections  on  feminist  principles  (Gill 
2011). Under the first Zapatero government, in 2008, the Ministerio de Igualdad was created together 
with a new law against gender-based violence, which completely disrupts the legislative, political, 
and social setting. Feminist movements were flourishing for decades, and they found a new vitality 
within the 15-M mobilisations in 2011 (Gamez Fuentes 2015, Portos 2019). The so-called Comisión 
de Feminismos Sol (Commission of Feminisms in Sol) brought together different claims and groups, 
by  broadening  the  claim  on  participatory  democracy  from  a  gendered  perspective  (Cruells  and 
Ezquerda 2015). Later, influenced by a new wave of mobilisation from 2015, feminist movements 
greatly mobilised around the feminist strike of the 8 March for several years.  
By now, some debates remain salient, such as the trans people movement’s claims and the sex work 
issue. However, activists consider contemporary feminist, LGBT and queer movements (which are 
strongly interconnected) just as advanced in terms on reflections on sexuality, bodies, gender, health, 
and  racialisation.  As  one  of  them  comments  with  regard  to  gender  questioning, “for  today's 
generation, the non-binary is a conquest. But for me, being fifty years old, it was like a dream, wasn't 
it?” (IIIM4, PEB, 54). 
As in Italy, feminist politics appears to be rooted in the work on the self, on emotions, on collective 
affects.  Through  this  work  of  consciousness-raising,  activists  elaborate  alternative  structures  of 
feelings that support, nourish, and strengthen collective action. The biggest difference concerns the 
areas in which this relationship between politics, conscience, and affects has developed: if in Italy 

235 
 
there has been a relative refusal of dialogue with the institutions, since the 1970s in Spain State 
feminism emerged.  
 
9.2.2 State Feminism and Autonomous Organisations  
 
It's true that here in Spain we breathe a different air... (IIIM1, PEB, 24) 
 
While walking in Calle de Alcalà, I stepped into the façade of the Ministry of Equality. Three large 
purple banners bore the words “Feministas,” “Por ser Mujeres,” and “Nos Queremos Vivas.” The last 
claim is one of the slogans of the transnational movement started by Ni Una Menos in Argentina. The 
institutional seat in charge of gender equality refers of the imaginary and symbolic codes of the 
feminist movements. I found it striking, because of the radical difference with the Italian context. 
Another world seemed to open up, for the research and for understanding the construction of FSs.  
The trajectory of the feminist movements in Spain differs completely from Italy. As mentioned above, 
from 1975 differences among the feminist movements emerge. Differences exploded during the II 
Jornadas Feministas Estatales de la Mujer in Granada. Part of the feminist movement, such as the 
Movimiento Democrático de Mujeres, came from a Marxist background and they identified the core 
of the oppression in the capitalist structure and in the sexual division of labor. In order to achieve the 
goal  of  women’s  empowerment  through  dismantling  capitalist  structures,  they  referred to  the 
feminism  of  equality  and  pushed  for  the  interplay  with  institutions  (Gil  2011).  Others,  like  the 
Colectivos Feministas,  reflected instead upon women’s sexuality and differences, and considered the 
patriarchy as the core of feminist reflection (Sendòn 2002). They rejected any kind of dialogue with 
institutions and claimed autonomy for collective action. Depending on this split, feminist groups 
engaged in different strategies. On one hand, they progressively entered political parties, they founded 
new ones such as the Partido Feminista de España, or they took part in local, regional, and national 
government (Threlfall, Cousins and Valiente 2005, Threlfall 2010). On the other hand, they organised 
in groups, collectives, feminist spaces, and social centres (Gil 2011).  
The State feminism option produces several consequences. On one hand, the entrance of feminists 
within the State apparatus resulted in a widespread acknowledgement of the women’s issue as a 
priority  in  local,  regional,  and  national  politics  (Threlfall,  Cousins  and  Valiente  2005).  This 
achievement allowed feminist claims to be addressed in policies, public debates, culture, common 
sense. In this process, the double thrust of State feminism and a massive autonomous mobilisation 
yielded a cultural shift in terms of gender balance and roles. Albeit great issues remain unsolved, such 
as LGBTQ and non-binary people’s full legal recognition, or the racialisation and lack of rights for 
non-native  people,  a  significant  change  in  habitus  and  mindset  is  unanimously  reported  by 

236 
 
interviewees.  As  an  Italian  interviewee  that  moved  to  Madrid  argues, “if  a  Spanish  Carlo  Conti 
[famous Italian presenter] made a macho joke, the next day everyone would denounce him. However 
they underline it, at least they realise that the joke was macho. In Italy it's normal” (IIIM1, PEB, 24). 
Differences exist between political parties, and they open different types of political opportunity 
structures  for  feminist  goals:  while  leftist  parties  tend  to  open  up  wider  spaces  for  equality  and 
feminist claims, right-wing parties aim at eroding them, for instance by claiming a shift in the fight 
against  male  violence  from  “male”  to  “all  types  of  violence.”  However,  interviewees  report  a 
perception of what feminists can claim that greatly differs from the Italian case. Often, regardless of 
their political affiliation in autonomous organisations, activists work in their daily life in women’s 
spaces and services managed by institutions. As an EDI interviewee explains: 
I believe that this battle is still being fought on both fronts. There must be free and autonomous 
women's associations, but there must also be an institutional feminism that protects and defends 
women's rights above any political party. And we must continue to fight this fight from within 
the institutions. [...] Without an institutional framework we have nothing more than our voice in 
the streets. This has to be answered with public budgets, with public resources, with feminist 
professionals who do not question the word of women. (IM1, EDI, 44) 
 
The  subjective  narrative  reports  the  entrenchment  of  the  belief  that  institutions  owe  feminism 
resources, spaces, services, and a transformation of values and norms. For them, feminism must be 
part  of  the  institutions  and  must  negotiate  from  within  them.  While  in  the  Spanish  cases  the 
intertwining with institutions is almost a given, in the Italian case it is still an element of rejection. 
As a paradigmatic example, the municipality of Madrid manages seventeen Espacios de Igualdad, 
one for each district (even though, as an interviewee points out, “seventeen on twenty-one districts, 
there are still four equality spaces left to be opened” (IM1, EDI, 42). As an EDI interviewee argues, 
“the Espacios de Igualdad could almost be like an updated version of the women's houses of the 
1980s” (IM1, EDI, 42). They have the aim to disseminate feminist principles, to enhance women’s 
empowerment,  and  to  offer  solutions  to  practical  problems  related  to  gender-based  violence, 
racialisation, and pauperisation. In the meanwhile, the municipality of Madrid currently pursues four 
cross-cutting programs: Madrid Zero Violence, Madrid Safe City along with Empowered Women 
and Girls, and Co-responsible Madrid. These programs enhance the balance of the care-work within 
families and partners, the creation of a city that challenges discriminations and exclusions, and the 
fight  against  gender-based  violence.  Spaces  and  municipal  programs  greatly  contribute  to  the 
diffusion  and  strengthening  of  a  gender  sensitivity  among  the  population,  and  they  practically 
intervene in situations of need with resources, services, and professionality.  
However,  as  other  interviewees  underline,  the  institutionalisation also has  a  dark  side,  since  it 
contributes to emptying and depowering the radicality of the movement, and to accepting more and 

237 
 
more compromises in terms of claims. Nonetheless, some ties among autonomous groups and State 
feminism exist, and claims and needs flows from one arena to the other.  
The entrenchment of State feminism is visible in subjective narratives, regardless of the political 
belonging of the activists. Strategies, forms of action, and political outcomes of the movement seem 
to be at the next level of effectiveness, because they do not only concern movements from below, but 
also the public management of affairs. It is no coincidence that, following the 2011 mobilisations, 
one of the consequences was the creation of movement parties that entered the institutions, bringing 
feminism to the forefront as a prominent issue.  
 
 
9.2.3 Mediterranean Feminism: Cross-National Diffusion 
 
So  far,  I  highlighted  the  differences  between  the  Spanish  and  the  Italian  context.  On  one  hand, 
Franco’s enduring regime constrained the proliferation of women’s movement until the mid-1970s, 
and also the type of claims, practices, and organisation. On the other, the debate between the feminism 
of equality and the feminism of difference produced a closer approach to institutions and a peculiar 
context for autonomous groups.  
Though, some similarities unite the feminist movement in Spain and Italy. As an EK interviewee 
argues, “Italy was our reference” (IIM3, EK, 54), and another interviewee adds: “we have learned a 
lot from the Italian tracks and we continue to learn from them. Like Silvia Federici, many feminist 
comrades have taught us a lot about collectives and articulation”  (IM2, EDI, 44). The interviews 
show how cross-national diffusion is perceived at the level of subjective narrative. If on a theoretical 
level the contamination of movement ideas (McAdam and Rucht 1993) from the Italian feminism of 
the 1970s is evident in Spain, this contamination is also recognised by activists in the everyday life 
of  political  participation.  Feminist  movements  in  Spain  borrow  ideas  and  tactics  from  historical 
feminism in Italy, and this diffusion goes through relational ties among activists and nonrelational 
channels (McAdam and Rucht 1993). Dissemination concerns the memory of the feminist movement, 
the ideological references that underpin the movement, and the repertoires of action – such as the 
concept of social reproduction, the intertwining of capitalism and patriarchy, Marxist feminism, the 
importance of physical places (such as women's homes, bookshops, health clinics, and so on). The 
scope  of  1970s  feminism  in  Italy  has  transcended  borders  and  constitutes  a  basis  for  concepts, 
perspectives  of  thought  and  struggle.  Translations  of  Italian  authors  such  as  Carla  Lonzi,  Silvia 
Federici, Maria Rosa Dalla Costa, and others have shaped the path of reflection of Spanish groups.  

238 
 
At the same time, the diffusion concerns ideas and tactics that come from Spain to Italy, such as the 
intertwining of gender, sexuality, and race, as well as precarity from the point of view of women, the 
instrument of the strike, the strategic relationship with institutions at municipal level. 
Some  more  elements  join  the  Italian  and  Spanish  contexts.  An  interviewee  calls  this  assonance 
“Mediterranean  feminism,”  by  drawing  attention  on  the  common  framework  in  which  different 
feminisms  in  the  Mediterranean  areas  develop.  The  Mediterranean  area  is  both  a  geographical 
location and a political site (Giuliani 2016). Southern Europe has always been considered through 
racialising categories which regard the division between the productive, civilised, and progressive 
North, and a backward, lazy, and unproductive South (Ghisu and Mongili 2021). For a certain period 
after  the  explosion  of  the  financial  crisis  in  2007,  international  commentators  on  the  European 
economic situation have referred to Italy and Spain with the acronym PIGS (which also includes 
Portugal and Greece) (Moro 2014). This definition, afterwards addressed as racist because of the 
derogatory meaning of the term, sums up several stereotypes. First, the laziness, backwardness, and 
cultural,  social,  and  economic  underdevelopment.  Then,  neoliberalism  and  the  imperative  of 
meritocracy,  which  Italy  and  Spain  seem  to  systematically  fail.  These  stereotypes  have  social 
consequences on individuals, who embed and reproduce common sense on themselves and on others. 
An Italian migrant argues, “when I left Italy there was also the fact that nothing works in Italy, it's 
shit.  I  go  there  [in  London]  where  everything  works.  Finally  I  can  work,  earn  money,  have  an 
independent life, public transport works. Fuck no! At a certain point I realised that that system, I 
wasn't happy with it” (IIM1, EK, 30). The representation associated with the country has an influence 
at a subjective level, and influences lifestyles, expectations on oneself, and life trajectories. 
Just  as  the  representation  of  Southern  Europe  is  a  constraint  to  individual  development,  it  also 
becomes an object of critical consciousness and cognitive liberation. Southern Europe becomes a site 
of identity, politics, and pride. This area is not only interested by racialisation processes, but is also 
characterised by the enhancement of social relationships, of the collective dimension, the political 
use of care, and interdependency as the basis of common life. The Meridian thought shapes the 
mindset and repertoire of collective action, and it develops into the subversion of the stigma of the 
South (de Sousa Santos 2014), as an EK interviewee argues:  
It doesn't mean uncritically accepting the things that don't work, the corruption, the slowness and 
all the defects of the Mediterranean that we know very well, but claiming the nature of sharing, 
of the family understood not only as a biological family but also as a social structure of care and 
sociality [...]. There is something there and that for me is also fundamental in my feminist ideal. 
It certainly has to do with sociality, sharing, care, welcoming, and a whole series of negatives that 
obviously exist. But to welcome these contradictions with a bit of pride... [...] The Mediterranean 
dimension responds to me, I feel good about it (IIM1, EK, 30) 
 

239 
 
Thus, I am here referring to Mediterranean Feminism as a geographical, political, and symbolic 
arena where certain values, concepts, repertoire of actions, cultural foundations are shared by 
different contexts and activists. The production of stigma is converted into a subjective sense 
of pride in what are considered negative passions, such as slowness or the role of ties. In 
constructing their own selves as feminists, participants elaborate a geographical and political 
framework that critically acknowledges limitations and contradictions, but also emphasises 
elements  of  political  claim. From a  feminist point  of  view,  the  role  of  ties,  care,  and 
interdependence become characteristic elements of collective action, and in this sense, both in 
relation to Italy and Spain, I speak of the construction of structures of feelings.  
In the following sections, I will look at similarities and differences between Italy and Spain 
according to this common framework, where a cross-national assonance exists.  
       
 
9.3 Comparing Feminist Spaces  
 
I think it is essential that there be a space where women can come together and share their experiences. [...] 
I believe that empowerment is not about individual discourse [...], but empowerment is about becoming aware 
of oppression. And I believe that this involves collectivising and pooling knowledge. [...] When a woman begins 
to share in a group, there is an awareness [...]. A power of wanting to transform begins to emerge, because 
when you collectivise discomfort, that is when you realise that it is not individual, you don't have a problem, 
but that it is a social problem. (IM3, EDI, 37) 
 
In the first part of the empirical analysis, I explored the production of FSs as structures of feelings in 
Italy, where affects work as 1) a channel of mediation between cognition and body, 2) a tool for 
political elaboration, and 3) a competence in action. Through constructivist grounded theory, I came 
to understand safer spaces as a process through which affects are made into politics, at the macro, 
meso, and micro level. At the macro level, I engaged with the concept of agency and structure, by 
looking at how the work on affects interplays with the strategic action of FSs with regard to economic 
models, crises, other players. At the meso level, I engaged with the concept of structure of feelings, 
as the process through which FSs elaborate on collective affects, by enhancing positive affects which 
increase the capacity for collective action. At the micro level, I looked at how individuals get to 
mobilisation, relational ties, and long-term activism by elaborating on their affects and emotions. 
Affects are both the precondition and the matter of political participation in FSs, and through the 
collective dimension they become a tool to target social structures of inequality.  
In the following paragraph, I will look at the similarities and differences with Spanish FSs at the 
macro, meso, and micro level. How do individuals get into FSs? Are affects a driving force, as well? 

240 
 
Does the FSs’ production of community, relational ties, and repertoire of action rely on structures of 
feelings? How do FSs relate with neoliberalism, the crisis, and other players in the Spanish context? 
Several layers of analysis emerged during the fieldwork. First, the pandemic and social crisis as a 
structure  where  FSs  develop  their  meanings and  action,  by creating alternative  models  of  value 
production and strategic interaction. Second, the processual manner, which entails the process of 
becoming  safer, and thus able  to  manage  and  elaborate  on  affects;  the  forms  of  deliberative 
democracy and the repertoire of consensus-building process; the assonance between the symbolic 
field of home and the one of political spaces. Finally, I will look at the paths of participants through 
the proliferation of spaces and forms of political participation due to the specificities of the Spanish 
case and the use of affects as the basis for intersectional ties.  
 
 
9.3.1 Agency and Structure  
 
The argument of this research is that the politicisation of affects allows FSs to increase the potential 
for collective action. How does the development of the potential for collective action through affects 
work at the macro level? With regard to Italy, I delved into the capacity of FSs to interact with 
multiple crises by developing alternative models of value production, and with several players (local 
and international players, and the feminist movement). Rather than slowing down and disempowering 
collective action, constant attention to the structures of feelings produced in the FSs allows for the 
development of strategic choices, repertoires of action, and practices of democracy from below that 
challenge the assumptions of the economic and institutional system. With regard to the Spanish case, 
I will try to shed light on the similarities and differences, with a specific focus to the spread of the 
pandemic, and the role of institutions, which in the Spanish context, as already mentioned, are closely 
linked to the development of the feminist movement. 
 
Facing the Arena of Crisis  
With reference to the Italian cases, I focused on the crisis as an arena where manifold meanings are 
embedded. The crisis is both a condition which FSs are passing through because of their legal status, 
usually quite precarious and always perceived as attackable, and a condition of the setting, e.g. the 
economic and health crisis. The fieldwork in Spain occurred while the pandemic was unfolding, and 
these conditions strongly affected the type of fieldwork and the content of the interviews. I have 
engaged with three types of spaces: the Espacios de Igualdad (EDI), women’s spaces managed by the 
municipality; the Eskalera Karakola (EK), a self-managed feminist space that develops direct social 
actions; the Plataforma Encuentros Bolleros (PEB), a transfeminist and queer platform of encounter. 

241 
 
Since the fieldwork in Italy occurred before the start of the pandemic, I mainly explored the political 
crisis, in the sense of precariousness due to the threat of eviction, or sale at auction of the FSs’ 
buildings. Italian FSs have to interplay with this structure of meanings and opportunities by creating 
strategies of resistance and of change throughout tough times. In Spain, instead, the main meaning of 
crisis is related to the pandemic crisis. How do FSs relate with the pandemic? How do their claims, 
goals, and strategies change because of the health crisis? Is it possible to hold a sense of community 
despite the lockdown and restrictions? Are the tools elaborated by safer spaces effective in the arena 
of crisis? Can agency be developed with regard to an unfavourable structure? 
The pandemic has strongly affected FSs. They are physical places that are open and crossed by many 
people in everyday life. Part of their collective action is linked to the physical space and the activities 
that take place in the presence of the space. The pandemic has led to phases of lockdown or social 
distancing, resulting in FSs being closed for longer or shorter periods of time. As one of the EK 
interviewees explains, "the space is a space. So, if it is not used, it does not exist” (IIM5, EK, 54). 
The quote shows an equation between the existence of the FS and physical space. Physical space and 
relationships in presence are thus conditions for collective action. The physical space allows us to 
meet in presence: the body, the relationship, including the body, are the foundations of feminist 
politics. The dematerialisation of politics during the pandemic undermines one of the cornerstones of 
feminist politics. As an interviewee from EK explains, “You can't see the face” (IIM2, EK, 36). The 
pandemic prevents from being in the same space close to each other, or  requires one to wear a mask 
for most of the time. The empathic flow that produces the emotional bonds underlying feminist 
collective action is clogged by physical distancing and material barriers, such as personal protective 
equipment.  These  are  the  reasons  why  FSs  struggled  to  find  new  ways  to  keep  the  spaces  and 
collective action existing. Together with the lack of physical spaces, FSs have been prevented from 
public protests in the squares and streets, which have all but ceased with the pandemic.  
The pandemic affected the macro and micro level, e.g. with regard to the mental health of women. 
An EDI’s worker accounts for the consequences of the pandemic on the women followed by the 
space: they have been in “a greater situation of vulnerability, of emotional fragility, of depression. 
There have been many losses. In Madrid the pandemic swept through. In the first hour there were 
23,000 people dead. [...] And this has also created a climate of social mourning. [...] It has led many 
women to ask themselves if they are living the way they want to live, if they are living the life they 
want to live, sometimes death” (IM2, EDI, 44). The pandemic crisis has generated a sense of “shared 
grief,” imposing illness and death as frames of reference for the flow of daily life. Collective affects 
permeate this historical phase. These affects show negative consequences, as just mentioned, but also 
new structures of political opportunity, as the work on affects developed by the FSs shows. One PEB 

242 
 
participant develops the idea of shared grief as a positive possibility, which can bring to political 
outcomes:  
The current situation is a bit like a moment of rupture in general, like a mourning or not, that life has 
been transformed. It is no longer what it was before and it seems to me that we don't even know if it will 
ever be the same again. [...] It may seem that in this sense the collective is disarticulated and suddenly 
there is a greater individualism from this solitude. But at the same time, I believe that it can be something 
to live, something that is productive, something that is transformative, because in the end it is a feeling, 
an emotion, a grief shared by many people. (IIIM2, PEB, 30) 
 
As the quotation shows, collective affections, if elaborated at the community level, are an opportunity 
for transformation and development. In line with the FSs' efforts to produce structures of feelings that 
enhance the individual and collective capacity for action, so too during the pandemic a collective 
emotion as powerful as grief becomes a matter of collective processing. How can grief be made into 
agency, and how do FSs engage with this affect?   
First of all, several issues raised by FSs have become mainstream with the pandemic: as an example 
the cuts in healthcare budgeting and the gaps in the public health system that particularly affect 
women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people; the importance of care as a reciprocal task that allows 
people to survive; interdependence as the only way to look at community; health and the environment 
beyond the ruthless individualism produced by neoliberalism. The diffusion of this production of 
knowledge that took place within FSs spaces, and then became mainstream with the pandemic, leads 
one EK’s participant to hope that “more people than before will become aware” (IIM1, EK, 30). The 
awareness mentioned in the quote concerns the gender regime, the use of the body, neoliberalism, the 
role of health and expert knowledge. Raising awareness on these issues, during a traumatic and 
mournful event such as the pandemic, means pushing people to make a change in their own lives and 
in the social context. Affects, such as fear, grief, and sorrow can be elaborated into new tools to 
understand and to change social conditions of inequality. This action, which is typical of FSs, is put 
forward by FSs’ participants as a generalisable practice in a critical juncture. 
In front of illness and death, feminists had to reflect on the meaning of space and also on their 
individual lives. In some ways, the pandemic has opened up space to learn technological skills and 
new platforms where to perform collective action, to reach more people through the Internet, to focus 
on what a good life looks like and what tools to develop to achieve it collectively. Despite the climate 
of dramatic social disarticulation, the pandemic fostered the strengthening of a sense of community, 
of feeling part of something, increasing the tools of FSs in terms of relationships, mutual support, and 
solidarity. At the neighbourhood level, small groups helped each other with practical tasks (such as 
finding  an  oxygen  tank  or  a  saturation metre for  those  who  were  ill),  they maintained  a  daily 
relationship online, supporting each other and keeping each other up to date day by day, and the 
women followed by the EDIs were not left alone. As a PEB interviewee highlights, “affects flow 

243 
 
more” (IIIM2, PEB, 30). The situation of common negative affects, which weaken the mood for 
action, through the FSs' practices becomes an opportunity to develop the work on affects, making 
emotions  a  ground  for  increasing  self-awareness,  the  identification  of  problems,  the  tools  for 
constraining them. As an interviewee of PEB argues, during the pandemic the affective network of 
FSs worked as a practical tool for survival:  
And it is political because look at quarantine, for example, where there was apparently a political 
disarticulation towards the outside, because we couldn't move, we couldn't meet, we couldn't do 
anything... That was a political space of support, that was a space from which to bring food to a 
person who had Covid and lived alone. In other words, all that network through that.... To me, for 
example, I thought it was very powerful that it happened through that space. And that's where, 
for example, I think it's a justification for something that is also political from a personal point of 
view, that from that space, depending on the proximity to the neighbourhoods, people from the 
block were aware of people in a certain situation. And to generate a self-managed network there 
is political in itself. But this is also part of the affective aspect, isn't it? (IIIM2, PEB, 30) 
 
As I already explored with regard to the Italian cases, FSs deal with a faceted concept of crisis. In the 
perception of FSs’ participants in Spain, the contemporary health crisis is related to the economic 
crisis of 2007 and its consequences. The critical junction of 2011 changed people’s reaction to the 
crisis, movements’ organisation and institutions (Portos 2020). The 15-M campaign that reacted to 
austerity measures and neoliberalism brought people to engage with new grievances, organisations, 
and collective action. In times of unemployment, loss, depression, and social fragmentation, the 15-
M represented an occasion to channel people’s grievances and to change democracy (della Porta and 
Portos 2020). Relational ties, direct social action, and solidarity were stirred across social divisions. 
Feminist movements were part of that cycle of contention and they developed claims, discourses, and 
repertoires of action that resulted in political outcomes (Gámez Fuentes 2015). FSs’ participants 
emphasise the connection between the economic crisis and the pandemic crisis in terms of the tools 
developed to deal with either. An EDI worker that was also part of the feminist groups involved in 
the 15-M campaign argues as follows: “let's say we're kind of more used to getting out of it” (IM2, 
EDI, 44). At that time, the elaboration on the negative affects arising from the economic crisis and 
austerity measures led to demands for greater political participation and involvement in governmental 
choices,  the  function  of  community  processes  in  municipalities,  the  transformation  of  austerity 
policies  that  most  violently  affected  women  and disenfranchised people,  the  implementation  of 
welfare and public services for all. At that critical juncture, feminist movements developed practices 
and actions from the collective affects. That toolbox provided the basis on which new tools were 
added in the pandemic crisis. The loneliness and impoverishment produced by the crisis forces people 
into a state of malaise, loss of hope and planning for the future. On these negative affects participants 
try  to  build  awareness  by  widening  political  participation.  The  structure  of  crises  does  not  only 

244 
 
produce a constriction to collective action but also a structure of affect that, on the contrary, leads 
FSs to develop new models and strategies of agency.  
 
 
Dealing with Institutions 
FSs  interact  with  the  structure  of  crisis.  With  regard  to  the  Spanish  case,  I  looked  at  how  the 
mobilisation of affects increases the potential for collective action throughout the health emergency, 
too. This process allows FSs’ participants to transform negative affects, such as fear, sorrow, and 
mourning  into  sources  of  solidarity  and  affective  ties.  If the  pandemic  crisis  produces  social 
fragmentation and impoverishment, caring for one’s loved ones is a strategy for consolidating social 
ties,  nurturing  forms  of  mutualism,  and  helping  people  find  collaborative  solutions  to  material 
problems. In this sense, the work of affects does not depower strategy and tactics, but it increases the 
capacity for collective action of FSs, who can find innovative solutions to novel problems, such as 
the consequences of the pandemic. To deal with crises, FSs develop a series of relationships with 
players, such as institutions, the local context (the neighbourhood, inhabitants, other associations), 
and the feminist movement. Conducting the fieldwork at the height of the pandemic allowed me to 
understand their interactions with these players, within and beyond the health crisis.  
With different nuances depending on the political culture of the movement of the spaces, all the Italian 
cases  give  an  account  of  a  historical  distrust  with  regard  to  institutions,  in  line  with  the  anti-
institutional character that the feminist movement has had since the 1970s. As mentioned above, 
Spain  presents  relevant  differences  because  of  the  historical  path  the  feminist  movement  passed 
through. Since the 1970s, the movement has discussed the institutional option and part of the activists 
have been embedded in political parties and the electoral competition.  
With respect to the cases involved in the research, three different approaches emerge. First, the EDIs 
are fully part of the municipality. They are opened and paid by institutions, and despite most of the 
workers self-identify as feminist, they have to negotiate the work of the space step by step with the 
municipality. Second, the EK is part of autonomous feminism. Despite their birth as an occupation, 
from 2005 they signed an agreement with the municipality and they pay a monthly rent. Third, the 
PEB  is  fully  autonomous,  and  they  reject  any  type  of  flattery  by  political  parties  (such  as  from 
Podemos during the last municipal election on4 May 2021). However, for some events, such as 
festivals,  they  strategically  negotiate  resources  and  spaces  with  institutions.  As  we  can  see,  a 
separation is never completely possible, because spaces also move in an institutional arena where part 
of the possibilities, resources, and goals have to be negotiated with institutions. Yet, the aim of this 
thesis is to show how the feminist work on affects does not lead to a lower relational capacity, but 
rather to an increased potential for strategic interaction and outcomes. 

245 
 
The history of the feminist movements in Spain is an interesting case for understanding how a double-
boost strategy (from within institutions and from without) produces a higher efficacy than the choice 
for a complete autonomous path (Threlfall, Cousins and Valiente 2005, Valiente 2007). The thin line 
between institutional and autonomous FSs has led to a work of cultural and social transformation. 
First, this work produces a greater attention from governmental and non-governmental institutions on 
gender roles, gender-based violence, and equal opportunities. Second, it produces the population’s 
awareness about these issues. In this context, FSs play a crucial role, as laboratories of democracy 
and places through which the work of social transformation is processed on a daily basis, and then 
disseminated. 
The change of political opportunity structures (Tarrow 1998, Meyer 2004) influences the interaction 
between FSs and institutions. The change of the municipality of Madrid, from a leftist government to 
a right-wing one, affected the life of the EDIs. As a worker who used to be a feminist activist explains, 
the change of the government at the helm of the city changes the guidelines for the municipality's 
actions in terms of both content and resources, because the cornerstones on which the opening of the 
EDIs was based, such as the fight against gender-based violence, the need for women's autonomy and 
spaces for awareness, and the development of forms of participatory democracy, are all called into 
question: 
This change does not favour equality nor does it favour raising awareness among the general 
population. [...] But the discourse around equality is going to be very different. [...] Feminism is 
questioned by the extreme right. [...] They question gendered violence, question the complaints 
that women make. They question the rapes and they blame the immigrant and the different. These 
are the proposals that the Spanish extreme right-wing party has put forward. So, in that sense, we 
are threatened. Exactly the same as an autonomous collective. (IM2, EDI, 44) 
 
Despite the involvement in institutions, or because of that, EDIs are highly at risk, with respect to 
their  aims,  methods,  and  scope.  The  unintended  consequence  is  that  the  change  of  the  political 
opportunity structure falls on the shoulders of the teams working in the EDIs, feminist workers who, 
in addition to receiving an income, choose that work as a space for political activity. So they are the 
ones who pay the hardest consequences, in terms of stress, burnout, worry, and defence of spaces 
(both for professional and political reasons). At the same time, EDIs’ workers perceive themselves 
as a buffer against the neoliberal and conservative drift of the municipality. Institutionalised FSs can 
play  a  role  at  interfacing between  social  movements  and  institutions,  even  when  political 
opportunities for action are restricted, because from within they can preserve discourses, practices, 
and resources:  
I feel that if those of us who are in the EDI are convinced feminists, we will be able to stop the 
rise of the extreme right. In other words, I still have some hope that it is necessary for the teams 
within the equality spaces to be feminist and not let themselves be carried away by the ups and 
downs of the policies of the moment. This has had a certain personal wear and tear because deep 

246 
 
down you are stopping with your body and your mental health the attacks of the extreme right. 
But it is what we have left. If we do not resist, we are going to leave these frames. [...] If you had 
done this interview four years ago, I would have given you a very different answer, because we 
were in a happy moment in which it seemed that institutional politics and social movements went 
hand in hand. Well, not at this moment, at this moment the policies go one way and the social 
movements go the other and we are in the middle of this. (IM2, EDI, 44) 
 
This quote sheds light on the expected outcomes of FSs, which are considered as forges of democracy, 
dams for extremist drifts, and laboratories of innovation and social transformation. This conviction 
is also the push for feminists in trouble to keep spending their efforts in the struggle for the existence 
of FSs. An EDI worker who was a feminist activist talks about the democratic role of the EDI from 
her own biographical path. The transformation of social inequalities passes through public protests 
and autonomous spaces, but also through the capacity for strategic action within institutions, which 
allows access to resources and laws, in order to change them: 
I think that all generations at some point believed that we were here to change the world and that 
is something wonderful. [...] But the reality is that machismo continues, patriarchy continues in 
the feminisation of poverty, violence against women continues, cities are unsafe spaces and the 
responsibility of care is overburdened on the shoulders of women. So, as long as this reality does 
not change, feminism remains necessary, vital. [...] right now, at a global level, we are once again 
experiencing  an  explosion  of  the  feminist  movement  [...]  but  this  has  to  go  hand  in  hand. 
Institutional resources that ensure that the feminist movement and the spaces for equality continue 
to be places that democracy supports. (IM2, EDI, 44) 
 
Despite this awareness of strategic interaction with institutions, which is the main difference between 
Italy and Spain, participants of autonomous FSs complain about State feminists, who by virtue of 
their hegemonic position marginalise other voices, as in the fields of trans people, sex work, and 
racialisation. Speaking about the 8 March 2020 demonstration, one PEB participant tells of an almost 
muscular  confrontation  with  a  part  of  institutional  feminism  that  maintains  an  essentialist  and 
biologistic view of being a woman: “there were attacks, violence, kicks, and punches between this 
generation of ladies, whose feminism favours more those born women, and some components of the 
PEB. [...] We recognise that they have fought a lot for the rights of women and lesbians. But once 
again  they  have  remained  in  the  privileged  position  of  white  cis  women,  with documents and  a 
wealthy economic situation” (IIIM3, PEB, 37). This quotation illustrates a fragmented landscape in 
which not only strategic choices but also ideologies are swirling around the institutional option, as 
for example in relation to the debate on the trans law or the rights of LGBTQIA+ people currently 
taking  place  in  Spain.  The  difference  lies  in  the  different  legitimacy  in  speaking  out  between 
autonomous and institutional feminism, which, having access to formal roles and mainstream media, 
risks  making  the  claims  of  autonomous  groups  invisible.  This  overview  makes  it  clear  that 
institutions, as a structure, also play a subtly different role in Spain, in that, on the one hand, from 
within the institutional structure a shore is provided for the agency of the feminist movement, and on 

247 
 
the other hand the institutional structure becomes a constraint to the radicality of feminist demands, 
and in this sense limits agency. 
 
Dealing with “Lo Local” 
Among  the  players  involved,  the  closest  is  the  one  that  concerns  what  is  around  the  space:  the 
neighbourhood where the building is located, the people in the neighbourhood who frequent it, other 
associations, groups, committees.  
Lo local frequently recurs in the words of the interviewees as a field of relationship, thought, and 
political elaboration. What do they refer to when talking about lo local?   
I will look at the local as an arena inhabited by a number of different, interacting players. First, “the 
local” is the barrio, the neighbourhood dimension. Madrid is a city with over three million inhabitants 
(not  counting  all  undocumented  or  non-resident  people),  covering  an  area  of  over  600  square 
kilometres. From an urban and social point of view, the city is divided into neighbourhoods with an 
identity and specific characteristics associated with certain social dimensions. Belonging to a barrio 
generates certain expectations, needs, and capacity for action. Depending on the barrio, FSs develop 
certain activities, claims, and interactions. 
The barrio is composed of some human and non-human parts. From the point of view of the FS, there 
are las vecinas, women who live nearby, who are of special concern to the FS. Then there are the 
shops, the businesses, the restaurants: some of them are friendly and collaborative, as in the case of 
the EK, where the bar across the street allows them to leave the keys of the space for the various 
people they may serve. Then a more or less developed network of public services, such as health 
centres, public transport, and municipal offices, which shorten or lengthen the distances between the 
FS and its stakeholders. Then the other social and political spaces. The urban dimension, such as the 
type of lighting, public transports, which also includes the more general question of gentrification, is 
always a structure where the agency of free spaces is put to the test (Caciagli 2021). Gentrification, 
which in Madrid is a huge process and specifically in neighbourhoods such as Lavapies (where the 
EK  is  located), influences the  cost  of  rents,  the  type  of  businesses,  the  changing  face  of  the 
neighbourhood,  but  also  the  changing  social  composition.  Each barrio has  a  certain  social 
composition and class stratification. With regard to all this, FSs develop their strategies and tactics.  
The  FS  enhances  the  awareness  on  gender  dynamics  through  publicising  the  space's  events  and 
meetings,  meeting  women  in  the  neighbourhood,  and  supporting  women's  self-organisation.  The 
possibility to experience a safer space becomes first a curiosity, and then a real opportunity for women 
to transform their lives. Working with the neighbourhood enables contact with women from different 
social backgrounds, who experience different levels of social status, work conditions, racialisation. 

248 
 
An  interviewee  of  the  EK  recounts  the  intersectional  dimension  of  the  FS,  which  intercepts  the 
racialised  component  of  the  neighbourhood,  and  through  dialogue  builds  alliances  and  common 
actions: “we do a work of contact and of being, with our bodies, with women from different countries 
who live here in Lavapies, a multicultural work. So we are working on listening and walking together, 
to see what we can do with our differences, without imposing anything at all and listening that they 
have opinions as opposed to ours, as white Europeans, without postponing, braking, whipping. But 
being clear that I am not superior to others. On the contrary, to have a grassroots work that we do 
together” (IIM3, EK, 54). Taking care of the space also means taking care of the territory, of the 
neighbourhood,  of las  vecinas.  To  root  collective  action  in  a  specific  urban  sector  allows  for 
developing the politics of small things, such as not making noise so as not to disturb the neighbour.  
The case of the PEB, too, which is not properly a space, is useful to understand the relation with the 
urban dimension. Despite the lack of a physical face, or maybe thanks to this, the PEB inhabits a lot 
of different spaces and barrios, with the aim to spread the safer space to all the places they are passing 
through. This molecular strategy changes the idea of a stable and physical localisation, by opening 
the possibility for a different relation with the city and for a broadening of the spectrum of social 
categories a feminist group can relate with.  
The three cases show that FSs have to interact with several parts of the urban context: the architectural 
configuration; the social composition; the other compound players. The work on collective affects 
allows them to develop empathy and care, as social skills that enhance the creation of networks and 
alliances.  
 
The Feminist Movement  
What does the awareness of affects and emotions produce? How do emotions help FSs to move in 
the world and act in relation to the context and a range of different actors?  
In the previous sections, according to what emerged from the participants' accounts, I observed their 
way of acting in relation to the context of the pandemic and economic crisis, and in relation to 
institutional and local actors. Another significant relationship is that with the feminist movement.  
FSs are part of the feminist movement: they preserve culture, practices, and claims from one phase 
of mobilisation to another; they act out the movement's prefigurative politics in their daily lives; and 
they sediment the social transformations proposed by the movement.  
The  timespan  of  the  research  goes  from  2017  to  2021.  In  this  period,  a  new  cycle  of  feminist 
mobilisations spread globally (Barone and Bonu forthcoming, Gago 2021): from Argentina with the 
name of Ni Una Menos, to Italy with the name of Non Una di Meno, to Spain, around the feminist 
strike of the 8 March. The fieldwork took place during a phase of high visibility and mobilisation of 

249 
 
the  feminist  movement. What relations  occur  between  FSs  and  the  feminist  movement?  Which 
boundaries and which areas overlap between the two? How do they mutually strengthen each other, 
or not?  
Drawing sharp lines between the feminist movement and FSs is never entirely possible. Activists 
often cross both spaces of collective action and consider themselves both as part of the feminist 
movement as a whole and of a specific FS. The feminist movement in Spain is organised around 
certain public moments, such as 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence 
Against Women, 28 June, the day of Orgullo Critico. The most important date, however, is 8 March, 
when the international women's strike has taken place since 2017. The #8M is organised through an 
assembly for each neighbourhood, and a city assembly that brings all together. Very often the #8M 
assemblies are held in FSs of neighbourhoods, or at least in spaces that have a strong feminist imprint. 
Because of this, it is difficult to untangle the boundaries between forms of participation. However, 
we can identify at least two processes. On the one hand, the function of FSs as vanguards of the 
feminist movement, and on the other  FSs as chains of transmission of the demands made by the 
movement. 
Generally, FSs work as laboratories of thoughts, ideas, and practices. Participants convey the wonder 
to realise how far FSs brought ideas forward, as an interviewee of the EK explains: “it was that feeling 
of  constant  surprise  about  what  was  produced  there.  Also  all  devices  to  think  about,  above  all 
enormously novel, and then it's been like years that part of them have been more or less accepted by 
the feminist movement” (IIM5, EK, 54). As Taylor argues, structures of abeyance have the capacity 
to preserve repertoires of ideas and action and to elaborate innovations for mobilisations to come 
(1989). As an example, the creation of “Territorio domestico” in the EK, the collective of domestic 
workers and caregivers, was one of the first attempts to connect with a global dimension of activism, 
across borders, languages, and cultures, and also a first attempt at organising a quite unorganisable 
sector such as the one of reproductive labour. As an interviewee of the EK develops, the connection 
between the local and the global was developed within the FS and by virtue of the everyday work of 
alliances: “there was a global vision of militancy in the 1990s, but the fact that the workers were not 
a collective from Nicaragua or Brazil, but were people who were here, I think that made it very 
difficult to forget that the struggle was always taken to the global system. That it is not a question of 
alliances, it was a question of everything being connected” (IIM5, EK, 54).  
Autonomous groups also work as guardians of some instances of the feminist movement, by limiting 
the encroachments of political parties. As an example, during 8 March 2019, there was almost a 
physical confrontation between trans-exclusionary feminism and the PEB, because they wanted to 
occupy the first part of the march with their banner. The movement, then, becomes the field of 

250 
 
confrontation between its cultures and ideologies. By virtue of their everyday work, FSs preserve the 
boundaries between the autonomous dimension of the movement and the institutional dimension, 
protecting its autonomy and innovation. As an interviewee of the PEB argues: “they came as very 
clear to sabotage the #8M demonstration and capitalise it with their proclamations in front of the 
official banner of the #8M and we confronted them. It was a very symbolic issue, wasn't it?”  (IIIM4, 
PEB, 54). 
Finally,  FSs  work  as a chain  of  transmission  of  ideas,  needs,  and practices.  The  EDIs,  that  are 
managed by the municipality, cannot be directly involved in the organisation of the #8M. Because of 
their institutional status, they cannot formally be part of assemblies and collectives. However, an EDI 
worker claims that “we have a link, a kind of interlocution with the assemblies, which are the Equality 
Tables of each district, so the Equality Tables are autonomous people who transmit to us the specific 
demands that the feminist movement has for 8 March and we interface with them through the district's 
Equality Table” (IM2, EDI, 44). The double-boost effect allows FSs to be effective in broadening 
democratic margins. On one hand, they are involved in grasping and elaborating affects, emotions, 
troubles, and needs coming from women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people. On the other hand, 
FSs closer to institutions receive this information and transmit it through their institutional channels 
in order to make it into practical applications, services, and provisions. 
The Spanish cases allow to broaden the understanding of the interaction between agency and structure 
through the mediation of affect. Despite the apparent constraint of the opportunities provided by the 
structure, as in the case of the pandemic crisis, the work of the FSs on affect (which in Spain has a 
long genealogy also thanks to the mobilisations of 15-M) allows them to implement and transform 
agency. This development can also be observed in relation to the relationship with institutions, the 
local context, and the feminist movement. The peculiar condition of feminism in Spain, which is also 
implicated in institutional venues, helps to highlight different levels of formalisation of the work on 
affects, and different possible outcomes.  
 
 
9.3.2 Transforming Affects into Action  
 
With regard to the Italian cases I explored the work on affects pursued by FSs as 1) a channel of 
mediation between cognition and body, 2) a tool for political elaboration, and 3) a competence in 
action.  The  notion  of  safer  spaces,  often  raised  by  participants,  came  to  be  the  most  visible 
manifestation of a deeper and widespread work on the emotional matter (on affects and emotions of 
participants, on collective affects, and on affects involved in collective action). This familiarisation 
with the field of affects generates a structure of feelings in which participants change their disposition 

251 
 
and orientation, feeling more willing to act, less exposed to the risks resulting from the gender regime, 
more secure. This work of approaching affects and understanding them is a process in which there is 
no lack of conflict, negative affect, and distancing on the part of the participants. At the same time, it 
is the process, and thus the feeling that things can be continually negotiated and transformed, that 
fuels the feeling of safety. In this sense, affects are continuously transformed through collective action 
and into collective action. I will look at the same relational and processual manner in the Spanish 
cases. While several elements recur, others emerged with more intensity in the FSs in Spain. First, I 
will closely look at the work of affects and emotions as a proxy to increase the capacity for collective 
action. Cuidado (“care”)  emerges  as  a  framework  in  which  a  series  of  affects  are  negotiated, 
protected, and made productive of collective action. The processing of affect takes place through a 
certain  form  of  organisation  and  deliberation.  In  this  sense,  practices  of  internal  democracy  are 
illustrative of the transformation of affects into strategies, organisation, and action. Finally, I will 
focus on the association between the idea of home and the FSs, which also emerged in the Italian 
cases, and which is telling of the spatialisation of collective affects. 
 
Becoming Safer  
 
I don't need to be in there to protect myself from the world. Here we create things that we couldn't do otherwise. 
I mean, it kind of allows ideas, practices, things to emerge (IIM2, EK, 36) 
 
FSs stimulate the participants' perception of security through the construction structures of feelings 
in which emotions, organisation, and time change according to a relational effort. In this section, I 
will explore on one hand the work on affects, and on the other the ethics of care pursued by FSs to 
preserve the structures of feelings.  
 
Affects as a Boost to the Perception of Safety  
 
In the Spanish cases, as well, positive affects emerge as tools to increase the capacity for collective 
action. Wonder and joy bound up individual mobilisation paths, and the first contact with the FS. 
Wonder and joy strengthen the will to participate and enhance the eventful moments in the life of the 
FSs. These moments, bound up by positive affects, entrench collective action. As an interviewee of 
the PEB outlines with regard to positive affects, “I remember that it was an infinite joy because it was 
like putting the body in the centre. To put it with joy, to be visible and to do it well... [...] to be well, 
to build this community together occupying the streets, raising our voices and above all putting it at 
the centre of the speeches or lemmas that concerned our lives” (IIM4, EK, 47). Thus, positive affects 
are heavily connected to the bodily dimension. They belong to the body and they allows politics to 

252 
 
put the body at the centre. Positive affects developed within FSs are so strongly connected with 
participants’ paths that an interviewee accounts that, otherwise, “I would die of depression... I think 
that for us it is something vital” (IIIM4, PEB, 54). Positive affects emerge from affective ties: they 
rely on feelings of trust, care, and interdependence. Compared to the neoliberal habit of loneliness 
and competition, feminist bonds strengthen people’s capacity to perform action together, and in this 
sense they increase the perception of the potential for collective action. As an interviewee of the PEB 
argues:  
This affective link is a driving force within the political sphere, because it also moves you to 
attend a space, to go to a demonstration. There is a moment when you feel even more challenged 
because something else is being generated, perhaps beyond the mere political slogan, which is 
extremely interesting. [...] I do believe that in this area it has generated, or at least when I was 
part of it, quite solid and transformative networks, in some senses. (IIIM2, PEB, 30) 
 
Negative emotions are part of the structures of feelings produced by FSs, where engagement and 
disengagement  occur.  Frustration,  rage,  and  disillusion  are  powerful  feelings that lead  people to 
drastically change their relation with the space. Negative emotions are the material of collective work, 
such as that regarding fear. As an interviewee of EK develops, the emotion changes when it is shared 
and addressed: feminist politics transform the approach, the nature, and the reaction to those emotions 
that can render one powerless, “because when I am there I do not feel in danger. When we do a 
political action, we go together. Fear is shared” (IIM3, EK, 54). 
The challenge to neoliberal time contributes to the feeling of safety. As I previously outlined with 
regard to the Italian cases, FSs are based on a different temporality that tries to avoid the classical 
social movement’s agenda. The same goes for the Spanish cases, which are always balancing their 
collective action between traditional protest dates (such as 8 March, 25 November, and so on) and 
the need to take time for themselves. As an interviewee of the EDIs argues with regard to participation 
in their space, “when you come here, the activities you do are not something you do because you 
need to do it for your capitalist productive life. If you come here, you come to dance, to paint, or to 
learn to read and use the mobile phone, but because you want to, and in the end you are giving yourself 
a space for yourself. And I think that generates security, [...] I think it gives security, that the group 
supports the load that you bring. You are no longer alone” (IM3, EDI, 37). As the quote shows, a 
strict interdependency exists between FSs, affects, actions, and the challenge to neoliberalism. By 
taking the time to develop the self, to discuss with others, and to elaborate strategic goals, FSs build 
their collective action upon a political understanding of affects, which are usually foreclosed by 
neoliberal social structures. Emotions shore up political participation and individual resources to 
participate  (Goodwin  and  Jasper  2003).  Feminist  contributions  to  affect  theory  highlight  the 

253 
 
transformative potential of affect: when they are shared, named, and engaged with, they increase the 
power of collective action (Gregg and Seigworth 2010).  
 
Ethics of Care to Preserve Structures of Feelings  
As I previously explored, historically care has been a social function delegated to women, who were 
– and still are – supposed to take care of the well-being and survival of all members of their family 
(Friedan 1963, Rowbotham 1979). The reappropriation of care is an achievement of the feminist 
movement, that claims interdependency and care as a tool for survival for all. As an interviewee 
explains, the act of taking care in FSs is oriented to the creation of the physical and emotional space 
that makes participants feel good. With regard to Italian cases, I called it the ethics of care, which 
preserves the structures of feelings FSs draw upon. As a PEB interviewee argues, FSs are “espacios 
de cuidado [spaces of care] [...] more aimed at the inside, at the group... they aim at taking care of the 
space also as a political action... political action is not only going out in the street and slaughter, 
political action is also taking care of the space and creating a safe space where you can discuss issues” 
(IIIM1, PEB, 24). By broadening the repertoire of action that FSs recur to in order to pursue social 
change,  participants  add  to  public  protest  the  dimension  of  caring  for  one’s intimate  life  and 
community space as a political action for change. This ethics of care is so strong that people feel it 
from their first step into the spaces, as recounted by an interviewee of the EK: “from the very first 
moment, it seemed to me the most welcoming place I had ever found” (IIM5, EK, 54). People need 
a safer space “to breathe” and to defend themselves from a world perceived as “extremely hostile” 
(IIM5, EK, 54). To feel good, though, is not an individualistic exercise that is part of neoliberalism, 
but a political action that recasts well-being as a transformative affect that increases the individuals' 
capacity for action.  
Caring  spaces  are  not  free  from  dangers:  as  an  interviewee of  the  EK  elaborates  on,  people  are 
socialised to social structures and they keep reproducing social structures of inequalities. “I don't 
think it's a 100 percent safe space, because in the end we are traversed by all the things that socialise 
us in society” (IIM2, EK, 36). Things can happen, and no one is completely safe from everything. 
However, things can be constantly addressed, and this space for collective elaboration lets people feel 
safer. An EK interviewee calls it “a space of affinity, even if it has affinity in the margins. That there 
is freedom, and by freedom I mean not doing what you like, a freedom that we decide together what 
it is. A shared freedom” (IIM4, EK, 47). Activists share an informal agreement on some elements of 
respect, mutual acknowledgment, and care. In the perimeter of the agreements they interact and move, 
by balancing the presence in public protests and the internal work on consciousness rising.

In this paragraph, I went through the production of safer spaces as a process. First, I looked at the 
processual  approach  to  emotions  and  affects.  Then,  I  looked  at  FSs  as  caring  spaces,  based  on 
informal  political  agreements,  which  guarantee  certain  feelings  and  tools  to  be  addressed  at  the 
collective level. Finally, as proved by the Italian cases, this work increases the capacity for collective 
action both at the individual and collective levels.   
 
Practices of Internal Democracy  
Safer  spaces  are  something  that  feminist  communities do,  they  are  collective  action,  relational 
processes.  In  the  previous  paragraph,  I  went  through  the  structure  of  feelings  that  participants 
establish, that is the precondition, the matter, and the framework of FSs’ collective action. Here, I 
will focus on the decision-making process. I will explore how practices of internal democracy, of 
deliberative process, repertoire of action, and cognitive and bodily practices generate more liveable 
types  of  collective  action,  where  people  are  not  overridden  by  predefined  mechanisms  but 
continuously negotiate the setting, goals, and methods. My argument is that this effort of elaboration 
on  the  decision-making  process,  informed  by  the  work  on  affects,  transforms  the  participants’ 
disposition  to  take  part  in  political  action,  increases  their  willingness  to  participate, and  their 
convictions.  Della  Porta  calls  this  process  “meeting  democracy”  (2005,  2009,  2013a,  2013b)  by 
referring to the way social movements “prefigure various models of democracy within their own 
organizations” (2013: 3). In the case of FSs, these practices are oriented to subvert the gender regime 
that  interplays  with  structural  gender-based  violence,  by  producing  social  inequalities  and 
individualism (Pain 2001, Pulcini 2001). The stress on consensus, respectful communication, care of 
the  space  and  of  relationships  is  part  of  a  feminist  reflection  on  decision-making  processes  and 
organisation, by means of affects.  
FSs are intended to be open and welcoming. More than a slogan, this is a way to produce spaces 
informed by care (of the physical space and of the participants), and by the attention to people’s 
willingness to join. All the interviewees report similar feelings when they get into the space for the 
first time: “they were open assemblies, you could go and it was very easy to talk to people. Very 
welcoming. For me it was a relief, because it was finally a space where I could participate and I didn’t 
feel like a stranger” (IIM2, EK, 37). The tension toward the outside and the aim to reach as many 
participants as possible derives from an understanding of the social context in which, regardless of 
gender, class, racialisation, and age differences, people deserve a space for themselves.  
The first step to address the issue of the decision-making process and organisation is the creation of 
a welcoming space. Then comes the repertoire of practices of assembly. With regard to Spain, all the 
autonomous spaces involved in the research show a toolbox of micro-practices to manage assemblies. 

255 
 
Usually, two or more persons are identified for facilitation, which consists in drawing up the agenda, 
managing the assembly, taking turns to speak, monitoring speaking time, writing the final report, and 
welcoming  new  people.  The  facilitators  rotate  at  each  assembly,  so  these  roles  are  mobile  and 
interchangeable. These practices favour the approach of outsiders and a participatory discussion of 
the  nodes.  As  an  interviewee  of  the  EK  claims,  it  is  an  assemblage  of  behaviours  and  bodily 
dispositions which changes the setting of the assembly: “the respect in the assemblies, the listening, 
the tone of voice, not having to ask for a voice, [...] that the comrades were always attentive to 
whoever wanted to speak, [everything] was given very much in contrast to the continuous struggle to 
take the floor in the mixed assemblies. It already seemed a revolution to me” (IIM5, EK, 54). Feminist 
approaches to assembly increase people’s will to participate by creating positive feelings with regard 
to the decision-making process. Yet, the strict codification of assembly practices generates some 
unintended consequences. On the one hand, they sometimes risk masking rather than eliminating 
power dynamics and informal roles. The narrative on positive assembly practices risks constraining 
the openness to criticism, self-criticism, and the ability to cope with highly critical situations. On the 
other hand, it risks oversimplifying discussions, with one/three-minute speeches, the possibility for 
everyone to speak, but a less in-depth analysis of arguments and strategies. Processes of consensus-
building are slow, and decisions can take a long time.  
Because of their institutional status, the EDIs do not follow the same mechanisms of autonomous 
spaces. Hierarchies exist, as much as formal roles, tasks, and top-down trajectories of planning. As 
an interviewee of an EDI explains, “we are a team of feminist women who are also trying, because 
we all believe in self-defence within this capitalist productivist system. We take care of each other 
and look for ways to make decisions as a team. But we also have a boss, a manager, and a coordinator 
who, in the end, are the ones in charge of taking decisions, and we have clear lines of work” (IM3, 
EDI,  37).  Because  of  their  positionality – as  workers  and  feminists – they  often  run  into 
contradictions. Yet, they keep the idea of participatory deliberation, by educating women attending 
the EDIs to meet, discuss, and pursue collective decisions. Quite interestingly, one of the interviewee 
explains the need for both autonomous feminist places and institutional feminist places in order to 
achieve the goal of social change. In this sense, women are invited to participate in both, because 
only in the work inside/outside the institutions a widespread change of social inequalities is possible: 
“my aim is that women come here, but that they don't stop going to the Eskalera Karakola. [...] Public 
resources should never replace community work and the role of associations. On the contrary. Our 
role is to promote associations among women and ourselves. Here we encourage women to meet and 
form associations among themselves” (IM3, EDI, 37). 

256 
 
FSs  deeply  engage  with  innovating  practices.  Alternative  practices  can  serve  to  dismantle  the 
boundaries  that  social  movements  typically  encounter,  such  as  accessibility,  the  capacity  to 
communicate,  the diffusion  of  claims.  In  the  case  of  EDIs,  they  blur  the  boundaries  between 
institutions  and  women,  between  feminist  practices  and  organisational  hierarchies,  between 
sustainable economy and budgetary duty. Within the EK, participants engaged with the creation of a 
radio – Sangre Fucsia – as a tool to "break the barrier of the private to enter the public and break the 
barrier of the small to enter the large" (IIM4, EK, 47). An autonomous radio enabled them to develop 
knowledge production and to spread the FS’s message far beyond the circles that could physically 
access it. The PEB, instead, created the Lineas Rojas Y Verdes, that is a group that discusses “the 
boundaries of the PEB's political action” (IIIM4, PEB, 54). As a PED’s participant explains:  
We have formulated a kind of trust lines. We call them red lines and green lines. And those 
decisions [...] have to be within green lines and cannot touch the red lines. So, bright green lines: 
we are feminist, trans, anti-fascist, anti-racist, anti-capitalist. We want to be on this political line... 
[...] like if there are any proposals or any ideas related to political party issues, we would have to 
consult them. The issue of sex work or prostitution is a controversial issue right now, a red line 
(IIIM3, PEB, 37) 
 
The  red  and  green  lines  are  an  example  of  an  attempt  to  manage  a  very  inclusive  space  and  a 
composition crossed by differences, through a pact established from time to time on the sharing of 
themes. These innovative practices try to link creativity with strategic action, within a structure of 
feelings that enhances positive affects and limits the proliferation of negative affects.  
As I have explored with regard to the Italian cases, FSs often make use of playing and performances 
as a tool to innovate their repertoire of action. Playing activates different channels of interaction with 
reality, and it increases people's willingness to participate. A striking case in point is the EK's Feminist 
Trivial Pursuit, a game created for fun and designed for a hundred people that has since sold to 
hundreds of thousands of people. An interviewee tells the story of the game, by claiming the role of 
playing and having fun as subversion of neoliberal temporality and individualism: “It's a wonderful 
thing to find oneself playing because it seems one of these dimensions that for the kind of life we 
live, it seems that there is no place for the game at all [...]. You see, there was a need and a desire for 
a game that talked about us, to be together doing something fun and learning as well” (IIM4, EK, 47). 
The collective action of playing disentangles the rhythm of the neoliberal production system that 
requires  people’s  productivity  and  the  compression  of  leisure  and  non-remunerative  activities. 
Another similar example is the game Escape Room from the Patriarchy, performed at the EK during 
the period of easing of the pandemic measures. The game was meant to be a time for people to have 
fun, doing something practical together, and thinking in game form about an ideal feminist world to 
pursue. The story of the escape room was that participants to the game are in 2021 in the pandemic 
and  the  space  of  the  EK is  almost  abandoned.  Participants  have  received a message  from  the 

257 
 
transfeminists of the future in 2047: in the future they live in such a happy transfeminist system. So 
there is no need for the EK, and they have abandoned the space. But in 2047 there is a coup d'état 
looming, and the feminists of the future do not know what to do because they say that it will come to 
participants in a macho, patriarchal, military state, and they do not know how to organise themselves. 
And so they ask the feminists of 2021 to help them resist. An interviewee of the EK, who organised 
the game, explains how they challenged participants through playing together, to reflect upon feminist 
issues and strategic solutions: “the groups [of participants to the game] come and we do tests for 
them. They have to look for the feminist symbol, then they have to know how to sing slogans, then a 
song... [...] And then at the end [...] groups have to collaborate with each other to find the key. And 
the key is transfeminist sisterhood. With this you can open the zoom, a kind of zoom where the 
transfeminists of the future are connected [...]. The answer to save the future, to save them, is to 
invent, to keep the transfeminist spaces active until 2047” (IIM2, EK, 37). As the quote shows, the 
game enhances people’s awareness on feminist ties (what she calls sisterhood), and on the role of 
FSs. On a symbolic level, to save the world from patriarchy and the militarist state, FSs are needed 
in which to invent alternative worlds and prefigurative politics. The use of games serves to develop 
the imagination and to engage with the idea of the future. This playful, creative, innovative work on 
imaginaries is a way to let people participate with other capacities than the cognitive one. If the 
pandemic has narrowed down the horizons of the future, both as individuals and as a community, 
through innovative practices participants try again to confront the idea of the future, stimulating 
positive emotions linked to having fun, pleasure, and happiness. Here again it is clear how positive 
affects increase the potential for collective action, even in times of health and social crisis.  
The creation of knowledge based on experience and collaboration is also part of the repertoire of FSs. 
Experiences like Precarias a la Deriva – one of the first groups on women and the precariat – or 
Territorio Domestico – a group of self-organised care givers – made the history of the Spanish (and 
beyond) production of knowledge on these topics, and they had the chance to happen within FSs.  
The creation of tools for internal democracy is even more needed when FS stumble into the problem 
of gender-based violence or internal harassment. In those cases, there is a strong need for tools, which 
in most cases fail, and have led spaces such as the PEB to develop a kind of protocol for handling 
cases of internal violence. The failure to manage internal violence produces consequences on the 
activists’  perception,  as  an  EK  interviewee  reports:  “we  have  a  problem  with  the  ideology  [...] 
especially if the name of horizontality actually hides conflicts. [...] We didn't know how to react... 
and in that sense when I was talking about safe spaces I would say, is it a safe space? I don't know. 
Probably not. Not for all” (IIM4, EK, 47).  

258 
 
In the section, I tried to focus on the innovative practices that come out of the creation of certain 
structures of feelings. First, because of the work on collective affects, FSs in Spain engage with the 
creation  of  welcoming  spaces  (both  at  the  physical  and  actual  level),  where  people  feel  free  to 
participate.  Second,  they  deeply  engage  with  bodily  and  relational  practices  of  decision-making 
processes, in order to enhance horizontal participation. This effort comes with contradictions, when 
it prevails over further critics to be addressed, because of the supposed innovative practices they 
adopt. As in the Italian cases, the role of playing and performances emerged in Spain as a tool to 
develop collective action beyond the cognitive level. The processual approach to the decision-making 
process does not make contradictions disappear. Instead, in the capacity to address contradictions, 
participants establish the ground for safer spaces.  
 
It Feels Like Home 
With  regard  to  the  Italian  cases,  an  unexpected  association  between  FSs  and  the  idea  of  home 
emerged. Most of the interviewees, asked about their relation with the political space they belong to, 
ended up answering with the same sentence: “it feels like home.” I found that correlation quite striking 
because of the entangled history and symbols that compose the idea of home in western thought.  
It  was  even  more  striking  to  find  the  same  correlation  in  the  words  of  Spanish  feminists.  With 
reference to the EK, a participant accounts for a double reason for this association. On one hand, 
because of the practical expertise (familiarity with the technicians who fix any problems with the 
space, care in dealing with the needs and problems of the physical space), and on the other hand 
because of the temporal issue: the daily time of one's life is divided between the private home and the 
FS, so the perception of intimacy is extended to the political space, through the grafting of space, 
one’s biographical path, and community: “I always say that it's like my second home. I live in the 
house and I always have the key when the person who checks the boiler comes. Can you open it? 
Yes, I can. [...] It’s my second home. My living room is the same. I spend the same amount of time 
in my living room as I do here” (IIM2, EK, 36). 
Referring to the quote, with respect to the Spanish cases, some insights emerge about the relationship 
between FSs and the idea of home: the management of physical space; the act of caring; affective 
relations; affect; temporality.  
The  relationship  with  the  physical  space  is  established  on  a  bodily  element:  it  is  a  material 
relationship, it concerns the knowledge of the space, its objects, and corners. It influences bodily 
sensations of participants. Participants know every part of the space, they clean the space as if it were 
home, they know what is missing (pens, water, toilet paper, and so on). As one of the EK interviewees 
recounts, the knowledge of the space produces a bodily sensation of well-being, as when the interior 

259 
 
elements in one's own home evoke a familiarity, and the idea of one's own place, in which to feel 
good: “it is a question of being comfortable somewhere you know perfectly well” (IIM4, EK, 47).  
Participants know every nook and corner of the FS because they take care of it. The action of cleaning, 
tidying up, checking that everything works, is a practical action that concerns the physical space, but 
also a symbolic action that concerns taking care of the collective project. Taking care of the space is 
also a tool to create community. Everyone can contribute, and the more people get in contact with the 
space, its furniture and needs, the more they get close to the FS. The opportunity to occupy a space 
together becomes an opportunity to meet and broaden one’s political participation, and in this sense 
there is a connection between intimacy, affects, space, and politics. As an interviewee of the EK 
states: 
We call them red days, we put it on Twitter, on Facebook, and so we bring together everybody 
who wants to come and help. “We're going to do a big clean up because we have a lot of shit” 
and then so and so people come [...] It's like that collective feeling of a house, but it's like the 
same thing you would do at home. [...] It's like this feeling of... Like we would be in a house 
doing something together and chatting, but also doing something for the space. (IIM2, EK, 36) 
 
Home is about doing something together, about spending time together and building a network of 
affects through practical activities (Gusmano forthcoming). In this sense, FSs are perceived as home 
because they subvert the idea of the nuclear family, by establishing homes where chosen emotional 
ties take place. As an interviewee of the EK argues, FSs give the chance  “to cultivate bonds that are 
not... Family in the pejorative sense of the word” (IIM4, EK, 47). The private home is supposed to be 
the site of bonds and affects. In a broader sense, home is also the place we share with people who 
know ourselves, our personalities, skills, faults, and needs. In this sense, Spanish participants to FSs 
add a shift in understanding the correlation between FSs and home: home is where someone else 
recognises  us,  as  individual,  emotional,  social,  and  political  subjects.  The  concept  of  inhabiting 
recovers a human need, that of knowing where to place oneself, knowing what to return to, and where 
one's roots are, and this need is also political. As the quote further develops, “it's about knowing that 
it's  a  place  where  you  are  recognised. And  that  it's  not  univocal,  it's  a  mutual  recognition...  we 
recognise each other as inhabitants of the EK, inhabitants of the feminist and transfeminist world or 
because we worked together on something specific” (IIM4, EK, 47).  
In this connection of practical activities, geographies, and affects lies the mark of the reconciliation 
between private and public spaces. Spaces are grounded in the personal and political. So it comes that 
homeliness, as a structure of feelings, is telling of the collective action pursued by FSs by means of 
affects: “it's intimate and political at the same time [...].  Well yes, it's like a public space, but then 
in the end you become intimate with things” (IIM2, EK, 36). Beyond private and public, FSs are 
places in which boundaries are different than the private home, and the positive elements of home are 

260 
 
taken up and mixed together to produce the structure of feelings where women, lesbians, trans, and 
non-binary people increase their capacity for collective action. The role of positive affects emerges 
as a boost for action, as an interviewee of the EK develops: “a home that means a place of intimacy 
where you feel good, where you feel comfortable, welcomed. And where there are no dangers” (IIM4, 
EK, 47). 
In these sections, I went through the process of transforming affects into action, at the micro and 
meso level. The creation of structures of feelings where affects act as mediation between cognition 
and  body,  as  tools  for  political  elaboration,  and  as  competence  in  action  allows  Spanish  FSs  to 
increase their scope of participation, and also their capacity for collective action.  
 
 
9.3.3 Paths of Participants  
 
 
At the beginning of the chapter, I explored the herstory of the feminist movement in Spain, through 
Franco’s regime and in the following decades of democratic building process. This herstory produces 
enduring effects on today’s activism and partially shapes the way people mobilise for feminism. How 
does the work on affects interplay with people’s willingness to participate in FSs? Which similarities 
and differences occur among paths of participation in Spain and Italy?  
 
Proliferation of Feminist Political Participation 
Compared to the Italian context, in Spain I observed a widespread politicisation over feminist claims: 
walls, bars, streets, offices, institutions are heavily scored by the influence of feminist discourses. 
Political participation is widespread and there is a sensitivity to feminism that extends to layers of the 
population differing in gender, age, sexuality, race, class, and so on. Even though this does not allow 
for a generalisation about the fall of patriarchy, it undoubtedly reveals the movement's ability to affect 
mass culture and common sense. While in Italy a great separation exists between small and hyper-
politicised groups versus mainstream gender politics, and we cannot claim for a full entrance of 
feminist discourses in public debates, Spain presents quite the opposite case. These elements produce 
effects on political participation, because of and beyond feminist mainstreaming. I call this process 
proliferation, by referring to the widespread sensitivity to the existence and right to self-organise and 
self-determination of women and LGBTQ people. In this sense, the work on affects is part of a 
widespread,  everyday  toolbox.  At  the  micro  level,  people  tend  to  incorporate  elements  of  FSs’ 
practices into their daily lives. The contamination of feminism at the level of mass culture changes 
the forms of political participation.  

261 
 
In addition to this widespread politicisation, FSs enhance the individuals’ paths of engagement. In 
Italy, FSs are ideally built for all women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people, while in reality they 
bring  together  highly  politicised  people  with  access  to  a  certain  kind  of  symbolic  and  material 
resources. In Spain, the idea that these spaces should exist is a common notion which is also part of 
institutional  awareness. With  regard  to  the  EDIs  managed  by  the  municipality,  an  interviewee 
comments: “women have found their safe place here, and now more and more we manage to make 
institutional spaces more flexible to be able to incorporate the fact that this group of women are also 
feeling that these spaces are theirs” (IM1, EDI, 42). The audience of safer spaces are realistically 
intended to be all women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people. It is not by chance that the city of 
Madrid  provides seventeen spaces  for  women  in which:  “Madrid  City  Council  is  committed  to 
promoting equality and eliminating violence. [...] There is a sensitised technician who decides to set 
up spaces like these, because women, once they have received initial attention, need a space where 
they can be repaired, trained and, above all, the population needs to be made much more aware” (IM1, 
EDI,  42).  Women  from  many  different  social  backgrounds,  not  necessarily  activists,  get  to  FSs 
because of the need for a space for themselves: “that's the first thing they all say. I want to come here 
to disconnect from what I have in my life, to not think, to have some time for myself and to find a 
space for myself” (IM3, EDI, 37). These quotations show how it is possible to broaden the concept 
of  political  participation  to  include  a  broader  willingness  of  groups,  institutions,  and  parties  to 
enhance individual awareness, and therefore social change. As the following quote shows even more 
clearly, institutions embed feminist claims, and their services are informed by this sensitivity: “there 
are  some  material  resources  and  there  is  a  feminist  proposal  from  the  team  to  accompany  and 
politicise as well. [...] I think that there is something here about taking feminism to the everyday life 
and to the public space” (IM3, EDI, 37). 
An  effect  of  the  proliferation  is  that  in  the  field  of  autonomous  organisations,  while  feminist 
collectives are present all over social centres, neighbourhood’s organisations, and so on, feminist-
only spaces are more rare. Feminist claims and practices are part of an everyday life pattern, and they 
are  interconnected  with  other  claims  (e.g.  on  the  environment,  on  work  and  pauperisation,  on 
migration and racialisation). As an EK interviewee explains, “all the occupied spaces in Madrid are 
feminist because feminism has arrived so strongly that if you occupy you should have a feminist 
perspective” (IIM4, EK, 47). 
The proliferation and multiplication of feminist perspectives depend on the organisational structures 
of the feminist movements in Spain, as developed by an EK interviewee: “one of the things that 
surprised me and that somehow makes it possible to participate here even if you are not part of any 
collective is that there are many dates marked so that around the marked dates which is 8 March, 25 

262 
 
November, 28 June, there is a collective organisation of the event and there are temporary assemblies 
in which whoever wants to participates can do it” (IIM4, EK, 47). More open, mobile, and fluid 
structures allow people to feel free to enter and participate in a variable way, regardless of their 
background. In this sense, the concept of feminist political participation is less tied to rigid protocols 
of recruitment, engagement, and continuity. Participation means incorporating feminist practices and 
tools  into  one's  own  life  and  enjoying  the  possibility  of  entering  and  leaving  collective  action 
according to one’s availability of time and desire. 
According to the molecular character of FSs in Madrid, I decided to include a case that is not a space, 
but an itinerant platform that aims to cross all the spaces and all the neighbourhoods of the city, the 
Plataforma Encuentros Bolleros. A PEB interviewee explains it as such: 
It is an itinerant space, it doesn't have a place where we always go... Well, that was precisely one 
of the points that was decided on purpose, that there shouldn't be a place where we would always 
meet to avoid a centralisation of activism. [...] So that's why it was decided we could also be in 
Ecoo, in Carabanchel, in Vallecas, in Arganzuela, in Tetuán [neighbourhoods of Madrid], to move 
around the different spaces. Is it true that the city of Madrid is still safe? What about the dykes 
who live in towns that are an hour away from Madrid? (IIIM2, PEB, 30) 
 
The choice of mobility goes in the direction of allowing women and lesbians to participate regardless 
of their location in the city, their political background, and their possibility to come to know about 
the existence of this group. In response to the proliferation of feminist sensibilities, FSs are not 
necessarily tied to one place, but more open and flexible to include potential participants. 
The dark side of proliferation of feminist political participation is the false idea of the achievement 
of gender equality. This idea gives the floor to right-wing and extremist discourses, as the last election 
of the new City Council of Madrid on 4 May 2021 shows – with Isabel Díaz Ayuso of the Partido 
Popular in alliances with the extreme right of Vox. The negative consequence is the narrowing down 
of resources and provisions by institutions, and it is part of the same process of proliferation.  
 
Mobilising Affects 
Women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people get to participate in FSs because they search for a 
space to change something about themselves, and then about the outside world (McAdam 1989). 
Participants  say  that  the  first  feeling  in  a  FS  is  to  "stop  feeling  crazy"  (IIM3,  EK,  54).  The 
development of one’s self as subject takes place on an individual, social, and political level. These 
three dimensions are often separated and do not allow the elaboration of the self, and neither do they 
entertain the capacity to change contexts considered unjust or to make one's voice heard with regard 
to those in power. The male-shaped world stigmatises women for their emotions and reactions when 
they face situations of violence or harassment. Under the accusation of hysteria, many women have 
had their needs, feelings and expectations of life disavowed (Showalter 1993). The reversion of the 

263 
 
stigma is part of a process of political subjectivation which takes place in FSs. FSs become places in 
which  to  recompose  subjectivity  on an  individual,  social,  and  political  level,  developing  self-
awareness,  collective  consciousness,  and  tools  for  intervention  in  the  public  sphere.  In  FSs, 
participants access change on several levels. In their private life, changes regard sexual and emotional 
relationships, career choices, geography. Women “learn to think” and to reflect on themselves, to 
critically investigate their emotions, and to reconcile them in a framework of social inequality. As an 
interviewee of the PEB accounts, these are “reflective space[s], which also [help] you think in a space 
of shared thought” (IIIM4, PEB, 54). The most important achievement is the awareness that these 
changes  collectively  occur  with  the  complicity  of  other  comrades.  As  a  EK  interviewee  argues, 
through the discussion with the other individuals, feelings become the ground for rethinking social 
structures and the gender regime: “we become empowered when we do group work, you become 
empowered because you realise that you are not a crazy person and that it is a feeling in every country, 
in  every  region”  (IIM3,  EK,  54).  The  creation  of  communities  is  a  source  of  empowerment  for 
invisible and marginalised groups (Osaghae et al. 2010). Creating alternative structures of feelings 
where participants elaborate on their emotional display results from “the generation of community 
[...]. That of a community as invisible as ours” (IIIM4, PEB, 54).  
All the cases included in the research, as for the Italian cases, opt for political separatism. Separation 
is not based on biology (none of them is a trans-exclusionary space), but on positionality: as women 
in the case of EDIs; as feminists in the case of EK; as feminists, lesbians, and bisexual people in the 
case of PEB. As an interviewee claims, the absence of cis heterosexual men changes the setting and 
the opportunity to create structures of feelings:  
And one thing that happens here [...] is that women feel comfortable and safe. They all say that 
because men don't come in [...]. Most of the women who come here have experienced some kind 
of violence, discomfort, or complex situation. [...] All of them have experienced situations of 
violence [...]. And in which [...] there have always been men. [...] When there is a man [...] it 
changes. It changes the way we relate to each other. [...] When you take men out of the equation, 
the body relaxes and a confidence and another type of relationship appears. Our empowerment 
activities are for women only. (IM3, EDI, 37) 
 
The quote shows that the opportunity for cognitive and bodily liberation depends on the composition. 
The perception of spaces, the way affects circulate, and the work on them is influenced by intensities 
and energies coming from bodily presences. The presence of men is perceived as a trigger of negative 
affects, such as insecurity, fear, discomfort, competitiveness. On the contrary, when the bodies and 
subjectivities  are  not  cis-males,  participants  can  experience  different  affects  that  emerge  in  the 
relationship with the space, with the objects, with other participants.  
In  analysing  the  structures  of  feelings  generated  by  FSs,  the  importance  of  self-defence  groups 
emerged. While in Italy several groups of feminist-defence exist, although in an almost hidden way, 

264 
 
in Spain hundreds of feminist self-defence groups have spread in a visible way. Two of the cases 
under investigation include self-defence groups, and all the interviewees have referred to self-defence 
groups. As an EK interviewee argues, “For me the self-defence group is very much something that if 
something happens in your life that makes you feel vulnerable, you can come and feel that you have 
a very strong network” (IIM2, EK, 37). These groups hold different functions. They are training 
groups  for  women,  lesbians,  trans,  and  non-binary  people’s physical  empowerment,  as  the  self-
defense groups of the suffrages movement (Garrud 1910). They are groups of self-consciousness 
rising  and  mutualism.  They  are  verbal  self-defence  and  psychology  gyms.  They  are  groups  for 
practical support and help in situations of trouble or violence. As an interviewee mentions, the group 
helped her when she had troubles with a bad flatmate: “I was very angry. I remember talking to my 
defence group and they said: this is what we are here for, let's go and scare him. So we went to the 
bar where he works, my friends and I. And we said, well now you pay Susi the money you owe her 
or else we'll make a fuss here in your bar. And he'll pay me. So, I don't know, it's an example. For me 
it was very concrete” (IIM2, EK, 37). As the following example shows, self-defence groups are also 
interplaying with anti-violence services and they fulfil some practical women’s needs: “there is a girl 
who needs to go and get her things at home because her ex has assaulted her and she is afraid to go 
and get her things. Who can go with her to help get her things then? Well, there are several of us to 
go with her” (IIM2, EK, 37). Self-defence groups in Madrid have a formal network and they share 
information, chats, and practices. The night before 8 March, self-defence groups usually do a march 
at night, which is not authorised by the city council, and it express the grassroot work of the feminist 
movements  in  Madrid  over  physical  and  mental  strength,  women’s  empowerment  and  self-
determination. FSs generate new structures of feelings. In Spain, the practice of self-defence adds a 
bodily element to the cognitive element of working on affects. The work on the body, on emotions, 
and reactions allows participants to develop their sense of self, their bodily, cognitive, and emotional 
capacities, and in this sense their agency.  
 
Vulnerability, Care and Alliances  
In the previous section, I looked at the way affects are mobilised at the micro level of political 
participation. The work on affects allows to locate the individual experience in the broader social 
structure of inequality. By questioning affects, participants learn tools to transform them. Which 
affects, emotions and feelings are at stake? How are these affects made into politics?  
The interviewees in Spain frequently mention vulnerability, care, and interdependency. With regard 
to the Italian cases, I went through the notion of care and feminist reappropriation of a social function 
which used to be demanded from women. The creation of caring spaces allows to preserve the work 

265 
 
on  affects  that  takes  place  in  FSs.  The  work  on  affects  results  in  structures  of  feelings  where 
participants develop their political elaboration, strategic thinking, and collective action. Affects flow 
within relational ties. In order to preserve this process, participants have to take care of each other.  
Here I would like to focus on care and vulnerability as a point of access to get the Spanish FSs’ 
strategies  on  alliances  and  the  meaning  they  attach  to  this  process.  Care  is  a  relational  process 
mediated  by  reciprocal  attention,  understanding,  and  assumption  of  responsibility.  In  FSs, 
participants feel the opportunity to express vulnerability – physical, emotional, work-related, etc. – 
and make it an object of analysis. Vulnerability becomes an opportunity for healing, and creates the 
conditions for affective ties and alliances. The stress on vulnerability is emerging more than the 
literature explored so far, and it discloses promising venues for enriching the concept of feminist 
alliances. 
The three cases under investigation show great differences in terms of composition. These spaces 
host several smaller communities within: groups on gender and sexuality (such as lesbian, trans, 
bisexual, non-binary people), physical and mental disabilities (such as Foro de Vida Independiente 
or Orgullo Loco), labour and exploitation (such as Territorio Domestico and Precarias a la Deriva), 
other economies and conscious consumption (such as solidarity purchasing groups). In these spaces, 
alliances occur between groups made up of people claiming social and emotional assistance (such as 
people with disabilities) with people who physically carry out that work and are often exploited 
because of it (domestic workers). An interviewee of the EK explains the role of vulnerability as an 
affective ground where ties can be established, despite differences: “this alliance does not arise from 
the  precariousness  of  migration,  of  care  chains,  of  diversity,  but  from  our  own  vulnerability  in 
understanding diversity. How adaptable am I? How secure am I in the face of this system that makes 
me vulnerable and in the face of my own vulnerability?” (IIM5, EK, 54). By exploring the roots of 
inequalities, participants elaborate on vulnerability as a result of a system of social and economic 
inequalities. Vulnerability is not an individual account, but rather a common affect across social 
divisions, and participants elaborate political ties and strategic goals based on the acknowledgment 
of the experience of vulnerability. Although there are different ways in which society makes us 
vulnerable, it is possible to build tools to transform vulnerability from a bodily, social, and economic 
disadvantage into a tool for resistance. Vulnerability is made into a bridge between different social 
conditions which can gather in common paths. Since all of the people involved perceive themselves 
as (also) vulnerable, they all need the others. All of them stress the importance of interdependency, 
because of this acknowledgment of the consequences of social inequalities on bodies and minds. As 
an interviewee argues, care is not only a gendered function related to women, but it can be made into 
a tool for ties and strategic thinking: “we put care at the centre, which I think is something a little 

266 
 
different from how this notion of care is understood. [...] Here “life” is at the centre, care is produced 
from  that  intersection.  You  always  see  vulnerability,  dependence,  precariousness,  and  common 
struggles” (IIM5, EK, 54).  
This concept of vulnerability is strictly connected to the one of the social margin. A PEB interviewee 
elaborates on the notion of margin as a space of dissidence and of overturning of social norms: “I 
really believe that it is open to dissidence, to living from the margins in general” (IIIM2, PEB, 30). 
In her work on gender, race, and class differences, the Black feminist scholar bell hooks develops the 
notion of margin, as a place of radical openness and possibility inhabited by those people who are not 
included in the masculine, white, able, heterosexual, hegemonic centre of society. That space is a 
social location that comes with exclusion, exploitation, and invisibility. However, it is also a place of 
radical critique and resistance, where a new meaning of politics can be elaborated against and beyond 
the centre.  The  margins  are  places  of  dissent  where  new  identities  are  built  upon  and  put  into 
correlation. From a polycentric margin, FSs enhance their idea of alliances that are not oriented to 
the centre, but rather transform the (social location of the) margin into a tool for social change. 
Alliances, in FSs, arise out of the work on affects such as vulnerability, care, and interdependency, 
and  they  are  oriented  to  strategic  goals  which  heavily  rely  on  a  critical  understanding  of  social 
inequalities. In their special issue on feminist alliances, Ciccia, della Porta and Pavan (2021) shed 
light  on  the  capacity  of  feminist  movements  to  build  alliances  across  social  divisions,  by  re-
politicising the field of inequalities from below. Moreover, they argue about intersectional solidarity 
as  a  way  to  overcome  an  exclusionary  understanding  of  sisterhood  and a  concept  which 
“constitutively integrates concerns for other social inequalities, interrogates its own privilege and 
biases and acknowledges as its own struggles for women’s rights that take place under a different 
name” (2021: 1). The cases under investigation broaden the scope of our understanding of alliances 
by  accounting  for  the  role  of  affects  and  emotions  in  the  creation  of  political  ties  across  social 
divisions.  
 
9.4 Feminist Spaces by Means of Affects Between Italy and Spain: A Summary  
 
In  this chapter,  I  went  through  the  comparative  analysis  of  Italian  and  Spanish  FSs  by  drawing 
attention to some features. On one hand, I compared the historical path of the feminist movements in 
Italy and Spain: because of their different story – which in Spain has been marked by Franco’s regime 
and the autonomous and institutional development of feminists groups and activists – they display 
different types of FSs, but through a work on affects similar to the cases in Italy. In order to understand 
this work on emotions, I looked at three dimensions: the macro, meso and micro level. I analysed 

267 
 
how FSs develop agency by means of affects, with respect to the structure of the health and economic 
crisis,  and  to  a  series  of  actors:  local  and  national  institutions,  the  urban  context,  the  feminist 
movement.  At  the  meso  level,  I  followed  the  process  of  becoming  safer  through  the  conscious 
elaboration  on  collective  affects,  which  also  impacts  on  the  decision-making  process  and 
organisation. By producing alternative structures of feelings, FSs disentangle the notion of the private 
home, by creating public, collective, and mutualistic homes. I looked at the work on vulnerability as 
a tool to establish alliances, in the framework of interdependency and care. At the micro level, I 
looked at the proliferation of feminist political participation, that extends the scope of efficacy of 
safer spaces beyond the four walls of physical spaces. 
The analysis shows evidence of the consequences of the work on affects done by FSs. FSs profuse 
efforts in grasping, naming, and elaborating affects. Despite the minority status to which affects are 
normally relegated in the neoliberal setting and often in politics, FSs elaborate on affects as the matter 
on which to build discourse, action, and conflict. This is evident more than ever in the outbreak of 
the pandemic which is still ongoing.  
Italy and Spain show a similar display of the economic model and its related cultural and social 
meanings. The political order conditioned a different development of parties and movements, with 
reference  to  Franco's  authoritarian  regime  and  the  transition  to  democracy,  so  that  elements  of 
ambivalence  remain:  on  the  one  hand,  a  strong  progressivism,  on  the  other  hand,  pockets  of 
preservation of the memory and legacies of the regime. It was interesting to note how the unveiling 
of the emotional dimension is part of a more general legacy of the feminist movement. This element 
that emerges from the cross-national comparison leads us to infer that the work on affections is, on 
the one hand, a specificity developed by feminist movements, and on the other hand the instrument 
of challenge to the capitalist economic model. As explored in previous chapters, emotions are socially 
produced, and therefore change according to context and reference codes. What emerges, however, 
is not an examination of the type of emotions, but rather of the mechanism of emotion processing. 
This mechanism helps to combine the individual dimension with the social dimension, and to develop 
repertoires of action consistent with the structure of the feelings in which they are developed.  
The finding that emerges from the cross-national analysis is even more interesting with regard to 
phases. Both countries have experienced the heavy consequences of the economic crisis in the last 
decade. Since 2020, they have experienced the explosion of the pandemic crisis. Conducting the camp 
during the pandemic provided an opportunity for the in-the-making analysis of a historical moment 
strongly  marked  by  collective  affections.  The  pervasive  element  of  mourning,  grief,  and  loss 
constituted the structure of meaning in which the FSs included in the research in Spain related to. 
This strongly suffering emotional structure represented the terrain on which the FSs deployed their 

268 
 
expertise in affective work: in this way, even very invalidating feelings, such as mourning, were 
transformed into individual and collective tools for increasing agency. This mechanism sheds light 
on the link between affect and FSs. Affections, in fact, according to Spinoza's elaboration, represent 
the vital tension of the bodies, their affirmation of life. The taking charge of affects and the work of 
awareness allow FSs to work on that potential for action rooted in affects, and that is therefore 
nourished by them. The investigation of power and agency through the lens of affects thus allows 
new insights into the relationship with the structure, with the construction of collective action, with 
individual paths. Also, and above all, from the point of view of a cross-national comparison.

10. The Potential of Affect: Concluding Remarks  
 
 
10.1 Introduction 
 
On 25 August 2021, the Lazio regional government, which includes the city of Rome, auctioned off 
the building of the House of Women Lucha Y Siesta. The building was owned by ATAC, the public 
transport company of Rome, which was at risk of bankruptcy. Thus, ATAC had auctioned off from 
2019 a number of properties in its possession, including that of Lucha Y Siesta, to recover resources 
with which to pay off the debt to creditors. In September of the same year a committee called Lucha 
alla Città  (Lucha  to  the  city) was created  in  support  of  the  building,  through  which  the  FS  had 
established and expanded relationships with the neighbourhood, with people in solidarity, with some 
institutional  representatives,  including  councillors  of  the  regional  government.  Thanks  to  these 
relationships, in December 2020 the Region allocated with a resolution one and a half million euros,
21
 
intended for the attempted purchase at auction, then formalised it in August 2021. After the purchase, 
Regional President Nicola Zingaretti commented: "We saved Lucha y Siesta, a great experience of 
women's  protagonism  and  fight  against  gendered  violence.  A  heritage  of  all  of  Rome  and  our 
community. We did it [...] because it is hypocritical to fill our mouths with the words ‘rights’ and 
‘solidarity’ and then watch without doing anything to the closure of services."
22
 In the process of 
negotiating  with  the  Region,  the  Lucha  alla Città  committee  conducted  a  participatory  design 
workshop, which later resulted in a statement of self-governance. 
Shortly thereafter, in September 2021, the International House of Women of Rome obtained the free 
loan  for twelve years  thanks  to  the  rule  "Urgent  measures  for  the  protection  of  the  Association 
Consortium International House of Women of Rome and Budget Law,”
23
 approved by the Parliament. 
This ruling closed a long dispute with the City Council of Rome, led by the Mayor of the 5 Star 
Movement Virginia Raggi, who had defined them as "tenants in arrears" because of a debt of 800,000 
euros due to the non-payment of part of the rent accumulated from 2001.  
Moreover, Michela Cicculli, participant of Lucha Y Siesta, became Councillor for Gender, Youth, 
Budget and Memory Policies in the VIII Municipality, and in October 2021 she was elected to the 
City Council with Sinistra Civica Ecologista, in support of the Mayor Roberto Gualtieri. Along with 
the position, she became president of the Equal Opportunities Commission.

These developments occurred over a year after the end of this research's fieldwork and are therefore 
purposefully not included in the analysis. Yet, coming to the conclusion of this journey, they represent 
an important suggestion regarding the topic of the manuscript.  
It is appropriate to consider these passages as political outcomes of the collective action of feminist 
spaces. What do they add to our understanding of the work on affect? How do they fit, affect and 
emotions, into successful experiences of collective action? What do they suggest, more generally, to 
our understanding of social movements? 
In the following chapter, I will try to articulate some final conclusions. I will try to add a piece which, 
also given the latest developments of the cases, tries to go one step further and sideways from the 
findings. For this purpose, the chapter explores (10.1) the potential academic achievements of this 
research project, then (10.2) the methodological contribution. The last section will account for limits 
and future research opportunities (1.3). Finally, the manuscript ends with an epilogue that will try to 
claim for the relevance of this project for the public debate on affect and emotions, democracy, 
gender-based violence, and political participation (10.4).  
 
10.2 Eventful Affect 
 
We are usually very poorly equipped to deal with emotions, in our existence and in empirical analysis. 
The case of feminist spaces suggests some substantial contributions to our understanding of collective 
action,  of  the  relationship  between  agency  and  structure,  and  of  the  biographical  trajectories  of 
participants.  
In the following section, I will try to enucleate the main theoretical contributions that have emerged 
from the participatory research, looking specifically at the intersections between social movement 
studies, feminist theory, and affect theory. The section aims to present in a schematic way the main 
takeovers for the reader at the end of this ethnographic journey. I will try to relate the findings to a 
series of units of analysis of the three literatures, building on, and/or proposing, oblique perspectives.  
 
● A sociological understanding of affect in social movement studies 
 
Apart from a few examples (see Gould 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010), studies on social movements have 
so  far  been  little  influenced  by  the affective turn.  The  concern  has  always  been  with  emotions. 
Emotions have been a cause for concern for theories of collective behaviour (Smelser 1962, Gurr 
1970); an element of temporary oblivion for resource mobilisation theory and political opportunity 
structure  (Tarrow  1994);  core  features  in  the  in  the  study  of  social  movements  (Aminzade  and 

271 
 
McAdam 2001, Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta 2001, Whittier 2001, 2009), albeit sometimes through 
the reiteration of an instrumental, and therefore rational, interpretation. 
Yet, this research tries to claim something different. By building on della Porta and Giugni’s (2013) 
invitation to deepen our understanding of emotional labour within social movements (Whittier 2001), 
the  role  of  friendships  ties,  and  the  atmosphere  produced  in  the  day-by-day  interactions,  the 
manuscript tries to detail some dynamics of the shadowy substance of affect and emotions.  
First, the literature on social movements has often looked at emotions, but rarely at affect. Affect 
signals the vital impulse, the intensity, and strength of the encounter of a body with another body, 
with an object, with a space. Affect, as Gould (2009) suggests, is a non-linguistic, non-rational, and 
undefined impulse. It represents the vital expression of a body, but above all the relational aspect. We 
are always in relationship – with other bodies, with objects, with spaces – and this relationship is 
signalled by an intensity, which is an ongoing source of information. Affect provides information 
about  our  surroundings,  but also  about  our  bodily,  social,  and  cultural  location.  This  source  of 
information may remain unexpressed, and therefore “silent,” or it may be translated into words, and 
therefore made available for action. When put into words, it takes the form of emotions and feelings.  
Emotions, once given a name, a meaning, become codified objects – with a relative degree of opacity, 
which is never quite resolvable. These emotional codes have an adaptive function, they allow us to 
orient ourselves in the world, and once understood, they allow us to experience an emotion to its 
fullest and with awareness, but also to make a certain conscious use of it. The disclosure of the 
affective, and then emotional, sphere is a dynamic rarely taken into account in the study of social 
movements. Reluctant approaches tend to look at emotions as a field of interest for psychology or 
biology. As della Porta and Giugni point out, “Beyond theoretical concerns, there are also empirical 
difficulties inherent in investigating an impalpable dimension such as emotions, especially when 
researchers  are  sociologists  or  political  scientists,  rather  than  psychologists”  (2013:  124).  The 
sociology  of  emotions  has  long  worked  at  providing  an  understanding  of  the  social  nature  of 
emotions.  A  sociological  approach  to  affect  and  emotion  has  rarely  been  incorporated  into  the 
analysis of social movements. As this project argues, for more than one reason.  
Denying  the  emotional  dimension  is  as  much  a  feature  of  literature  as  of  social  movements 
themselves.  Although  elements  such  as  political  passion,  belief  in  an  idea,  solidarity,  or  an 
instrumental use of emotions in political communication (as in the case of climate activism) can be 
found, a conscious, systematic, and political approach to the affective and emotional dimension is 
much  rarer.  Emotions  are  still  too  often,  even  in  social  movements,  considered  a  matter  for 
psychology, an element of disorder to the detriment of political strategy and effectiveness, a cause of 
slowing down. This normative position is not a fault of the movements, but a reflection of a long 

272 
 
history of ideas which, since the birth of capitalism, has separated the sphere of politics, economics, 
and the rational subject from that of the passions (Hirschman 1977). As della Porta and Giugni stress, 
movements engage with emotional labour (Whittier 2001), with transforming certain bad emotions 
into positive ones (Whittier 2001, Gould 2004), or in transforming the everyday relations to which 
previous emotions were attached (Calhoun 2001: 55). However, emotions are assumed to be only 
strategic, or related to affective ties or solidarity. Rarely, affect and emotions are recomposed into an 
organic understanding, that takes into account both cognition and body, rational and nonrational boost 
to action.  
On the contrary, the recent history of the feminist movement brought back emotions at the centre of 
collective action (Whittier 2001). The regime of social, political, and economic subordination to 
which women have historically been relegated is in fact based on the association between the female 
nature and the sphere of the emotions, the private, the irrational. Feminist movements worked on the 
intuition  that  by  strategically  leveraging  that  dimension,  which  was  also  the  dimension  of  their 
subalternity, it was possible to unhinge the history of ideas and therefore the male paradigm at the 
basis of social structures.  
Through the strategic reversion of the personal as political, feminist movements have developed a 
competence of analysis with respect to affect, emotions, feelings. This competence is at the heart of 
the manuscript and aims at suggesting some perspectives beyond the case studies. The work on affect 
carried out in feminist spaces brings us to think about how and why other social movements have not 
invested in this kind of work. Feminist theory on emotions makes a substantial contribution to studies 
of social movements. In addition, it invites to look at the dark sides of democracy, which lie behind 
and to the side of the rational conception of political action.  
The  sociological  understanding  of  affects  and  emotions,  in  conclusion,  allows  to  recompose  the 
understanding  of  social  movements.  The  understanding  of  that  impulse  opens  up  promising 
trajectories to broaden our view, which so far seems to have missed a piece.  
In this sense, I refer, on the one hand, to eventful affect in order to focus on collective action as 
motion, orientation, capacity for action. On the other hand, to the way in which affect and emotions 
influence not only our idea of democracy, but also what we can see of how democracy takes shape, 
is nurtured. 
 
● Affect as mediation and compass  
 
The  first  theoretical  contribution  concerns  the  sociological  understanding  of  affect  in  social 
movement  studies.  In  addition,  this  project attempts  to  deepen  our  understanding  of  affect  as  a 

273 
 
mediation and compass. We are used to thinking of context (political process theory) and culture 
(constructivism) as separate and non-communicating elements. The concept of affect allows to shed 
light on the connective tissue, on the intensities that move between agency and structure, between 
activists and other actors.  
Feminist theory develops the meaning of the personal as political and contributes to the literature on 
social movements. The choice of developing the political from the personal means, on the one hand, 
understanding the connections, the mediations that link our personal experience to social structures. 
On  the  other  hand,  it  means  understanding  that  those  connections  are  the  repository  of  many 
meanings, both with respect to social (and cultural, economic, political) structures and to the self. 
Feeling a non-rational, non-linguistic, non-cognitive affect signals a certain disposition. For example, 
a woman walking alone in the street at night, upon hearing a noise, might feel an impulse, as yet 
undefined, that puts her on the alert. That impulse is the deposit of a series of meanings: for example, 
it  may  have  happened  to  her  that  in  the  past  a  noise  at  night  was  matched  by  an  unpleasant  or 
dangerous consequence. Or, because everyone – from her family, to the news, to her friends – repeats 
that the night is dangerous for women, and therefore she associates the noise with a socially produced 
sensation attached to that space. Whatever the reason, that sensation puts the woman in relation to a 
context, a space, a structure of meaning. It allows her to mediate what she feels with her body into a 
cognitive idea, a choice, an awareness. These sensations are the means to understand the world around 
her, to understand herself, and to ground her action, or transform it. The more the sensation passes 
from a nonconscious level to a defined and recognisable one (and therefore to a codified emotion), 
the more the function of orientation consolidates. Yet another situation, retrieved from the fieldwork 
in Lucha Y Siesta and reported in Chapter 7, sheds light on this dynamic at a collective level. During 
an assembly between the participants of the collective and the women guests at Lucha, a discussion 
took place about the situation of imminent eviction. The participants tried to explain that, despite the 
fear  and  uncertainty,  the  only  way  to  cope  with  the  situation  was  to  react,  to  participate  in 
demonstrations, to make their voices heard. Women were scared, suspicious, felt angry and basically 
powerless, and tended to only plan for the possibility of leaving the space. At one point a Russian 
woman intervened, saying that she had participated in many demonstrations in her life but had never 
felt like she did in Lucha and during feminist demonstrations. Those feelings had supported her in a 
difficult moment of life, had made her grow and change, had allowed her to acquire tools to feel better 
and face life, as well as to change the mechanisms that trap one in a situation of violence. Through 
the narration of her sensations, she reported a certain disposition of the body, translated into cognition. 
The mediation of affects allowed her to engage with the situation of crisis, the fear in the assembly, 
the projection in the future, and the possible actions to be taken. She said that because of those feelings 

274 
 
she would do anything to defend Lucha, and that they all together had to protect the possibility to 
grow and change – by expressing them forcefully through forms of collective action. This speech 
opened up a channel that allowed other women to rethink their own situation with new tools, and then 
to work out forms of action together for the following weeks. In this account, affects open up a 
circularity of thought between people and function as a channel of mediation. As explained in the 
empirical analysis, affect is also a mediation between cognition and body, it allows to reconnect the 
pieces and access an organic and therefore informed understanding of the self.  
As reported earlier, affect is in fact an impulse that puts us in contact with the outside, but it also 
signals the future of a relationship. In this sense we can think of social reality as a network of affects 
constantly at work, an invisible plot that connects, disjoins, and feeds a structure of meanings between 
bodies, objects, and spaces. This theoretical concept provides the analysis of empirical reality through 
a new look. Often it has been a cone of shadow, or a purely instrumental form of expression, in the 
sense of strategic use. Affect, instead, unlocks a source of information the moment we understand it 
as mediation. It fills the relationship with meaning and signals, it is the result of a series of cultural 
and social presuppositions, but somehow it opens the space for displacement. It is not by chance that 
Raymond Williams theorises the structures of feelings in the sense of tools to challenge the hegemony 
of the dominant order thanks to the signal launched by affect. We become aware of the dominant 
order, of how it acts on us, of what subjects we are in relation to the context, of how much this 
relationship is harmonious, or instead goes to our detriment, thanks to affect. This impulse signals 
the injustice of a social structure, makes it visible, and also beckons us to elaborate a shift when this 
order is detrimental. Through the construction of new meanings and ways of feeling, a possibility 
opens up to challenge the dominant order, or at least to show what is taken for granted and therefore 
invisible.  
Affect provides as much mediation as orientation. In this sense, I refer to affect as a compass. In her 
book Queer Phenomenology, Sara Ahmed argues about orientation:  
emotions shape what bodies do in present, or how they are moved by the objects they approach. 
The attribution of feeling toward an object (I feel afraid because you are fearsome) moves the 
subject away from the object, creating distance through the registering of proximity as a threat. 
Emotions involve such affective forms of (re)orientation. It is not just that bodies are moved by 
the orientations they have; rather, the orientations we have toward others shape the contours of 
space by affecting relations of proximity and distance between bodies. (2006: 2-3)  
 
Orientation, thus, concerns the impulses that bind us to other bodies, spaces, objects. In this project, 
I argue about affect as a compass that orients collective action, by making meanings, words, tools, 
available for action. Affects inform people about the starting point and the structure, and they suggest 
an orientation toward, eventually, the better. Among others, they suggest that positive emotions – 
such as love and joy, but also rage – expand the capacity for action, while others – such as resentment, 

275 
 
frustration, unease, competition, distrust – decrease the willingness to engage. They are a compass in 
the sense that they do not normatively impose a path. Rather, they hint at an orientation, suggest a 
path, a certain disposition of emotion and action to turn towards. In this sense, feminist theory and 
affect theory contribute to the understanding of political mobilisation.   
 
● The potential of affect  
 
The manuscript argues in favour of the potential of affect. Feminist spaces, in fact, engage with what 
affect and emotions enable one to do. This potential, in the Spinozian terms of what a body can do, 
in the expression of its vital impulse, is sometimes addressed in studies of social movements, for 
example by della Porta and Giugni (2013) with reference to the global justice movement. They note 
that “good vibes” and a good frame of mind favour harmonious discussion and conflict management. 
Yet, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the potential of affect.  
During the fieldwork, CGTM brought me to enucleate a reflection on potential and power in reference 
to what emotions allow one to do. Once the fieldwork was over, the series of events reported in the 
opening of the chapter testified the achievement of political outcomes by feminist spaces. 
In the context of ambivalent political opportunities – the political crisis and the threat of eviction 
dictated  by  the  municipal  government,  collaboration  by  the  regional  and  national  government – 
feminist spaces developed an effective method of relationship and collective action. The achievement 
of political outcomes depends not only on allies, state structures, and public opinion (Giugni 1998), 
but also on another dynamic. Indeed, the research reports work on affect as a source of interaction 
with the outside world. The public, and therefore political, expression of a series of claims that had 
long been considered the domain of the private sphere –- as in the case of gendered violence – shifted 
the axis of institutional interest and also of the public opinion in the direction of taking charge of 
these issues. The challenge to a series of dichotomies that underlie democracy as well as the economic 
system, like the rational versus the emotional, opens up innovative channels. The mediation of affect 
represents  an  experiment  in  reformulating  the  relationship  between  grassroot  organisations  and 
institutions, between political participation and elites.  
Yet, the concept of the potential of affect is not only related to successes or outcomes. It refers to a 
broader dynamic, one that concerns the development of the individual and collective potential to 
expand the capacity to understand and therefore act in the world. It does not necessarily translate into 
units of analysis detectable by the disciplinary tools available so far, but it is nevertheless active and 
transformative in feminist spaces.  

276 
 
An example of this potential emerged from the Spanish case, in reference to the pandemic phase in 
which the prevailing emotions were those of pain, suffering, fear, and disorientation. These emotions, 
as is rarely the case, concerned a common feeling for the entire population. Feminist spaces in this 
situation of emergency and extremely unfavourable conditions found themselves better equipped to 
react. In fact, they had developed for years a practice of processing affect and emotions and their 
transformation. Thus, in that case, the general feelings of mourning and grief were taken up and 
transformed collectively, improving not only the quality of life, but also the ability to act in a very 
unfavourable historical phase. 
Included in the reflection on the potential of affect is the examination of positive and negative affect. 
The acknowledgment of the role of positive affects allows feminist spaces to move in the direction 
of those affects that expand the self, the feeling of knowing, and being able to do both in public and 
private space. The politicisation of affects, both negative and positive, expands the tools available to 
collective action. 
These considerations of what affect and emotions allow implements the understanding of a number 
of  units  of  analysis.  First,  in  reference  to  movement  agency  and  how  movements  develop  their 
capacity to  act  even  in  situations  of  ambivalent  political  opportunity.  Second,  in  reference  to 
continuity, and thus what factors fuel a movement's development over the long term. Third, to our 
understanding of participatory democracy. Debunking the rational/emotional dichotomy expands our 
understanding of the roots of modern democracies, institutions, and their representative bodies. On 
the other hand, affectively informed collective action proposes models that are certainly not universal 
or generalisable, but that aim at improving the quality of democratic processes, the search for a good 
life, and social justice. 
In conclusion, the potential of affect and emotion should be understood in both positive and negative 
ways. Understanding what affects allow to do does not linearly orient toward the pursuit of positive 
affects,  and  the  increase  of  the  capacity  for  action.  Affect  is  an  opaque,  turbulent, obscure, and 
sometimes dangerous matter. If some feminist spaces taken into consideration between Italy and 
Spain  have  reached  successful  outcomes,  others  have  experienced  phases  in  which  they  were 
seriously compromised by internal dynamics. The opening up of the emotional sphere and its entry 
into the political sphere complicate the matter of collective action, cheating the cards of interpersonal 
dynamics. When the delicate mechanism of the acquisition of collective awareness, of the orientation 
towards positive affects is jammed, negative emotions proliferate. Suspicion, mistrust, resentment, 
disillusionment, anger, judgement, discouragement. These passions proliferate in collective dynamics 
and corrode the quality of political action, interpersonal relations, the formulation of repertoires of 
action and claims.  

277 
 
These conflicts occur when the emotional dimension is on the table. People are therefore exposed, 
vulnerable, and bring into play a part of themselves that is systematically excluded in other areas of 
life (at work, in education, in social relationships). This exposure of the self produces conflicts with 
even more devastating consequences. Conflict, in fact, does not only concern an idea or a theoretical 
perspective, but the depth of the self, one’s emotions, affective ties, life prospects, and emotional 
investment in a collective project. The spiral of negative affects thus becomes increasingly painful, 
tearing, and deep, opening up personal and collective wounds that the participants often named as 
trauma or mourning.  
These considerations are intended to contribute to an understanding of the factors of disengagement 
and the decline of collective action. At the same time, they represent sketchy considerations, not 
definitive, because they refer to a subject that is by nature opaque and difficult to grasp. Conflict 
within  spaces  that  engage  with  emotions  is  therefore a  field  of  research  that  has  yet  to  be  fully 
explored. It remains to be understood why at a certain point the mechanism jams, what factors lead 
to the proliferation of certain affects to the detriment of others that are more positive, what causes 
and what effects this type of conflict produces in collective action.  
 
● Material girls  
 
This project addresses a debate in social movement studies between old and new social movements, 
or materialist and postmaterialist values. Feminist and environmental movements, among others, are 
considered new social movements (Melucci 1980), inspired by postmaterialist values and concerned 
by culture and identity. The unintended consequence of this interpretation was the removal of the 
material dimension from the analysis of these movements. Unlike the workers' movements, which 
had built their collective action around class and the conflict between capital and labour, the new 
social movements seemed to have abandoned the analysis of the economic model in favour of a focus 
on identity, culture, and civil rights. Even gender, as an analytical concept, seemed to be reduced to 
a purely cultural dimension.  
This approach ignores the contribution of feminist theory and materialist feminism, which focus on 
the intertwining of the production of the economic model and the production of the gender regime 
(Dalla Costa and James 1975, Delphy and Leonard 1980, Ingraham 1997, Guillaumin 2002, Federici 
2012). The materialist analysis focuses, on the one hand, on the identification of the links between 
primitive accumulation and the production of gender as a criterion of social organisation. On the other 
hand, it focuses on the unveiling of the work of social reproduction as the other side of the coin of 
production work, but excluded from the receipt of wages. The condition sine qua non of production 

278 
 
is the reproduction of the conditions of production and thus that a system, in order to function, must 
maintain the structures and structural relations that enable it to function (Halberstam 2011). The 
analysis sinks into a historical perspective, with the development of women’s movements through 
the 19
th
 century, within and beyond socialist circles. The call for civil and political rights quite often 
intertwined with an analysis of the material dimensions underlying certain social inequalities. An 
example of this is the debate on abortion, in which the class dimension has been the subject of the 
demand for the right from the outset (Banotti 1971).  
The legacy of materialist feminism influences contemporary feminist spaces. Three points emerged 
in the course of the research, which it is fair to mention in the conclusions as a theoretical contribution 
to  the  debate.  First,  the  material  dimension  of  direct  social  action.  Second,  feminist  spaces  as 
alternative economies and a challenge to the system of production. Third, social value as opposed to 
market value. 
Feminist spaces often aim to fulfil a need to which welfare and institutions do not respond. This need 
concerns spaces, services, and social networks. Direct social action, such as anti-violence centres and 
shelters,  arises  from  an  intersectional  approach  to  social  inequalities.  Very  often,  the  categories 
excluded from services and welfare are those trapped in a crossroads of racialisation, class, age, 
physical  and  mental  health.  Feminist  direct  action  takes  on  board  what  remains  outside  the 
institutional  criteria.  In  this  sense,  the  material  dimension  occupies  a  central  place  both  in  the 
construction of the service and in the ideas and meanings of the framework. The pathways out of 
violence,  in  fact,  are  based  on  the  acquisition  of  awareness  and  emotional  tools,  as  well  as  on 
economic  autonomy,  work,  and  access  to  housing.  Reconstructing  forms  of  subjectivity  outside 
violence is therefore a material path, that brings into play the subversion of gender as a normative 
prescription that assigns women to subordinate roles, underpaid, completely unpaid, dependent on 
their  partner  or  husband.  Economic  autonomy  is  intertwined  with  emotional  awareness  in  the 
construction of an increasingly oriented, centred, and empowered capacity to act. 
Secondly, the spaces challenge the model of production and circulation of goods and money through 
alternative  economies.  Women  are  not  relegated  to  the  work  of  social  reproduction,  but  equally 
contribute to feminist space’s life and its durability. They take on all necessary tasks, from manual to 
intellectual. Moreover, money and profit are not the parameters that guide the life of the spaces. 
Thanks to a reflection on money, forms of self-income, gifts, or gratuitousness are elaborated, which 
make access more feasible regardless of the economic availability. Moreover, spaces do not aim to 
be productive from a capitalist point of view, but to nurture a structure of feelings that improves the 
capacity for collective action and, at the same time, is oriented towards a good life. These experiments 
give rise to alternative models of economies that are not intended to be generalisable or paradigmatic, 

279 
 
but  rather  serve  as  material  instruments  for  improving  living  conditions, and  thereby  producing 
changes in structure. In this sense, they challenge the capitalist economic model by prefiguring the 
activation of behaviours towards the desired world, including the material world.  
Finally, connected to this, what inspires these spaces is the concept of social value, as opposed to 
market value. Institutions, services, as well as individual lives, are evaluated on the parameter of 
productivity, profit, competition, and market value. Individuals are required to be rational subjects 
oriented towards the pursuit of profit maximisation. By challenging the criteria that underlie our 
understanding of the social, feminist spaces elaborate new criterions of strategic representation, which 
is that of social value. In negotiating with institutions and in representing collective action to the 
outside world, they propose the parameter of social value, in the sense of maximising well-being, 
quality of life, self-awareness, and the capacity to act in relation to social structures. This parameter 
is not purely philosophical as much as it is a concrete tool to relate with counterparts. To cite an 
example, Lucha y Siesta's negotiation with the Lazio regional government was also based on the 
claim of social value as opposed to profit. The government considered it worth it to save the fate of 
the women's house because of its social value, without changing the methodology and composition 
of the space as it has been so far.  
The ironic title of this section refers to the scandalous song by Madonna, who claimed in the lyrics 
that girls love diamonds, too. Then as now, it seems important to – scandalously – recall that the 
material  dimension  of  social  life  is  an  integral  part  of  the  reflection  and  practice  of  feminist 
movements.  
 
● Debunking safety: structures of feelings and affective resonance  
 
Whenever we talk about safety, something much deeper lurks beneath the surface.  
The perception of safety normally seems to be linked to the presence or absence of concrete risks. An 
assailant, a violent person, a harasser, someone who makes one feel uncomfortable, an unwelcoming 
place, a place that exposes one to danger. Very often, neoliberal policies have fostered an association 
between the perception of insecurity and racialised people, poor people, sex workers, or in general 
those who are considered to be on the margins. Vice versa, feeling safe seems to depend on the 
absence of these elements of risk. With reference to women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people, 
feeling safe is closely linked to gender, as a social product that exposes a person to certain risks in a 
greater way. Safe spaces seem to be spaces constructed in opposition to and outside of unsafe places, 
and that therefore, in a dichotomous way, subvert what is outside, producing another dimension of 
life inside.  

280 
 
During the research, I soon realised that this dichotomous vision did not respond to reality. The major 
takeaway with regard to the concept of safe space is that there are no settled, defined, stable places in 
which there is a model of safety, a paradigm, as opposed to the insecurity of the outside. When we 
speak of security, it is always a process through which places are made safer, more liveable. It is a 
negotiation, a process made of attempts and mistakes, a new awareness and failures. It is an unfinished 
path that includes all the people who enjoy the space. It is not a finished product, already given, that 
is provided, available to people. In this sense, from a certain point I stopped referring to safe spaces 
and started referring to safer spaces. That is to say safer, but potentially, in the process, and always 
open to modification, revision, failures.  
The second takeaway is that the perception or absence of safety is only the tip of the iceberg, the most 
visible manifestation of a much deeper dynamic involving affect, as a vital impulse; emotions, as 
formulas  codified  by  culture  and  social  interaction;  and  feelings,  as  the  interweaving  and 
sedimentation of emotions. During the fieldwork, it started to become more and more apparent that 
safety was not simply the absence of harassment during an evening of partying, or lack of physical 
aggression. The perception of safety signals a much deeper feeling involving, on the one hand, the 
actors' relationship with themselves, and on the other hand the relationships between people. The 
dimension of affect and emotions, what people can feel, what they can communicate, and what they 
can transform through interaction are the sites of an increased or decreased perception of safety.  
Sociologists  of  emotions,  like  Hochschild  (1979,  1983,  1990),  formulate  the  idea  of  expression 
“rules”  and “emotion  culture”  (Gordon  1989)  to  suggest  the  cultural  and  social  components  of 
emotions  and  their  expression.  “Part  of  socialization  includes  informal  instruction  about  which 
emotions are appropriate to feel and to express, for how long and how intensely, by whom and in 
what contexts. [...] Communities or social groups have ‘emotion cultures,’ understood as both the 
emotions that are prevalent within the group and the set of tacit or explicit rules and norms that 
demarcate ‘how [members of the group] should attend to, codify, appraise, manage, and express 
feelings’ (Hochschild, 1990:124)” (Gould 2004: 162). Culture is a powerful structure that influences 
what we think we should feel, how we should feel, and if and how we should express it. The term 
“emotion culture” does not refer to a monolithic and static structure, but rather to a prevailing system 
of instruction about how to move and feel in the social world. This is a field of adherence, dissonance, 
open contestation. As Gould explains, “every emotional utterance, gesture, or evocation, particularly 
those that are public and that are repeated over time, has the potential to alter a prevailing emotion 
culture”  (2004:  163).  Building  on  Gould's  assumption,  the  research  explores  the  construction  of 
structures of feelings by feminist spaces, which challenge not only the emotion culture but also the 
meanings that produce it. This challenge allows participants to experiment with new ways of feeling, 

281 
 
expressing, circulating, and transforming emotions. Opening up this space of possibility increases the 
perception of a new relationship with the self and with other people. The rules of expression are put 
to the test, and actors can investigate new perspectives of affectivity. Feeling free to try, and at the 
same time listening and feeling other people’s effort of expression, establishes an environment in 
which affect and emotions flow. It involves the capacity to see the others, to perceive their “vibes,” 
to see in their vibes something about yourself, to search for a negotiated temperature among different 
impulses. Challenging a certain neoliberal model, a model of normative relationships, of emotional 
culture, of rules of expression, increases the perception of safety. In the potential for action opened 
up by reflection on what emotions can do lies the possibility for actors to feel better. Safer, therefore, 
with respect to a world that produces insecurity, not so much and not only in material terms, but also 
in emotional terms, in terms of biographical aspirations.  
Becoming safer is therefore an entirely political process that calls into question the challenge to 
economic, social, and cultural codes.  
These considerations have two consequences. On the one hand, the reference to safety in feminist 
spaces signals a profound work on affect; on the other hand, this perception of increased safety is 
open, unfinished, in the making, always exposed to new negotiations, bound to the willingness of the 
actors to continue working together, to the preservation of an emotional atmosphere, to mutual care. 
Safer  spaces  can,  therefore,  also  be  spaces  in  which  actors  feel  very  unsafe,  in  which  one  feels 
questioned, vulnerable, exposed to interdependence, and therefore less barricaded inside the fortress 
of the ideal of a rational, independent, self-made subject. Exposing oneself to the relationship with 
other people by opening the communication channel of affect and emotions can produce as much a 
feeling of greater safety as, conversely, a feeling of total insecurity when, for example, as elaborated 
in  the  previous  section,  negative  affects  and  destructive  consequences  of  conflict  prevail.  If  we 
replace the concept of structures of feelings with that of emotion culture, referring to the internal 
culture of feminist space, Gould observes that “a given ‘emotion culture,’ then, should be understood 
as prevalent but also as unsettled and mutable, open to challenge and revision and thus always at risk” 
(2004: 163). It is no coincidence that the idea of safe spaces stirs up resentment, grievances, mutual 
accusations of not having made a space safe enough or not safe at all, of having failed to meet 
someone's  expectation  of  safety, or  of  having  betrayed  a  series  of  assumptions,  often  unspoken. 
Negative  passions  surrounding  the  concept  of  safe  spaces  mirror  the  dynamics  just  described, 
whereby safety actually alludes to a much deeper process, and that always and in any case remains a 
process  in  the  making,  which  does  not  allow  for  a  stable,  finite,  monolithic,  definitive,  non-
contradictory configuration of safe space.  

282 
 
So, in conclusion, are safe spaces a unit of analysis that is still conceptually useful? What does the 
concept of safe spaces allow us to see, or not? Undoubtedly, the concept of safe space has a historical 
relevance:  it  allowed  women,  lesbians,  trans,  and  non-binary  people  to  unveil  the  violent 
consequences of an economic, social, cultural, and gendered order that exposes some people to high 
material and immaterial situations of risk. Like any concept, in repetition and use it risks losing its 
complexity, taking for granted something that is not, feeding distortions instead of increasing the 
possibility of action. For this reason, trying to debunk safety, unravelling its complexity, helps to 
recompose a more organic, more multifaceted, more contradictory idea of safe spaces. The political 
appropriateness of using the concept, instead, is an internal discussion within feminist movements on 
which this manuscript has neither the ambition nor the will to intervene. 
 
● Exploding spaces through the breaking of the public-private dichotomy  
 
The last takeaway I would like to address concerns the dimension of space. Space has been a central 
dimension of the research. In fact, the ethnography took place in physical places, located in specific 
cities and neighbourhoods, with an address, four walls, and a set of architectural features. The feminist 
spaces included in the research are what Polletta (1999) calls free spaces, that is, spaces taken away 
from the direct control of institutional bodies and the State, in which forms of collective action that 
precede or prepare for mobilisation are elaborated. This definition in the field of social movement 
studies was a starting point, by building on it new developments of the concept. First, feminist spaces 
broaden our understanding of free spaces, offering some outcomes to reflect upon. Second, they shed 
light on contentious politics against gender-based violence by engaging with urban spaces. Third, 
through the creation of structures of feelings, feminist spaces develop prefigurative politics grounded 
in the transformative potential of emotions. Finally, by breaking the dichotomy of private and public 
space, they disclose promising venues to grasp the intersection between affect, emotions, and spaces. 
As Polletta and Kretchmer argue, “we know little about the free spaces that are created by movements. 
Collectivist organizations, cultural festivals, and cooperative institutions are intended to prefigure 
alternative ways of acting and interacting. Do they? What effects do free spaces have on behaviors 
and institutions outside the free space?” (2013: 3). In a sense, this manuscript attempts to argue about 
these  questions  through  the  concept  of  structures  of feelings.  Spaces,  in  fact,  emerged  as 
condensations of vital impulses, gradients of intensity, and concatenations of bodies. In this dense 
affective matter, the collective action tries to find the coordinates, the words, and the tools to unravel 
the skein in the paths of expansion of the capacity to act. This process is configured as an alternative 
way  of  acting  and  interacting,  which  also  innervates  the  relationships  with  behaviours  and 

283 
 
institutions.  This  alternative  way  is  not  only  about  the  preparation of  mobilisations,  or  the 
preservation of symbols, ideas, and networks in anticipation of mobilisations to come. The process 
concerns the everyday, and is oriented to produce effects on the paths of actors, and more generally 
on the context. The spaces are therefore bearers of collective action, beyond being functional or not 
for the mobilisations. They carry out forms of contentious politics, and the political outcomes, as 
explained above, seem to confirm the transformative potential of working on emotions. 
Feminist  spaces  therefore  carry  out  contentious  politics.  The  issue  they  address  is  gender-based 
violence. Against this form of social inequality, feminist movements sometimes develop forms of 
contentious politics in the sense of opening feminist spaces within the city. The city is the setting 
where the understanding of gender-based violence is developed – both in public and especially in the 
private space – and through the conversion of city spaces, violence is tackled. Spaces are often opened 
through occupation, or forms of self-management in opposition or antithesis to institutions. Yet, 
institutions and the State are not the only counterparts. Denouncing gender-based violence means 
identifying as counterpart the social, and economic, cultural, and political structures founded on a 
gender regime that is also a regime of organising violence. The choice to open feminist spaces against 
violence intends to make violence a public and political fact. If most of gender-based violence takes 
place in the domestic spaces, the choice to expose the phenomenon through a collective action in the 
urban space means to call the citizenship for a general taking charge of the phenomenon. It does not 
only concern women victims of violence, professionals, or services, but it is a phenomenon that 
affects everyone, and that requires an understanding and a responsibility shouldered by all to be 
changed. To produce social change, feminist spaces do not put forward a request, but a contentious 
action.  The  self-management  of  spaces  by  feminist  groups  intends,  on  the  one  hand,  to  provide 
concrete solutions to a material problem, and on the other to produce a fracture, a conflict with the 
surrounding urban and institutional environment. 
In doing so, feminist spaces implement forms of prefiguration, that is, they give life to experiments 
of the world as they would like to change it (Boggs 1977, Williams 2016), by building tomorrow 
today (Raekstad and Gradin 2020). This research brought out another element with respect to the 
unity  of  analysis  of  prefigurative  politics.  Prefigurative  politics  also  requires nurturing positive 
affects, and thus the capacity for action. Feminist movements are, in fact, rooted in the rupture of the 
rational/emotional,  body/cognition dichotomies.  This  subversion  is  not  only  theoretical,  but  it 
translates into concrete practices, and in this sense it prefigures an alternative model of actions and 
interactions.  Prefigurative  politics  is  thus  the  construction  of  structures  of  feelings,  the  process 
through which affect is named and put into circulation, the understanding of what affect and emotions 

284 
 
allow to do. Constructing tomorrow today, therefore, means investing in the matter of emotions in 
the face of a social world in total dissonance with this approach to emotions and affect. 
Finally, the research provides an in-depth understanding of the breakdown between private and public 
space. This rupture is at the heart of feminist theory but less so of studies of social movements. The 
reference  to  feminist  spaces  as  homes  by  the  participants  prompted  me  to  explore  this  striking 
association.  Spaces,  which  are  public,  political,  are  also  homes  because  they  allow  emotional 
development. Affects are, therefore, a lens that allows to modify our perception of space, but also to 
socially produce different spaces that put us in different emotional conditions, allowing us to do 
different things. Feminist spaces are neither entirely public nor entirely private, but they are intimate 
as well as political spaces in which there is room for an elaboration of the self and collective action. 
This is also a spatial dimension in the sense that it modifies the relationship with space and modifies 
space itself. In her work, Rachel Scicluna makes a masterful argument about kitchen tables in the 
lesbian movement in the UK, arriving at similar considerations:  
the kitchen stood for, in a metaphorical and practical sense, all that they were fighting for—that 
is, to create a sense of belonging through political activism based on sexuality. This was a rather 
alternative worldview at the time. The communal kitchen in squats and collectives offered the 
right kind of domestic place to fulfil their political agenda. On the one hand, living communally 
challenged the patriarchal oppression, which was read as politically constructing women as ‘self-
perpetuating subordinate persons’ (Green 2002:183). On the other, through the ‘kitchen as place,’ 
these women formed personal bonds and relationships which produced different kinds of persons 
and counter-acted the sense of fragmentation and disconnection that some experienced in their 
homes  and  public  lives.  In  lesbian  squats,  they  formed  alternative  families  bound  through 
friendship and ideology. Additionally, it offered them the space to sit around the kitchen table to 
discuss their political agenda. In this context, the kitchen embodies those ‘interpersonal’ relations 
(Green  2002)  which  they  strongly  fought  to  deconstruct,  reproduce  and  maintain  through  a 
different way of doing things and thinking about them. Hence, the domestic kitchen becomes a 
political, contested and subversive place which needs to be contextualised within the discourses 
or structures of inequality that represent asymmetric gender, sexual, and class relations (amongst 
others)” (Scicluna 2017: 7) 
 
The explosion of space as classically understood by social movement studies, through the breakdown 
of the dichotomy between public and private, allows us to expand our understanding of free spaces, 
contentious politics, and prefiguration. However, it also allows us to look at the social production of 
space through the lens of affect, which has a transformative potential that has yet to be investigated. 
In fact, the research started with an emphasis on urban space, but constructivist grounded theory led 
me to focus more and more on the role of affect. Space is, therefore, a dimension that has provoked 
some important considerations, but these deserve to be explored further and more systematically. 
 
 
10.3 A Methodological Contribution 
 
 

285 
 
These  concluding  remarks  are  also intended  to  testify  to  the  methodological  contribution  of  the 
project. The research was, in fact, a field of experimentation from the methodological point of view. 
It  aimed  at  integrating  participatory  action  research,  constructivist  grounded theory  method,  and 
feminist approaches. For this reason, I report here the main takeaways.  
 
● Bridging ethics, participatory action method, and feminist approaches  
 
Action research has often been combined with feminist approaches to social research. There are 
indeed  many  points  of  connection,  which  lead  people  with  a  feminist  approach  to  involve 
participatory methods in their research, and vice versa. This project confirms the consistency between 
the two approaches. I approached the research design as a researcher, but also from my own feminist 
experience. The questions, the gaze, the style of relationship were impregnated by a cultural, political, 
and ideal perspective. This consistency brings substantial benefits to research and some limitations. 
Feminist approaches to social research stress the importance of self-reflexivity, the social value of 
research, the relationship with the participants, ethics in the management of information, the process 
of developing findings, and the display of findings (Reinharz 1992). In my case, the feminist approach 
essentially made the research possible. The feminist spaces included in the research accepted my 
presence and made bonds of trust possible only thanks to my positioning. In some cases, such as the 
space of the Cagne Sciolte in Rome, this was made explicitly clear. Moreover, the quality of the 
bonds,  and  therefore  of  the  disclosure  of  their  experiences  towards  me,  was  conditioned  by  the 
perception  of  a  common  belonging.  As  the  self-reflexive  quote  retrieved  from  the  fieldnotes 
addresses: “this has changed the state of relations between us a little: the fact that they have seen, and 
not just known in a general way, that I am a feminist activist in a movement of which they are also 
part, and that I hold positions very similar to theirs, I think, has changed their perspective and their 
approach towards me. Sara, in fact, is very affable with me, much more intimate, and tells me right 
away how things are going” (Fieldnotes LYS, 04-06-19). The relaxation of relationships and the 
opening up of spaces of depth in the research relationship is evidenced by episodes like this one, on 
which I reflected in the fieldnotes: “A young Black girl also comes in and greets them affectionately. 
She is one of the women of the House. At that point Mina says: "Meet Giada, she is one of us. From 
now on you will see her here very often." At that point they broke into a big smile and introduced 
themselves warmly, saying they didn't know.  [...] I go home full of joy, I can feel it palpably as I 
drive. Mina's sentence is an important one, which she said without hesitation: “she is Giada, one of 
us.” It makes me think a lot. It took a long time to get into a form of relationship. The first email I 
sent them was at the beginning of March, and now it's mid-June. In that time we have met and talked, 

286 
 
but so far it has been a phase of negotiating access. And yet it's as if they, as a space, have exactly 
that attitude towards people who do research, who either become part of the space or can't do it. It is 
in itself an embodied example of participatory research, in the sense that so far those who have done 
extensive research at Lucha have actually entered into the management and inhabitation of the place, 
never as external users coming to collect data. Even in my case, they agreed to open the space to 
research when I became ‘one of them,’ that is, when they were able to see unequivocally that I was a 
feminist comrade beyond research, and that I had every intention of helping the space in any way I 
could. What happened tonight puts me very much into question, both about my research and in 
general about the way we understand participatory research. It makes me think that participatory 
research is in fact feminist research, or that feminist research is in itself participatory research, and 
on this axis is constituted the channel of entry to the communities and spaces to be studied. There is 
no other way in which I could have entered Lucha than to become part of it. Both in terms of trust 
and activism. It scares me and it excites me. It gives me back the sense of my research. Its true 
meaning” (Fieldnotes LYS, 04-06-19). As I reflect in the notes, this proximity is both a source of 
value for research and a risk. In fact, as close as the participants and I were, we had different roles, 
and so confusing the plans too much risked exposing them in a way that was not entirely conscious, 
and me betraying, at times, a pact of distance necessary for the research. Distance is always necessary 
in order to keep a clear eye on the fieldwork, to agree on boundaries, and also to select the information 
that  will later  be  included  in  the  research.  Distance  is  also  a  form  of  responsibility  towards  the 
participants, in order to protect them.   
In line with the argument brought forward in this manuscript, the intersection of PAR and feminist 
approaches also concerned affect. The understanding, processing, and sharing of affect and emotions 
were for me a mediation with the participants and the fieldwork. My fieldnotes are full of reflections 
filtered through the matter of affect. It allowed me to understand with my body, and to bring into play 
various channels of understanding. As this example retrieved from the fieldnotes, among many others, 
shows: “The atmosphere is very affectionate and intimate, I realise that barriers of mistrust have fallen 
and they are talking to me as if I were their comrade. It is an enveloping sensation and I realise that 
my involvement in Lucha is already of a different kind. I feel that my willingness to participate is not 
so much driven by the goal of research as by a form of feminist solidarity, so I feel I want to help 
them in a moment of great uncertainty and fatigue. We say goodbye with a hug, saying that we will 
see each other again very soon. I leave Lucha with a hint of sorrow, as when you leave a place of 
warmth and return to the tepid world outside” (Fieldnotes LYS, 17-06-19). The mediation of affect, 
like a compass, provided me with important information on how to orient, modify, or revise the 
interaction with the participants and the methodology, but it also gave me the tools to clarify the 

287 
 
theoretical  contributions.  On  a  methodological  level  and  in  cross-fertilisation with  feminist 
approaches,  the  research  proposes  a  reflection  on  affect  as  a  channel  of  mediation  during  the 
fieldwork and in the elaboration of findings. 
 
● PAR as a scale of intensity  
 
The second takeaway of a methodological nature concerns PAR as a scale of intensity. In carrying 
out the fieldwork, I realised that it is not possible to carry out the PAR approach in the same way in 
all the cases included in the research. The research included six cases between Rome and Madrid, 
distinguished by profound differences. First of all, the contexts and conjunctures were different. The 
city  of  Rome  is  in  Italy,  in  my  native  country,  where  I  could  benefit  from  previous  networks, 
knowledge  of  the  language,  and  a  common  socio-cultural  background.  Moreover,  between  the 
fieldwork in Italy and in Spain there was the pandemic, which substantially influenced the level of 
participation in the research. Even among the Italian cases there were profound differences. The PAR 
is  always  the  result  of  a  relationship  between  the  researcher  and  participants.  This  relationship 
fluctuates according to the composition of the spaces, the age, the political culture of reference, and 
the political phase experienced by the spaces. 
Participatory research was not fully possible with the International House of Women in Rome. The 
size of the space, the composition, the age, the availability of the participants did not allow that style 
of research to be effective, neither was it practicable. With them I could not help but be considered a 
young girl, and therefore less credible as a researcher. Moreover, it was not always clear to everyone 
what I was doing there, due to the large size of the space and the varying intensity with which people 
experienced its everyday life. With Lucha Y Siesta, on the other hand, we developed the deepest and 
most systematic application of PAR, which continues to this day. Most of the previous relationships 
existed with the space of the Cagne Sciolte, and this conditioned the choice of methods, for example 
avoiding participant observation, which would have exposed them more than they would have liked. 
PAR as a scale of different intensities has both positive and negative aspects. First, in handling many 
cases it is inevitable not to carry out the same in-depth research reports with all of them. PAR is a 
very time- and energy-consuming methodology, both for the researcher and the participants, and 
requires a number of pre-conditions. In this sense, the scale of different intensities makes PAR and 
research feasible, and allows to grasp what is possible from each case. The very level of involvement 
of each case is useful information in the analysis, because it signals the characteristics, interaction 
styles, and orientations of the cases. On the negative side, this intensity scale represents a limitation 
in that it does not allow access to valuable information from some cases. Boundaries in research, with 

288 
 
a PAR approach, require from the researcher an even firmer ethics. Negotiation can therefore be 
downward for the researcher, precluding the possibility of gathering important information. 
The relationship with spaces varies in intensity. However, PAR involves the posture of the researcher. 
Thus, I always maintained a participatory posture, and in every case this influenced every interaction, 
observation, and consideration during the fieldwork. Just as an example, I noted down the following 
during the fieldwork at the International House of Women, despite the relatively less intense feature 
of  our  research  interaction:  “the  House  becomes  more  and  more  familiar.  As  I  walk  around  the 
building I seem to begin to catch its movement, the rhythm with which it moves, the noises and 
silences.  Today,  I  happened  to  walk  through  the  corridors  and  found  myself  in  front  of  archive 
photographs. The corridors are full of photographs: marches, posters, close-ups. [...] I felt a strong 
and  immediate  principle  of  recognition,  a  red  thread  linking  my  experience  as  a  young  woman, 
researcher, and feminist activist with generations of women and activists who have passed through 
the House and are still living it. This profound emotion represents one of the constitutive features of 
my experience of the House, the recognition of a non-neutral position whose limits I need to name. 
What  speaks  to  me,  what  reconnects  me,  is  a  principle  of  identification  and  disidentification. 
Something of my presence here concerns me as an external subject, as a 'foreign' researcher who 
observes the dynamics and the actresses as a mystery, a tangle to be unravelled. Another part of me 
recognises the deep roots of my presence here, the threads that connect me to this place not only as a 
researcher but also as a woman, an activist, a feminist” (Fieldnotes CID, 23-10-18).  
The variation in intensity also concerns the researcher. In the field, as explained in the previous 
section, the mediation of affect is a compass. It is very frequent to feel loneliness, frustration, fatigue, 
bewilderment, anger, guilt. These feelings direct the involvement of the fieldwork and impose on the 
researcher  the  rhythm,  the  pauses,  the  interruptions.  The  mediation  of  affects  allows  PAR  to  be 
oriented in a sustainable way, which also means with a scale of different intensities. 
 
● Bridging participatory action research and constructivist grounded theory 
 
In recent years, experiments in the intertwining of participatory action research and grounded theory 
were developed (Teram et al. 2005, Redman-MacLaren and Mills 2015, Raekstad and Gradin 2020). 
Both of them should be considered as a group of “family resemblances” (Charmaz and Bryant 2007, 
Bryant 2007) rather than a monolithic approach. This manuscript highlights a number of points of 
convergence  between  the  two  approaches:  research  as  the opening  of  an  inductive  and  iterative 
process in the making; the back-and-forth movement from the fieldwork, interweaving data collection 
with data analysis; the continuous re-orientation of the field simultaneously and depending on the 

289 
 
results emerging from the analysis. In this section, I would like to emphasise above all the elements 
of the participatory approach that influenced the CGTM.  
In  fact,  PAR  requires  the  involvement  of  participants  at  all  stages  of  the  research  process.  As 
suggested  by  the  CGTM,  this  allows  for  starting  without  precise  literature,  but  negotiating  the 
research questions and orientation together. Negotiating the questions was followed by the beginning 
of the field, negotiating time and space, and building trust. Thanks to the process of going back and 
forth  from  the  field,  the  elements  that  emerged  from  data  analysis  could  become  the  object  of 
reflection  in  the  fieldwork,  whether  in  participant  observation,  interviews,  or  focus  groups.  This 
formulation  of  early  findings  from  the beginning  of  the  fieldwork,  prescribed  by  the  CGTM, 
improved the quality and refinement of the collection of items of interest during the fieldwork. In 
fact,  the  participants'  gaze  and  mine  was  increasingly  refined,  more  oriented  toward  the  most 
significant  elements,  leaving  aside  the  things  that  were instead progressively  moving  into  the 
background. Slight changes in questions during interviews, in the way I took fieldnotes, occurred in 
the process. The more the code system grew and was defined, the more the field would change as 
well. 
From the first contacts I also found myself having to explain what CGTM was. The access to feminist 
spaces in fact, especially in cases where the PAR was more intense, required several initial moments 
that took the form of email exchanges, discussions in two, or assembly discussions. In the case of the 
space of the Cagne Sciolte, the possibility of the research was discussed in an assembly form with all 
the  participants.  CGTM  is  a  complex  research  method  that  requires  specific training  and  the 
acquisition  of  a  range  of  both  theoretical  and  practical  skills  for  the  researcher.  Explaining  the 
methodology was thus a challenge. This effort, however, made it possible to make the instrument 
accessible, and therefore to shorten the distance between the technical part of the research work and 
the participation through which the research came to life. Only in the case of the Cagne Sciolte, they 
formulated the desire to participate in the analysis of the data. The request was formalised in two 
moments of shared data analysis, carried out on the Jitsi Meet platform, sharing a Riseup pad (all 
non-proprietary and open source platforms that did not involve excessive risk), in which I had inserted 
anonymised  excerpts  of  the  interviews.  These  moments  represented  the  height  of  convergence 
between the two methodological approaches. It allowed me to test the scheme of codes developed up 
to that point, materially working out with the participants the understandings, meanings, and concepts 
that explained their words. For them, it allowed a moment of self-reflexivity, of listening to each 
other, and increasing understanding about the processes of collective action, which sometimes in the 
flow of political action is not available.  

290 
 
Reflections  from  this research  experience  are  intended  to  contribute  to  the  development  and 
application  of  these  methodologies.  On  the  one  hand,  it  is  important  to  combine  PAR  with  a 
systematic, reliable, rigorous, organic, verifiable approach to analysing empirical material. In fact, 
data analysis is a rigorous step of inquiry, requiring an inductive but codified process, whose steps 
can negotiate – certainly not make disappear – the subjectivity of the researcher and their filter, with 
the production of a theoretical framework anchored to the material dimension. It is not a matter of 
bringing out the truth, but of elaborating in an ethical, systematic, and rigorous form the portion of 
empirical reality studied. The empirical reality, its complexity, deserve in fact the maximum of ethics 
and rigour on the part of the researcher, even and especially because of the non-neutrality of research.  
On the other hand, it is worth combining CGTM with an approach that holds action and participation 
together. At some level, CGTM includes a form of negotiation with participants. Indeed, the cyclical 
process of analysis forces the researcher to continually go back and forth, where in fact the sifting of 
research  materials  occurs  through  the  relationship  with  participants.  PAR  makes  it  possible  to 
formalise this participatory aspect by providing a systematic, rigorous and demonstrable codification 
of the participatory process.  
Social research in general, and qualitative research in particular, involve relating to human beings, 
and therefore a margin of flexibility and unexpectedness given by the relationship. Yet, trying to 
codify this research relationship roots the process, provides for steps, an orientation. It allows for the 
formalisation of ethical assumptions and a commitment to mutual responsibility. In this, the analysis 
of data does not remain a solitary activity of the researcher, who negotiates only with herself the 
doubts, errors, and successes, but opens up to a collaborative journey in which the findings result 
from the multiplicity of perspectives of the people involved. After all, what are findings? They are 
conceptual tools, heuristic devices that allow to approximate the understanding of a given social 
phenomenon. In the case of these approaches, this understanding cannot be separated from those who 
live  the  phenomenon,  and  therefore  have  an  embodied  experience  of  it,  in  conjunction  with  the 
expertise of the researcher, who therefore has academic knowledge of it. Findings, however, are not 
only concepts of understanding, but also tools that, through understanding, can produce change. This 
is discussed in the next and final section of methodological takeaways. 
 
● Dissemination of results  
 
PAR, as a methodological approach, prescribes a participatory relationship from the formulation of 
the research design to the dissemination of results. What is meant by dissemination? It means a 
formulation  and  dissemination  of  research  findings  through  tools  and  channels  that  produce 

291 
 
transformative or social change-oriented consequences for the participants as well as the academic 
context. It is one of the strongest elements of the empirical translation of academic knowledge, and a 
point  of  convergence  between  the  production  of  knowledge  carried  out  by  social  movements 
themselves and that produced by academic research. 
From the beginning, with all of the spaces, there was an explicit request from the participants to also 
use the results for feminist spaces purposes. With them, we collected a series of experiments, some 
already carried out and some reserved for the future.  
Before beginning with the overview, a clarification is needed. Reflection on dissemination allows 
PAR to be highlighted as an open-ended process that has a beginning point but hardly a formal end 
point. Just as the fieldwork did not formally end but one part of the research relationship did, over 
time the relationships with the participants developed and transformed, and persist to this day.  
First,  I  made  myself  available  for  any  requests  from  participants.  This  meant  sometimes  just 
accompanying them to events, in other cases direct participation in events organised by them, such 
as book presentations, discussions on topics, organising workshops, writing projects. In all of these 
venues, my participation has been through sharing direct or indirect outputs of participatory research. 
The form of collaboration in the activities they proposed allowed the outputs to become a ground for 
concrete use, writing, reflection, further design. In some cases, part of the results flowed, for example, 
in the participatory design workshops of Lucha Y Siesta, towards the writing of a statement of self-
government  with  which  to  negotiate  the  management  of  the  space  with  the  Lazio regional 
government. In another case, the skills developed in participatory research flowed into the writing of 
a project presented by Lucha Y Siesta (GIOIA - Generate feminist cities through participation and 
inclusion) submitted for a call of the Department of Equal Opportunity on the theme of combating 
gendered violence. My inclusion in the team that should carry out the project if awarded is the result 
of both the relationships developed in the research and the dissemination of the results.  
With participants in some cases we attended conferences together, sharing the writing of the abstract, 
the presentation to the panel, and the ensuing discussion. As a result of this experience, we wrote a 
paper together, later published on a platform of relevance to the movement.
24
  
In addition, in the coming months the research will take the form of a popular text to be published by 
Armillaria, a publishing house run by one of the Lucha Y Siesta participants, which would like to 
convey the significant elements of the research to a non-academic audience. 
Part of the dissemination of the results also concerned the design of future tools such as, in the case 
of the Cagne Sciolte space, a fanzine on safer spaces, a photo-story on the history of the space, a

292 
 
science-fiction tale on a series of difficult stories lived inside the space and addressed by the collective 
action. We also discussed the possibility of producing a video in which we could visually give an 
account  of  the  history  of  the  space,  drawing on  the  many  archives  of  photos  and  videos  of  the 
participants that have never been used before, and combining them with excerpts from the interviews. 
In other cases, such as in the Spanish cases, because participation was relatively difficult due to the 
pandemic, dissemination is translated into connections between the spaces in Italy and the spaces in 
Spain towards future opportunities for encounter and collaboration. 
Quite naturally, the dissemination of results was more effective with those spaces where participation 
was most intense. 
PAR has affected the research and spaces as much as it has me. Understanding a series of dynamics, 
through the mediation of affect, has led me to a process of self-reflexivity and changes that have 
influenced my own life. In fieldnotes during ethnography at Lucha I wrote: “on the way home in the 
car I cry. I cannot find any other way to express the complexity of what I have experienced. I still 
cannot fully name the feelings I have experienced, but I feel that I am completely full, disoriented, 
confused. A great pain and a great fullness. The encounter with these women left me disarmed and I 
realised the poverty of tools I have to deal with this encounter. The relationship with women who 
have experienced violence is a field whose vocabulary I do not know. I think maybe I would like to 
do a course for an anti-violence desk operator. That this would be an integral part of my way of doing 
research, and that it seems necessary to me to hold and understand the relationships with people in 
the  field”  (Fieldnotes  LYS,  19-06-19).  Following  those  reflections,  some  time  later,  once  the 
fieldwork was finished, I participated in an anti-violence course organised by Lucha Y Siesta and I 
did an internship as an anti-violence worker in one of the centres run by them. At the moment, we are 
negotiating the possibility of joining the team of the anti-violence service, on a part-time basis. This 
experience has confronted me with a number of considerations. In the face of gender-based violence 
and feminist direct action, I felt that the academic research path could not fully solve my puzzle. Part 
of the understanding of that phenomenon could not come through academic formulation, but required 
for me another channel. The topic implicated me as well, and pushed me to want to relate in a different 
way as well. So my role in the relationships with the participants transited from researcher, to student, 
to collaborator. In this sense, the dissemination of the results took place, even on an individual level, 
in a way that was transformative for my life. 
This overview aims to contribute to experimentation in the field of PAR and social research as a tool 
for social change. The product of academic research, in fact, thanks to the relationships with the 
participants, can be translated into many forms that go beyond the boundaries of the academy and 
that can find a feedback and an effect in the social reality.

10.4 Limitations and Future Research 
 
The previous sections reported theoretical and methodological contributions of this research project. 
In this section, I would like to outline the limitations and future trajectories of the research.  
On  a  theoretical  level,  the  research  draws  on  three  strains  of  literature.  This  multidisciplinary 
approach has been both a virtue and a limitation of the research. Indeed, the various literatures have 
their own set of concepts, heritage, languages. Even if one wants to know all disciplines thoroughly, 
handling many literatures sometimes does not allow the level of depth and citation quality of the 
theoretical material. Moreover, working with CGTM allows to follow the literature that emerges from 
the  analysis  of  the  data.  This  process  risks  being  dispersive,  bringing  to  many  directions  and 
sometimes compromising the orientation, coherence, and compactness of the theoretical framework. 
Following the CGTM thread led me to focus on the theme of affect. It was the one that seemed to me 
to  emerge  prominently.  This  choice  came  at  the  expense  of  an  equally  in-depth  theoretical 
examination of other themes, such as urban space and urban movements, which had seemed central 
to me at the beginning of the research. 
In some cases, the manuscript presents theoretical contributions that may seem too generalised. In 
fact, ethnographic research considers specific cases, of which it advances an in depth understanding. 
The resulting theoretical findings are relative to that portion of social reality and as much as they may 
suggest trajectories for understanding more general reality, they cannot overinterpret their scope and 
agency. If this has happened, it is to be attributed to the limitations of the researcher's understanding 
and exposure of the results, and not to an over-stated self-representation of the participants.  
Moreover, the CGTM led me to consider the theoretical contribution as the most relevant output of 
the research. This theoretical aspiration was at times difficult to reconcile with the ethnographic and 
empirical character of the research. It was often difficult or ineffective to combine the expressiveness 
of the empirical material, the fieldnotes, the interviews, with the formulation of analytical categories 
sometimes  very  much  linked  to  theoretical  abstractions.  This  difficulty  sometimes  made  the 
presentation of the results intermittent, disjointed, and ineffective. 
Many limitations, as already mentioned, affect the application of PAR and CGTM. The ambitious 
attempt to combine these two approaches has often clashed with empirical reality. The application of 
PAR with different intensities can be contested as a lack of reliability of the empirical material, or an 
excessive variance in the application of the methodology. Furthermore, I was able to proceed with 
the creation of the code system by referring only to the Italian case. The fieldwork in Spain was 
postponed from March 2020 to January 2021 due to the outbreak of the pandemic. This shift made it 

294 
 
impossible to build the code system for both cases. The doctorate has time constraints, and it would 
have been impossible to proceed in the same way with the Spanish cases and submit the research on 
time.  For  this  reason,  the  analysis  of  the  Spanish  cases  consisted  in  applying  the  code  system 
previously developed on the Italian cases. This process, which partly responds to the theoretical 
saturation foreseen by CGTM, produced the inevitable loss of richness in the analysis of the Spanish 
cases, and a greater focus on aspects of similarity, rather than on any theoretical novelties brought by 
those cases.  
Moreover, the density of the ethnographic work has sometimes clouded the quality of the academic 
work. PAR is an immersive methodology that brings the researcher's work into play in a profound 
and  sometimes  difficult  way.  In  this  sense,  involvement  in  participant  relations  has  sometimes 
precluded the necessary distance for the formulation of quality theoretical work. The comparison with 
the Spanish case promised to mediate, open and modify this limitation, thanks to the intervention of 
a context less known to me, but this comparison took place under the condition of the limits posed 
by the pandemic. 
The eminently participatory nature of the research led me to report more on the innovation and 
effectiveness of the spaces, rather than the boundaries and limits of that type of collective action. This 
limitation responds, on the one hand, to my inability, while building relationships of intimacy and 
collaboration, to fully see contradictions, and on the other to a sense of responsibility towards the 
representation  of  feminist  spaces,  in  a  world  in  which  feminist  spaces  and  the  lives  of  women, 
lesbians, trans, and non-binary people are exposed to high levels of social inequality and attack.  
Research has met the human limit. Very often fatigue, exhaustion, saturation were a boundary in 
pursuing the research. Emotional, physical, or material limitations did not allow me to collect as many 
interviews as I would have liked, to persevere in the search for a contact, to be always present at the 
activities of the spaces when it would have been necessary. The flow of life, which goes beyond the 
research,  with  its  sorrows  and  mourning,  sometimes  caused  setbacks  or  drops  in  research 
performance.  Sometimes  it  was  impossible  for  me  to  continue  writing,  to  tap  into  a  source  of 
creativity that seemed to me to have dried up, or to deal with the emotions that the field, but above 
all beyond the field, lapped up. In some ways, the research tries to recompose this split between 
reason and passions. It attempts to look at passions also as a boundary to self-expectations, and that 
this may not be a failure, but a possibility to be authentic in the research process. 
These limitations open up future venues for research. On the one hand, in the deepening of the 
theoretical contribution that research so far has proposed. On the other hand, in the development of a 
more effective joining  of techniques between PAR and CGTM. Moreover, future research could 
more systematically address the relationship between feminist spaces and the political, economic, and 

295 
 
social structure, improving our understanding of a social phenomenon that, while limited in empirical 
data, may be capable of generating transformative consequences at a more general level. 
 
10.5 Epilogue  
 
 
This research focused on feminist spaces as safer spaces in urban contexts for women, lesbians, trans, 
and  non-binary  people.  Why  is  feeling  safe  still  a  political  claim,  in  a  world  where  gender 
mainstreaming has made its way into European policies, gender equality plans are mandatory for 
research bodies, and there seems to be some general awareness of social inequalities? 
In Italy, male violence against women affects 31.5% of women between the ages of 16 and 70. These 
data, reported by the ISTAT (National Institute of Statistical Research) survey hide a submerged part 
of the phenomenon, because violence is still considered a private matter, or a responsibility of women. 
The latest ISTAT report (L'effetto della pandemia sulla violenza di genere, 2021), dedicated to the 
effects of the pandemic on gendered violence, denounces the increase of the  phenomenon in 2020 
and 2021. Lockdowns and forced cohabitation situations in the domestic space have increased partner 
and cohabitant violence. Although it is still difficult to capture the long-term aspects, anti-violence 
centres report a marked increase in women’s requests for help.  
Violence against women is a widespread phenomenon that takes many forms: from physical to sexual 
violence,  from  psychological  to  economic  violence,  from  persecutory  acts  such  as  stalking  to 
feminicide. In addition to direct violence, women are also victims of structural violence, that is, 
violence that makes them invisible or diminishes their needs in many fields, from medical to urban. 
At the international level, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has taken a political 
stance against all forms of gender-based violence, adopting over the years a series of resolutions and 
recommendations calling for legally binding rules on preventing, protecting from, and combating the 
most widespread forms of gender-based violence, such as the Istanbul Convention (2011).  
Cities are often precluding personal and collective safety, the possibility of reconciling life and work. 
They expose women, lesbians, trans, and non-binary people to violence and inequalities with highly 
relevant  consequences  for  the  full  realisation of  a  good  life  and  the  achievement  of  full  rights 
(Oberhauser  et  al.  2017).  As  shown  by  several  studies  at  national  and  international  level,  data 
disaggregated by gender are very often lacking on many issues: starting from access to mobility, 
access to services, and the usability of public spaces (schoolyards, playgrounds, the walkability of 
squares and streets, other public places), housing and housing hardship. This lack of data and attention 
means that in urban design and planning the needs of this part of the population are not taken into

account. Thus, public spaces are inadequate and poorly usable, and they generate structural violence 
(Oberhauser et al. 2018). 
During  the  66th  United  Nations  Commission  on  the  Status  of  Women,  on  18  March  2022,  the 
international network of local authorities, United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), organised 
an event on feminist municipalism as an empowerment pathway for women towards the achievement 
of  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  Cities  like  Madrid,  Paris,  and  Vienna 
developed innovative strategies toward a gendered understanding of the urban space, and some of 
them collaborate in international networks, such as Gender Equal Cities and Gendered Landscape 
(URBACT). 
These elements are too little present in the public debate, and make the reaction to the phenomenon 
of gendered violence and gender inequalities disjointed, aphasic, or ineffective. Violence seems to be 
an emergency, a surprise, the result of a sudden burst, when in fact it is the mirror of a social structure. 
Feminist movements sensed that in the general silence, a response from below was necessary, and 
that the opening of spaces in the urban context would allow, on the one hand, to make violence a 
public and political issue, taken in charge by institutions and population, and on the other hand to 
change the fabric of the urban space itself. In this sense, feminist spaces represent a case for capturing 
collective action that address gender-based violence and produce social change. The change is not 
limited to the terrain of violence, but questions the economic model, the institutional set-up, the 
cultural paradigm. Breaking down the opposition between reason and emotion allows us to glimpse 
new spaces for collective action. The example of feminist spaces therefore refers not only to feminist 
movements, but more generally to a new relationship between social movements, affect, agency, and 
structure. The exploration of these spaces thus provides significant information about the quality of 
democracy and the forms of ongoing collective action that push to change its patterns in everyday 
life. 
 
At the end of the evening, when everyone has gone away, we go out into the garden. Someone 
comments that there is an eclipse and we all turn our eyes to the sky to look at the moon. Lena 
says that there is a very famous Italian singer in Romania, who did a song about the moon. Claudia 
comments that Lucha is one of the few places where boys and girls can see the moon in the 
neighbourhood, and also in the city. They often discover here what the moon looks like. Because 
the city is made of tall, attached buildings, from which you can't see the sky. Whereas here there 
is a large garden, an open space, and you just have to look up to see the stars and the moon. And 
the planes too. So children learn two things in Lucha: what the moon is and what planes are.  
When we go away, Lena looks out of the kitchen window, and starts the song about the moon by 
the Italian singer she likes so much. As we close the gate, we hear her humming to the rhythm of 
music. (Fieldnotes, LYS, 16-07-19) 
 
This episode, retrieved from the fieldwork in Lucha Y Siesta, tells of the aspiration of feminist spaces. 
Places of creation, where women, lesbians, trans and non-binary people learn to see the moon again.

The moon as the hidden side, often dismissed, of affect and emotions, and the comprehension of what 
that side allows to do.  
With eyes turned to the moon, to the rhythm of the song sung by Lena, this journey comes to an end.
