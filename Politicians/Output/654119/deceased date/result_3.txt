When Transnational Law helps growth

The launch of the UNIDROIT Factoring Model Law and subsequently the IFC/World Bank Factoring Regulatory Guide, coupled with the recently launched FCI Legal Study will greatly support the growth of factoring, receivables and supply chain finance globally but especially in the emerging markets.  This GTR article greatly encapsulates the importance of the Model Law in particular.

Factoring advocates hope new model law will boost market

Deputy Secretary General at HCCH - Hague Conference on Private International Law | Full Professor (Adjunct) at Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore

A historic moment to kick off a historic project: Yesterday we kicked off the HCCH-UNIDROIT Digital Assets and Tokens Joint Project with a meeting hosted at the premises of the HCCH - Hague Conference on Private International Law in The Hague. 

Nearly 50 experts from jurisdictions across the world and the two technical Secretariats met in person and online to discuss the questions to be asked in order to contour and scope the exploratory work for the Joint Project. 

Questions include

1. What definitions, terms and other considerations may be relevant when considering the scope of the study as relating to ‚Äúthe cross-border holdings and transfer of digital assets and tokens‚Äù?

2. What questions arise in relation to the determination of the law applicable in respect of a digital asset?

3. How can the principle of party autonomy be expressed?

4. Is further work on the matter of characterisation necessary?

5. Should more connecting factors be explored in determining the applicable law? If yes, which ones could be considered?

We now go to intersessional work, before meeting again in the Fall to discuss the report to be submitted to the respective governing bodies next year. 

With our friends at the UNIDROIT - International Institute for the Unification of Private Law Secretariat, we look forward to this year‚Äôs exploratory work with our distinguished group of identified experts.
