The reason for joining ZPM: Ma tawngkam:
I've seen the situation and situation of our country in the past, and I've learned more about the problems we have and how many things we have to do. I'm thinking about how I'm going to use the things in my mind and what I've experienced. *Politics is for the reform of the country and nation, not for their own benefit,* Many people say that our politicians are too concerned about their own benefit and money. It seems to be. Mizoram's rulers' working methods are being monitored by the fact that there are many things that cannot be improved by the existing system.


ZPM members said that they are trying to make Zoram with a new system. I think it is a good idea to study their objectives. Leisak te, the gap between the poor and the rich, the development of the country in Zoram, the party's politics is too drunk and the poor are not able to show their identity. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'm sure I'm going to be able to do that. After carefully considering God's invitation to join me, I left my comfort zone Bangalore and left Bangalore. I accepted the invitation.


Zoram Political System is a bad system. Even when a good and God-fearing person enters, he loves power and authority as I believe, he will corrupt him again' Retired pastors and retired pastors are also accused of entering politics because they want to reform Zoram. already it is a ni.


I invite others to join us to make a new system in Zoram.
