It is difficult to understand which one is eligible at the moment. In the LMC election, ZPM is expected to be high. However, the MLA election itself will not be as follows. ZPM members are not many. But they are the most excited. LMC-ah vote an hmu miau a. there is a ni. LMC is not included, voters are the majority, so they cannot be cared for.
Congress party members have been in a decline since the death of Pu S Laldingliana. Their workers are ngui a. Miriam L. Hrangchal is a candidate for the first time. The Congress atmosphere is increasing again. Congress has welcomed new members from the MNF. MNF Block leaders and unit leaders were welcomed.
Therefore, it is difficult to know what is going on.
