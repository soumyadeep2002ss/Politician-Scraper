To determine the frequency and characteristics of suspected drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) among the victims of sexual assault in Barcelona. Prospective study of every adult consulting an emergency service because of alleged sexual assault and receiving forensic assessment in the city of Barcelona in 2011. A total of 35 of 114 cases (30.7%) met suspected DFSA criteria. Compared with the other victims, suspected DFSA cases were more likely to experience amnesia, to have been assaulted by night, after a social situation and by a recently acquainted man, to have used alcohol before the assault and to be foreigners. In this group ethanol was detected in blood or urine in 48.4% of analyzed cases; their mean back calculated blood alcohol concentration was 2.29g/l (SD 0.685). Also, at least one central nervous system drug other than ethanol was detected in 60,6%, mainly stimulant drugs of abuse. Suspected DFSA is frequent among victims of alleged sexual assault in Barcelona nowadays. The depressor substance most commonly encountered is alcohol, which contributes to victims' vulnerability.

Public Space in Barcelona (1992-2017) - Evolution and Case Studies

Science.gov (United States)

Sanfeliu Arboix, Ignacio; MartÃ­n, EstefanÃ­a

2017-10-01

The construction of the public space has become in the last decades something so important and fundamental in the architecture of the cities, that requires a specific discipline and a concrete study that evaluates the characteristics and actions on it. Not already from an urbanistic perspective but from its own design and constructive perspective, with its character as a place for everyone and for everything, must gather a series of elements that are unique to this space. Barcelona is one of the densest cities in the world that, since the end of the s. XX until our days, tries to solve the public space with a design of quality and optimum. The shortage of public space, which also hosts more than eight million tourists each year, makes it necessary to propose a type of meticulous intervention in order to accommodate all types of users and activities. From the first Universal Exhibition of 1888 through 1929 to the 1992 Olympics as the most important stimulus for this renewal of urban space, Barcelona has been rethinking and evolving in the modus operandi in terms of its urban space. From our professional experience as architects both in the municipal, private and university spheres, we believe that it is our responsibility to confer the public space, that is to say, the design of the urban infrastructure with the attributes necessary to consolidate it in a space Suitable for all without exception and as a place of expression of citizenship. Through the projects of public space developed in our office we will analyze this change of procedure in the construction of squares, parks and other spaces in the city of Barcelona.

The ecodesign and planning of sustainable neighbourhoods: the Vallbona case study (Barcelona

Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)

Farreny, R.

2011-10-01

Full Text Available Global sustainability is increasingly an issue of urban sustainability, being essential to encourage more benign trajectories of urbanisation. For this, there is need for a framework that could aid in the process of designing and redesigning (retrofitting cities. The aim of this paper is to present and describe the methodology of urban ecodesign, which is characterized by a systematic incorporation of environmental life cycle considerations into the design of urban systems. The paper presents a case study of neighbourhood ecodesign from the city of Barcelona (Vallbona neighbourhood. This practical experience shows that the inclusion of sustainability criteria at an early stage of the design and planning of urban systems is the best strategy for environmental protection.In addition; a methodological framework is described in order to provide planners with a structured way of designing urban settlements so as to move towards sustainable urban environments.

La sostenibilidad global es cada vez mÃ¡s un tema de sostenibilidad urbana. Por este motivo, es necesario un marco de trabajo que pueda ayudar en el proceso de diseÃ±o y rediseÃ±o (rehabilitaciÃ³n de nuestras ciudades. El objetivo de este trabajo es presentar y describir la metodologÃ­a de ecodiseÃ±o adaptada a los entornos urbanos, la cual se caracteriza por la incorporaciÃ³n sistemÃ¡tica de las consideraciones ambientales a lo largo de su ciclo de vida. El documento presenta un caso de estudio de ecodiseÃ±o del barrio de Vallbona (Barcelona. Esta experiencia demuestra que la inclusiÃ³n de criterios de sostenibilidad en las etapas iniciales de diseÃ±o y planificaciÃ³n de los sistemas urbanos es la mejor estrategia para la prevenciÃ³n ambiental. AdemÃ¡s, se presenta un marco metodolÃ³gico con el fin de proporcionar a los planificadores una forma estructurada de diseÃ±o de los asentamientos urbanos que les permita avanzar hacia entornos urbanos mÃ¡s sostenibles.

Impact of glucose-lowering agents on the risk of cancer in type 2 diabetic patients. The Barcelona case-control study.

Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)

Rafael SimÃ³

Full Text Available BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of glucose-lowering agents in the risk of cancer in a large type 2 diabetic population. METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted within a defined cohort (275,164 type 2 diabetic patients attending 16 Primary Health Care Centers of Barcelona. Cases (nâ€Š=â€Š1,040 comprised those subjects with any cancer diagnosed between 2008 and 2010, registered at the Cancer Registry of Hospital Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona. Three control subjects for each case (nâ€Š=â€Š3,120 were matched by age, sex, diabetes duration, and geographical area. The treatments analyzed (within 3 years prior to cancer diagnosis were: insulin glargine, insulin detemir, human insulin, fast-acting insulin and analogues, metformin, sulfonylureas, repaglinide, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and alpha glucosidase inhibitors. Conditional logistic regressions were used to calculate the risk of cancer associated with the use of each drug adjusted by age, BMI, dose and duration of treatment, alcohol use, smoking habit, and diabetes duration. RESULTS: No differences were observed between case and control subjects for the proportion, dose or duration of exposure to each treatment. None of the types of insulin and oral agents analyzed showed a significant increase in the risk of cancer. Moreover, no cancer risk was observed when glargine was used alone or in combination with metformin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that diabetes treatment does not influence the risk of cancer associated with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, an eventual increase of cancer should not be a reason for biasing the selection of any glucose-lowering treatment in type 2 diabetic population.

ensemble of regional models (ENSEMBLES project) have been also considered. Flood events have been obtained from newspapers, reports and insurance data. The role played by prevention measures, particularly in the specific case of Barcelona, which has been recognized by UNISDR (United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction) as resilient city in front of floods, is also presented. Results confirm the strong role played by the increase of urban surface (from less than 15% in 1956 to near 40% in 2009) and explore future adaptation measures in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This work has been supported by the Spanish project HOPE and the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, and developed by an interdisciplinary team that include experts from hydrology, meteorology, geography, environmental sciences and architecture.

The aim of this study was to determine the evolution of HIV infection, gonorrhea, syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and their epidemiological characteristics in Barcelona city. Population-based incidence study of all newly occurring diagnoses of HIV infection, syphilis, gonorrhea and LGV detected in Barcelona between January 2007 and December 2011. A descriptive analysis was performed. The annual incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants were calculated by sex, sexual conduct and educational level. To estimate global sex-specific rates we used the Barcelona city census; for the calculation of rates by sexual conduct and educational level we used estimates of the Barcelona Health Interview Survey. Trends were analysed using the chi-squared test for linear trend. HIV. 66.8 % of the HIV cases were men who had sex with men (MSM). The incidence rates in MSM over the study period were from 692.67/100,000 to 909.88/100,000 inh. Syphilis. 74.2 % of the syphilis cases were MSM. The incidence rates in MSM were from 224.9/100,000 to 891.97/100,000 inh. and the MSM with a university education ranged from 196.3/100,000 to 1020.8/100,000. Gonorrhea. 45.5 % of the gonorrhea cases were MSM. The incidence rates in MSM were from 164.24/100,000 to 404.79/100,000 inh. and the MSM with university education ranged from 176.7/100,000 to 530.1/100,000 inh.. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). 95.3 % of the LGV cases are MSM. The incidence rates in MSM were from 24.99/100,000 to 282.99/100,000 inh. and the MSM with university education ranged from 9.3/100,000 to 265/100,000 inh. An increase in cases of STI was observed. These STI mainly affected MSM with a university education. Continuing to monitor changes in the epidemiology of STI, and identifying the most affected groups should permit redesigning preventive programs, with the goal of finding the most efficient way to reach these population groups.

Study of the radioactive contents in Barcelona's water supply during 1986

International Nuclear Information System (INIS)

Ortega, X.; Valles, I.

1988-01-01

Throughout 1986 several determinations were carried out of the contents in Î± and Î² radioactivity transmitters of different samples of the Barcelona water supply. It could be verified that beta radioactivity was ten times higher in the waters collected in the basin of Llobregat river than water from Ter river. Both rivers are the main sources of Barcelona supply. The reason for this unbalanced result is the high potassic content of the first river, coming from the mining exploitation of the basin. On the other hand, the contamination that could be measured in May, due to the Chernobyl nuclear accident, showed that the supply system from Llobregat river was more sensitive to the incorporation of contaminants carried down by the rain, whereas in the case of Ter river, owing to the presence of impounding regulation, a higher retention time of these waters was obtained.

Cornado, Cossima; Garcia-Almirall, Pilar; Vima, Sara; Vila Busqued, Gemma; Uzqueda, Angel

2017-10-01

In a context of a shifting environmental, economic and social paradigm, European cities face a situation that is at the same time challenge and opportunity: the need for urban rehabilitation of the vulnerable degraded socio residential fabric. Public administrations in big cities and metropolitan areas are confronted with both the undercurrent need of actualization of the built stock and the rise of urban residential vulnerability. The city of Barcelona, as many others, is the result of multiple phenomena with high urban and social consequences. The socio spatial integration of immigrant population, the touristic rise and gentrification processes are current situations simultaneously taking place in the city. In parallel, a framework of economic crisis in which public investments in urban and social matters decrease, provides a temporal juncture that results into an increase of social polarization and socio economic inequality that becomes evident and expressed in the territory. This research focuses in the case of Barcelona, and presents a methodology based on a system of indicators elaborated through the exploitation of statistical data complemented with very specific data supplied by the Barcelona City Council. The accurate knowledge of socio demographic, socioeconomic and residential and urban characteristics is crucial in order to define the very complex urban dynamics that describe in the city neighbourhoods and areas. Residential vulnerability is defined as an assembly of objective conditions that relate to residential space and indicate situations of social discrimination and structural disadvantage of the population, related to a specific time and context. Thus, it is relevant to analyse the concentration of certain indicators of vulnerability in specific places or neighbourhoods, to contrast its effect on the socio-residential situation and its temporal evolution in order to identify tendencies. The present study contributes to the identification of data

New mediterranean elements in contemporary housing. The case of Barcelona

Directory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)

Vincenzo Paolo Bagnato

2012-10-01

Full Text Available In the face of increasing and differentiating the low-cost housing demand and the trend of establishing new paradigms in the contemporary housing design, the architectural investigation has replaced into its disciplinary statement the topic of housing as central question in research and design experimentation. The city of Barcelona has codified in the last years innovative modalities of public management in social housing, offering interesting points of reflection on the idea of housing and of Mediterranean quality in urban, architectural and constructive terms. The paper proposes a key to the reading on the recent experiences of social housing in Barcelona illustrating the different forms through which architecture interprets the relationship between housing and public space, between innovation and constructive tradition.

Full Text Available This article shows some unpublished data that seek to clarify the origins of football in Spain and particularly in Barcelona. Apart from the influence of the English colony in the dissemination of football, the background of school sport is described and evaluated. It is provided data about football in Barcelona which reveal that before the constitution of the Football Club Barcelona, often considered the first team of the city, there were ten associations that practiced this sport. It emphasizes the importance of the British colony, gyms and sports clubs of Barcelona from 1892 to 1903, to generate the enabling environment that made â€‹â€‹the modern sport of football triumph, stimulating in turn the context Regenerationism and the emergence of associations sports from the early twentieth century. The research method has focused on historical analysis techniques, with the treatment of the original documentary sources and complemented with historicist indirect sources.ResumenEn este artÃ­culo se presentan algunos datos inÃ©ditos que pretenden esclarecer los orÃ­genes del fÃºtbol en EspaÃ±a y mÃ¡s concretamente en Barcelona.

Full Text Available Since the late twentieth century, the duality tourism and cinema, commonly referred to as film-induced tourism, has become one of the most emerging and dynamic tourist modalities. Amongst the various types of film-induced tourism accepted by the academia, this research has been based on one that has a double filmic identity: as film destination and as film setting. Meaning a film that is shot in a particular place but is actually representing elsewhere. The main objective of this research is to identify and analyse the international audio-visual productions or co-productions that have been partially or completely shot in Barcelona yet in fiction represent another city. The results were essentially obtained from an analytical-descriptive methodology. As a main conclusion of the study, it can be stated that international films which are shot in Barcelona but represent elsewhere in the film, have great potential to strengthen or create a competitive offer of film-induced tourism in Barcelona.

The Do.Co.Mo.Moâ€™s. database, referring to Barcelona, lists 34 buildings that could be classified as rationalists and / or modern. According to other sources, we could reach fifty constructed buildings between the late 1920s and the end of the war in Spain. The article presents the results of a field work that, using different sources, has tried to to order and record the architectural production that can be considered modern / rationalist in Barcelona in the 1920s and 1930s
