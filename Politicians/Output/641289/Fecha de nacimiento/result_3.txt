Zurab Pololikashvili, Secretary-General of the UN Tourism

Prior to this, he worked in a number of high-level roles in both the private and public sectors.  After graduating with a degree in banking, Mr. Pololikashvili gained extensive experience in the private sector, including with a prominent role in one of Georgia’s biggest banks and as CEO of the country’s leading football team, FC Dinamo Tbilisi.

RETHINKING TOURISM

Tourism can drive the global recovery, but restarting it must be done responsibly, requiring political will and investments.

The agenda of Italy’s G20 presidency is built on three core pillars: ‘People, Planet and Prosperity’. Undoubtedly, in the 22 years since the G20 was first established at the level of finance ministers and central bank governors, much progress has been made in each of these areas.

INTERNATIONAL TOURISM CAN THRIVE AGAIN — BUT NOT WITHOUT POLITICAL WILL

Despite the global vaccine roll out, the world still faces paralyzing uncertainty. The third wave of COVID-19 has caused countries to close travel corridors and even introduce forced hotel quarantine for all arrivals. It’s safe to say that global tourism stands at a crucial juncture, stuck between an ongoing crisis and the welcome prospect of revitalization in the near future.

Around the world, in countries at all development levels, many millions of jobs and businesses are dependent on a strong and thriving tourism sector.

STEPPING UP SUPPORT FOR A SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE RECOVERY OF TOURISM

Tourism is a major driver of the world economy, accounting for 7 per cent of international trade. Globally, tourism generates directly or indirectly one in every ten jobs. The COVID-19 crisis has devastated the tourism economy, with unprecedented effects on jobs and businesses. Tourism was one of the first sectors to be deeply affected by the COVID-19 containment measures...

UNLESS WE TAKE THESE STEPS, UK QUARANTINE RESTRICTIONS AGAINST SPAIN WILL DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD

As well as undermining public trust and confidence – precious commodities that have taken months to rebuild

TO HELP PREVENT A BAD RECESSION FROM TURNING INTO A MAJOR DEPRESSION, IT’S VITAL WE BRING IN A GLOBALISED TEST, TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM FOR CORONAVIRUS

There’s no way the global economy will come roaring back without the engine of tourism behind it.
For obvious reasons, though, many people are reluctant to travel.
Short of a vaccine, what can restore their confidence?

HOW TO RESCUE GLOBAL TOURISM FROM THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

Some fear that COVID-19 has halted globalization’s progress, eroding international cooperation, and decimating a primary driver of our interconnectedness: tourism. For those who are dedicated to global harmony and mutual engagement, or simply concerned about the future viability and prosperity as a sector, these outcomes are unacceptable.

ONLY THROUGH HISTORIC TRANSFORMATION CAN GLOBAL TOURISM BEAT COVID-19

Globally, the sector is amongst the world’s top employers. International tourism represents 7% of total exports and is the world’s third-largest export category by earnings, after chemicals and fuels. In Europe alone, tourism generated almost $410 billion in revenues in 2019 and provided more than 27 million jobs. In short, tourism is central to the global economic machinery.

TOURISM RAISES ITS VOICE FOR PEACE

After two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, people, as well as our whole societies and economies, have suffered enough. We cannot afford for this to continue. We must rebuild and look to the future with hope, not fear.

MAKING TOURISM STRONGER AND READY FOR THE FUTURE

This has been another challenging year for our societies, our economies and tourism. Many millions of jobs and businesses remain in peril, at the mercy of an evolving crisis and of the actions of governments.

Determination
TOURISM LOOKS FORWARD WITH DETERMINATION

We are almost at the end of what has been the most challenging year in the history of tourism.
Almost overnight, the pandemic brought global tourism to a complete standstill.

COVID-19 AND TRANSFORMING TOURISM

If tourism brings us together, then travel restrictions keep us apart.
More importantly, restrictions on travel also prevent tourism from delivering on its potential to build a better future for all.

Leadership
NO TIME FOR TIMID LEADERSHIP

Between January and May, the sudden and rapid fall in tourist arrivals cost an estimated $320 billion. That’s three times greater than the impact of the Great Recession of 2007-2009 on our sector – and this is just for the first five months of the year.

SOLIDARITY AND CONFIDENCE

This goes hand-in-hand with a responsibility to preserve the spirit of international solidarity that has characterized our response to this shared crisis, a response that has included international institutions, the civil society at large and individual citizens.

Resolve
LOOKS TO THE FUTURE

Across Europe, the responsible restart of tourism is now underway. But even as growing numbers of tourists cross borders and businesses open up again, this is no time for complacency.

 

Tourism Restarts
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES REMAIN

Four months ago, UN Tourism asked its Members, the tourism sector and tourists themselves for patience. To stay at home for today so we could travel again tomorrow.

Tomorrow is now here.
