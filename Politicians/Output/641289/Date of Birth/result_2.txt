The industrial engineer, graduated from the Javeriana University, is president of Fenalco, the merchants' union and one of the largest in the country, with 18,000 affiliates.

This appointment reinforces the payroll of Vallecaucanos, which as we tell in this story, send the stop in the country's guilds. He also keeps the guild at the head of a conservative trend leader, something that has been happening since the 80s when Fenalco was chaired by the conservative Sabas Pretelt de la Vega and remained when in 2003 they appointed the former Minister of Defense, Guillermo Botero.

Cabal sancomente is a member of a traditional conservative family of Bugueño landowners.

His professional career has been marked by union positions and political designations.

He was president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, APOI, between 1994 and 1999, a time when this guild was much more powerful than today. In fact, since COPI he presided over the National Guild Council between 1998 and 1999, ending the Samper government. This position was delicate because at this time the entrepreneurs of the union council opposed the administration of Samper, accused of receiving money for its campaign of the Cali poster, in a scandal that was known as the 8,000 process.

De Acopi left when the conservative president Andrés Pastrana Arango appointed him Minister of Economic Development, replacing the Cartagena Fernando Araújo Perdomo, who left the portfolio a month after the Attorney General's Office and the Prosecutor's Office opened an investigation for the Chambacú case.

In his two years in the Ministry, Cabal promoted Law 550, which created a more modern figure to save companies in serious economic problems, and the MIPYME Law that created the promotion fund for medium, small and micro business and put more conditions and put more conditions laxas in terms of procedures and taxes.

"The economy in the presidency of Pastrana was bad, but these were achieved to show," a Fenalco official told us.

He went out to launch Colombia by Senate, the political movement that endorsed Noemí Sanín in that year and for which Senator Mauricio Pepiento came out, then condemned by parapolitics. Cabal burned with 37 thousand votes against 44 thousand pepper (he had already been on the list of the pastranista new democratic force in 1991).

Upon full departure to the guild of hoteliers, the Hotel and Tourist Association of Colombia, Cotelco where he was almost ten years, and from where he also held strategic positions such as the presidency of the Chamber of Tourism of Colombia and the Latin American Federation of Hotels and tourism.

At the same time, he was a legal representative in Colombia from Air Madrid, a low -cost airline that flew from Bogotá to Madrid between 2004 and its bankruptcy at the end of 2006.

While in that position he threw himself again to the Senate, now as a conservative, and burned with 24,000 votes. For that move of launching to politics whileAfter he was at the head of the guild, Cabal received criticism as seen in this article.

Then he reassured his position in Cotelco.

For the 2010 elections he was one of the "notable" conservatives who signed a letter of support to Juan Manuel Santos's campaign despite the fact that this party had as an official candidate Noemí Sanín.

He left Cotelco in 2011 when the then President Juan Manuel Santos appointed him Ambassador in South Korea. From there he led the negotiations of the Free Trade Agreement with that country, which was controversial because the industrialists of the auto parts sector mainly, feared that the opening of this market could harm its sales.

After the negotiations, the Austrian Embassy passed in 2014, a position that is important not so much for bilateral relations but because in Vienna several international organizations headquarters, of which the most important for Colombia are probably the Office of the Nations Unit For drugs and crime, UNODC, and the United Nations Commission for International Commercial Law, Uncitral.

Cabal left that embassy in June 2019, to apply as general secretary of the World Tourism Organization. He lost to Georgia's politician, Zurab Pololikashvili, but was appointed as deputy general secretary of the World Tourism Organization, based in Madrid. From there he returned to Colombia to return to the union sector.

Cabal studied high -direction at the University of Los Andes and the Inalde Business School, has a master's degree in Economics of the American University of Washington D.C, and has done courses at the University of Georgetown, the University of South Carolina and the Complutense University of Madrid.
