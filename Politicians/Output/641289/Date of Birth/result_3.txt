Jaime Alberto Cabal Sanclemente is the new president of Fenalco

The National Federation of Merchants (Fenalco) reported the appointment of Jaime Alberto Cabal sancomente as its new president, through an official statement. The taking of functions will be done next week during the General Assembly.




Jaime Alberto Cabal Sanclemente is the new president of Fenalco in Colombia - UNWTO


Jaime Alberto Cabal Sancelemte will take the reins of the Federation in replacement of Pedro Marún, who leaves the position less than a year after his nomination between scandals linked to corruption. The latter in turn received the presidency of Guillermo Botero Nieto, who exercised in this role for more than 15 years, before linking to the government of President Ivan Duque in the second half of 2018.

Cabal sancomente was the first Colombian to occupy the position of deputy general secretary in the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in 2018, after having exercised as Colombian ambassador to Austria and in Korea, in addition to having held the post of Minister of Development Economic, among other roles.

The new president of the Colombian merchants' guild is a graduated industrial engineer from the Javeriana University, with a specialization at the University of Los Andes and the Inalde Business School. The brand new president of Fenalco is also an economist at Georgetown University in Washington, with a master's degree in Economics from American University.

Jaime Alberto assumes the direction of the maximum trade association of merchants in Colombia, a sector that is in recovery period after difficult years due to political and economic instability. In the first months of the year, the sector has seen a general recovery above 5 %, although it continues to be affected by the excessive increase in imports, smuggling and illegal trade.
