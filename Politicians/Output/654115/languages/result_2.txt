Had this existed when I was a child, I might not have become a lawyer. 

Last week, with little fanfare, a wonderful book was published open source: Astronomy as a Field: A Guide for Aspiring Astrophysicists. 

Written by women in astronomy for girls looking to work in the field, it is chock full of insights and information that seek to lower barriers to entry to this fascinating field. As the blurb says:

“This book was created as part of the SIRIUS B VERGE program to orient students to astrophysics as a broad field. The 2023-2024 VERGE program and the printing of this book is funded by the Women and Girls in Astronomy Program via the International Astronomical Union's North American Regional Office of Astronomy for Development and the Heising-Simons Foundation; as a result, this document is written by women in astronomy for girls who are looking to pursue the field. However, given its universal nature, the material covered in this guide is useful for anyone interested in pursuing astrophysics professionally.”

Good for children, regardless of gender identity who, like little me once upon a time, looked to the skies with wishful eyes that the understanding of how small we are in the cosmos may bring us lasting peace and purpose. 

Perhaps the law, coupled with a passion for the universe, wasn’t a bad choice for this woman after all. 

Links to the full book in the comments below. 

Absolutely tremendous read and highly recommended. Knowledge is power.

Il movimento femminista in Italia 👇

Semia - Fondo delle Donne

Abbiamo mappato oltre mille realtà che si occupano di questioni di genere in Italia, che cosa abbiamo scoperto?

🌱 Il 70% delle organizzazioni è di piccole dimensioni.
🌱 L'85% delle persone ci lavora su base volontaria.
🌱 L'autofinanziamento è la fonte primaria di sostentamento, spesso l'unica.

Partiamo da qui per costruire una filantropia femminista come non si è mai vista in Italia!

Great piece 👇 by Sorley McCaughey  on the power of the law - and the democratic debate that comes with it- to make the transition that our planet needs a shared priority

I had this piece published last week
Legislation to protect our oceans should be an easy win for our government in our fight to hold back the climate crisis
Lots of competing legislation - especially in Department of Housing- but given the scale of the climate crisis facing us, I make the argument that the Marine Protected Areas legislation needs to be prioritised

Opinion: We’re swimming in a solution to climate change - so why aren’t we protecting it?
