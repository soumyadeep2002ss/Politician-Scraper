Circular ICCAT # 11091/2023
 
Subject: Call of offers - terms of reference- Continuation of
The collection and analysis of biological samples to determine the
Age and growth of tropical tunas
 
It is crucial to obtain biological samples to determine the age and growth of tropical tunas
captured in the Atlantic, in order to improve current knowledge about these parameters
Essential for the next stock evaluation of these species. Consequently, these terms of
Reference aim to continue the collection of hard parts and biological tunas samples
Tropical in the Atlantic, focusing on the lagoons identified for the next evaluations. Besides,
These terms of reference represent a continuation of age and growth studies
carried out during the tropical tuna marking program of the Atlantic Ocean (Aottp). Therefore,
Activities will include the collection and treatment of additional samples of Rabil, Patudo and List,
Although short -term data analysis will focus on the rabil and patudo.
 
Therefore ICCAT would like to request a budget for said work, which will be developed in accordance
with the terms of reference attached to this letter. The detailed offer will be sent only to the
Attention from Mr. Camille Jean Pierre Manel, Executive Secretary of ICCAT, and with a copy to Mrs. Ana
Martínez, to the following directions: Camille.manel@iccat.int and Ana.martinez@iccat.int no later than 20
October 2023 (12:00 p.m. Madrid).
 
I would appreciate it to distribute these terms of reference among the qualified people who can
Be interested.
 
Sincerely,
 
Executive Secretary

Terms of Reference 
 
Continuation of the collection and analysis of  
biological samples for age and growth of tropical tunas 
 
 
1. Introduction  
 
It  is  crucial  to  obtain  biological  samples  for  age  and  growth  of  tropical  tuna  targeted  in  the  Atlantic.  This 
Terms of Reference aims to continue the collection of hard parts and biological samples from tropical tuna 
in the Atlantic with a focus on gaps identified for upcoming assessments. This ToR represents a continuation 
of age and growth studies carried out during the Atlantic Ocean Tropical Tuna tagging Programme (AOTTP). 
The activities will therefore include the collection and processing of additional samples of YFT, BET and SKJ, 
though the data analysis in the short term will focus on YFT and BET. 
 
 
2. Contractor tasks  
 
The  Contractor  will  work  in  close  consultation  with  the  ICCAT  Secretariat  and  will  provide  a  detailed 
description of how work will be progressed on the continued collection and ageing of specimens of tropical 
tuna. Ideally, sampling should take advantage of data already collected by the AOTTP.  Specific size classes 
of interest are summarised below by species: 
 
− For YFT, the work should focus on age/length sampling of tuna ≤65 cm SFL (straight fork length), 
but particularly fish < 30cm SFL.  
 
− For BET, the work should focus on age/length sampling of tuna ≤50 cm SFL (straight fork length) 
and >150 cm SFL.  
 
− For SKJ, the work should focus on improving the overall database of age/length samples. 
 
All samples should be processed, but the analysis (ageing and determination of growth curves by sex where 
feasible) will be developed for YFT and BET and be combined with current growth curves for presentation 
to the SCRS. 
 
Where possible, the Contractor shall ensure that biological sampling and analysis is conducted regionally.  
As such, tenders should be made on a regional and collaborative basis by consortia, other than applications 
by single institutions or individuals.  
 
The working proposal and the Contractor should be responsible for the following:  
 
a) Routine hard part collection 
 
− Collection of otoliths (and spines/vertebrae where available) with a focus on under-represented 
sizes for the three species. 
 
− Provide a detailed description of the biological sampling scheme (biological sampling by regions, 
type of biological samples to be collected and analysed), number of fish to be sampled by month 
if possible, taking into consideration the targets set out above.  
 
− Follow the protocols contained in the Chapter 4 of the ICCAT Manual for the collection of samples 
and the suggestions made during the Workshop held in February 2020 for analysis of the growth 
data.

− The biological sampling  period should  be as long as possible, noting  that the contract duration. 
Therefore,  the  proposal  should  include  the  chronogram  of  activities  and  respective  budget,  a 
detailed description of the methodology to be used, the expected results for this analysis, and the 
full cost of the analyses. The minimum information to be reported includes the length-frequency 
of samples, fish metadata (date, location, etc.), age readings (calendar and fractional), age error 
matrices,  and  bias  analyses  (like  Evans-Hoenig  and  Bowker  symmetry  tests)  produced  from 
testing their reads against the reference set. 
 
b) Sample processing 
 
− Where available, update the relationship between otoliths, spines, and vertebrae.  
 
c) Analysis of processed simples 
 
− Where available, update growth estimates  
− Where available, updated maximum age  
 
d) Reporting 
 
− Provide a report summarizing the results for work undertaken. 
 
 
3. Contractor minimum qualifications  
 
− Documented  multi-year  experience  in  tropical  tunas research  and/or  research  on  large  pelagic 
species with experience in fishery data collection.  
 
− University  degree  in  one  of  the  following:  fisheries  science,  marine  biology,  statistics,  natural 
sciences, biological sciences, environmental sciences, or closely related fields (in case of individual 
scientists).  
 
− Excellent working knowledge of one of the three official languages of ICCAT (English, French or 
Spanish). A high level of knowledge of English is desirable.  
 
 
4. Deliverables  
 
1. A  first  deliverable  should  be  prepared  as  a  SCRS  document/presentation  with  un  update  of  the 
preliminary  results  to  be  provided  to  the  Secretariat  to  be  presented  during  the  Yellowfin  Tuna 
Data Preparatory meeting in 2024.  
 
2. A  second  deliverable  should  be provided  ahead  of  the  SCRS  species  group  meeting  (September 
2024), which will be considered the draft final report of the contract, which shall be prepared as a 
SCRS document and describe the activities carried out during the contract period 
 
These  works  should  be  concluded  by 31  May  2024,  although  a  possible  extension  may  be  granted  at  no 
cost, in case the Secretariat can reach an agreement with the major funder. 
 
5. Payment details  
 
Disbursement will be made according to the following schedule:
