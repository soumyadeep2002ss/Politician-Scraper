ICCAT
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)
Legal Basis:

The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (“ICCAT” or the “Commission”) is a regional fisheries management organization (“RFMO”) established by the Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (the “Convention”), prepared and adopted at a Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1966. The Convention entered into force in 1969.
Member States:

ICCAT has 48 Contracting Parties: Albania, Algeria, Angola, Barbados, Belize, Brazil, Canada, Cape Verde, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, European Community, France (St. Pierre & Miquelon), Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Honduras, Iceland, Japan, South Korea, Libya, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Philippines, Russia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, St. Tome and Principe, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, United Kingdom (Overseas Territories), United States, Uruguay, Vanuatu and Venezuela. Pursuant to Article XIV of the Convention, the Convention remains open for signature by the government of any state which is a member of the United Nations (“UN”) or any of the UN’s specialized agencies. Instruments of ratification or approval are to be deposited with the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (“FAO”).

Article XIV(4) of the Convention also permits “any inter-governmental economic integration organization constituted by States that have transferred to it competence over the matters governed by th[e] Convention, including the competence to enter into treaties in respect of those matters” to sign and/or adhere to the Convention. Upon the deposit of formal confirmation or adherence, any such organization will be considered a full Contracting Party; however, that organization’s member states shall thereby cease to be separate parties to the Convention, and are to transit a formal notification to that effect to the Director-General of the FAO.

In addition, pursuant to the 2003 Recommendation by ICCAT on Criteria for Attaining the Status of Cooperating Non-Contracting Party, Entity or Fishing Entity in ICCAT, the Commission will also grant the special status of “Cooperator” to interested parties, a status which bestows many of the same rights and obligations as enjoyed by the Contracting Parties.
Geographical Scope:

The Convention applies to “all waters of the Atlantic Ocean, including the adjacent Seas.”
Legal Personality:

ICCAT is an intergovernmental organization responsible for the conservation of tunas and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent waters. Pursuant to a 1971 agreement between ICCAT and Spain, the Commission’s permanent seat is located in Madrid, and the Spanish Government has recognized ICCAT’s juridical personality and its capacity to enter into contracts, to purchase and dispose of personal property and real estate, and to initiate legal action. In addition, the Spanish Government has recognized the inviolability of the Commission’s premises and its correspondence, agreed not to impede the passage to or from the Seat of persons having official functions to perform therein or otherwise invited by ICCAT, accorded jurisdictional immunity and immunity from execution to the Commission’s property and assets, and exempted the Commission from all taxes.

%20at%20each regular Commission meeting, and with the elections, the Commission is to give “due consideration to the geographic, tuna fishing and tuna processing interests of the Contracting Parties,” as well as to “the equal right of the Contracting Parties to be represented on the Council.”

The Executive Secretary is appointed by the Commission and oversees ICCAT’s day-to-day administration and staff. As directed by the Commission, the Executive Secretary is authorized to: (a) coordinate programs of investigation by the Contracting Parties; (b) prepare budget estimates for the Commission; (c) account for and disburse funds of the Commission in accordance with its budget; (d) arrange for cooperation with other international organizations; (e) prepare the collection and analysis of data necessary to accomplish the Commission’s work, particularly data relating to the current and maximum sustainable catch of tuna stocks; and (f) prepare for approval by the Commission of scientific, administrative and other reports of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies. The Executive Secretary is also charged, in consultation with the Chairman, with preparing the provisional agenda for each regular meeting of the Commission, according to the procedures set forth in Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure.

The Convention also provides for the establishment of several Panels to carry out the Convention’s objectives, with the Panels grouped by species and/or geographic area. Individual Panels: (a) are responsible for collecting and reviewing scientific information relating to the species or geographic area under their purview; (b) may propose recommendations to the Commission for joint action by the Contracting Parties on the basis of their scientific investigations; and (c) may recommend to the Commission studies and investigations, or coordination of such studies and investigations among Contracting Parties, that are necessary to obtain information relating to their mandates.

The Commission is charged with establishing individual Panels, which hold regular meetings in conjunction with the regular meetings of the Commission. Membership on any particular Panel is open to all Contracting Parties who wish to join, upon written notification to the Chairman of the Commission. Each Contracting Party may be represented on a Panel by its delegates or alternates, as assisted by experts or advisers. Currently, four such Panels have been established: Tropical Tunas (yellowfin, bigeye and skipjack); Northern Temperate Tunas (albacore and Atlantic bluefin); Southern temperate tunas (albacore and southern bluefin); and Other Species (swordfish, billfishes and small tunas).

ICCAT has also established two standing committees. The first, the Standing Committee on Finance and Administration, is responsible for advising the Commission on matters relating to the Executive Secretary and staff, the budget of the Commission, the time and place of meetings of the Commission and Commission publications. In addition, ICCAT has established a Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (“SCRS”), which develops and recommends to the Commission policies and procedures relating to the collection, compilation, analysis and dissemination of fishery statistics for the Convention area, and reviews the Commission’s various research programs. Any Contracting Party may join either standing committee.

As noted in the ICCAT Field Manual, “[p]ractically all of the Commission’s scientific work and data collection efforts are accomplished by the Contracting Parties themselves. The Secretariat’s role is more of being a focal point for data collation/assimilation and coordinating access by scientists to the common databases.”
Relationships:

Article XI(1) of the Convention specifically contemplates a “working relationship” between the Commission and the FAO. To that end, in 1973, ICCAT and the FAO entered into an agreement to “ensure cooperation . . . by consultation, coordination of effort, mutual assistance and joint action in fields of common interest.” Pursuant to that agreement, ICCAT is entitled to send observers to sessions of the FAO Committee on Fisheries and its subsidiary bodies, to sessions of the FAO Conference and Council and other meetings of the FAO which deal with matters relating to the conservation and management of the living resources of the sea. In turn, the FAO is entitled to send representatives to all meetings of ICCAT and its subsidiary bodies. The agreement further endorses the “fullest exchange of information and documents concerning matters of common interest,” close and regular cooperation and consultation, and, where possible, arrangements for joint action between ICCAT and the FAO. The Convention also explicitly endorses cooperation between the Commission and other international fisheries commissions and relevant scientific organizations, and authorizes the Commission to enter into agreements with such organizations. It also authorizes the Commission to invite any appropriate international organization or any government that is a member of the UN or any of the UN’s specialized agencies to send observers to meetings of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies. Such observers may address the meeting and otherwise participate in its work, but may not vote.
Decision Making:

ICCAT decisions are taken by a majority of the members of the Commission, except as provided by Article VIII(1)(b) of the Convention, with each Contracting Party entitled to one vote. Article VIII(1)(b)(i) of the Convention provides that recommendations must be made with the approval of at least two-thirds of all of Contracting Parties when they are made upon the initiative of the Commission when there is already an appropriate Panel in place. Otherwise, Article VIII(1)(b) authorizes recommendations to be made based upon the proposal of the relevant Panel(s) or upon Commission initiative when there is no appropriate panel in place. ICCAT recommendations become effective for all Contracting Parties six months after notification by the Commission, subject to the provisions of Article VIII(3). Pursuant to that article, any Contracting Party member of a Panel (or, in the case of recommendations made on the initiative of the Commission, any Contracting Party) may object to a recommendation within the six-month notification period; should such an objection be made, the recommendation will not become effective for a further sixty days. Once an objection is made, any other Contracting Party may likewise object, either within the sixty-day period or within forty-five days of the last objection, whichever is later. The recommendation in question will then become effective upon the expiration of the extended period(s) for objection, except for those Contracting Parties that have objected.

In the event that less than one-fourth of the Contracting Parties object, those Contracting Parties will be provided with a further sixty-day period to reaffirm their objections; upon the expiration of that further period, the recommendation shall become effective, except with respect to those Contracting Parties who reaffirm their objections.

In the event that more than one-fourth but less than a majority of the Contracting Parties object, the recommendation shall become effective, except with respect to those Contracting Parties who have objected.

If a majority of Contracting Parties object, therecommendation does not become effective.

Any Contracting Party may withdraw an objection to a recommendation at any time. The recommendation will then become effective with respect to that Contracting Party if it is already in effect, or at such time as it becomes effective pursuant to the terms of Article VIII. The Commission will notify the Contracting Parties upon receipt of each objection (as well as any withdrawals) and the entry into force of any recommendation.

Under Rule 9(8) of the Procedural Rules, in “cases of special necessity, where a decision cannot be deferred until the next meeting of the Commission,” a matter may be decided between regular meetings by intersessional vote (either electronically or via other means of written communication).
Dispute Resolution:

The Convention does not discuss dispute resolution. But, the Seat Agreement between ICCAT and Spain does include provisions concerning the settlement of differences. Under Article 25 of the Seat Agreement, ICCAT, in cooperation with the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, agreed to take measures to provide for the suitable settlement of disputes involving ICCAT officials who enjoy immunity. In addition, under Article 26 of the Seat Agreement, conflicts concerning the application of the Seat Agreement, which cannot be resolved by negotiations, will be submitted to a three-person arbitral panel for final settlement.
Data Information Sharing, Exchange, and Harmonization:

Every two years, ICCAT submits a report on its work and findings, which is transmitted by the Executive Secretary to all Contracting Parties of the Commission, the FAO and any government or international organization invited to send observers to the meeting. The Council, Panels and other subsidiary bodies of ICCAT also adopt reports at the end of each meeting, which are then submitted to the appropriate parent body. Generally speaking, ICCAT collects two main types of data. Fishery independent data includes research vessel surveys and other studies, such as those conducted with tagging programs. But, ICCAT generally relies on fishery-dependent data sources, such as logbooks, observer programs, port sampling, factory/market sampling and international trade (import/export) statistics.

ICCAT also maintains a number of statistical databases, which contain data on fleet characterization (number and type of fishing vessels); nominal catch (by species, region, gear, flag); catch and effort (fishing fleet, time, gear and time and area strata); and fish size (size samples and catch-at-size estimates).
Notifications:

See Data Information Sharing, Exchange, and Harmonization.
Funding and Financing:

The Commission is charged with adopting a budget for the two years that follow each regular meeting. The Council reviews the second half of the biennial budget at its regular meeting between Commission meetings, and may reapportion amounts in the budget for the second year within the total budget approved by the Commission. In accounting for the expenditures of the Commission, the Financial Regulations authorize the establishment of a General Fund, a Working Capital Fund and such trust funds as are necessary. The total budget for 2009 was 2,714,756 euros. Each Contracting Party is obligated to contribute annually to the ICCAT budget, in an amount calculated according to a scheme provided for in the Financial Regulations, as modified by the Madrid Protocol. Individual appropriations are determined in part by “each Contracting Party’s fixed basic fees for Commission and Panel membership” and in part by taking into account “the total round weight of catch
