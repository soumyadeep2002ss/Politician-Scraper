The Strategy Workshop for #NATO Exercise STEADFAST DETERRENCE 2024 was held at the Joint Warfare Centre (JWC). The three-day event marks the first step in the exercise content development for STEADFAST DETERRENCE 2024 ‚Äì NATO‚Äôs first major joint exercise for the Allied Reaction Force (ARF), which will replace the NATO Response Force (NRF) in July this year under the lead of NATO Rapid Deployable Corps - Italy (NRDC-ITA).

Sponsored and coordinated by Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) and directed by the JWC, STEADFAST DETERRENCE 2024 will focus on NATO‚Äôs pre-Article 5 deterrence posture aimed at preventing conflicts and being prepared to defend. 

The exercise is the culmination of a series of training events undertaken by NRDC-ITA in preparation for their ARF role, which underscores increased #warfighting readiness across the Alliance.

The transformation of the NRF to the new requirements of the ARF, within the framework of the Concept for Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area (DDA), is a reflection of the new security realities described in NATO‚Äôs Strategic Concept 2022.

The JWC-directed exercise will support the implementation of DDA, future multi-domain operations, and NATO‚Äôs warfighting transformation, bringing forth a revolutionary change in the way NATO plans for and conducts exercises to meet the complex strategic and operational challenges facing the Alliance.

Major General Piotr Malinowski, Commander JWC, in his opening remarks said: ‚ÄúIn today‚Äôs complex international security environment NATO, perhaps more than ever in recent history, needs to maintain credible and scalable deterrence forces that are ready to defend every inch of NATO‚Äôs territory at the speed of relevance.‚Äù

More than 120 military and civilian personnel from across the Alliance and Sweden participated in the workshop. The next big step in the exercise planning process is the Incident Development Workshop scheduled to take place in March.

Last week, a small team of medical professionals came together in Stavanger to help develop & test concepts for a medical operations #wargame as part of the planning process for Exercise STEADFAST FOXTROT 2024. 

Directed by the Joint Warfare Centre (JWC), STEADFAST FOXTROT is #NATO‚Äôs premier enablement and sustainment wargaming exercise, which kicked off last November. Lt. Col. Neddersen, the JWC‚Äôs Wargaming Branch Chief, explained that sometimes, high-quality wargaming can be utilized as a low-cost alternative tool to help think through some of the most complex operational challenges facing the Alliance. 

‚ÄúThe integration of medical operations wargaming into STEADFAST FOXTROT 2024 demonstrates a commitment to go beyond logistics alone and provide quality training to the entire NATO sustainment community," Neddersen explained.

"Setting up hospitals and supply chains in real life for training is a resource-intensive prospect in terms of time, money, and people. Wargaming offers a more economical approach to depict these operations at a theatre scale to help leaders and their staffs visualize challenges and develop solutions that can be tested repeatedly."

Since becoming fully operational in 2022, the JWC‚Äôs Wargaming Branch has developed more than 15 wargames for NATO that are low-cost, yet still have a high impact for training value at any echelon.
