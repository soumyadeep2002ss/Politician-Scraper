Jerez de la Frontera is a city in the province of Cádiz, in the region of Andalusia in Spain. It is famous as the home of the wine called sherry, whose name comes from the city's old Arabic name, pronounced Sherish.

Jerez de la Frontera, once called Xeres, has a rich history from the days of the Moorish Arab occupation of the Iberian Peninsula. Part of its name, de la Frontera, means "of the frontier" because it was on the border between Islamic and Christian populations.

The city is well known for breeding and training the world-famous Andalusian horses. Flamenco dance is a popular cultural feature of the city.
