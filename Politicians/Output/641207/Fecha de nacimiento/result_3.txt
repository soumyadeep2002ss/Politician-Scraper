Book of summaries XV National Meeting of Quaternary
Alejandro Cearreta

2019, Cearreta, A. (ed.), Book of summaries XV National Meeting of Quaternary, SC Aranzadi-UPV/EHU, ISBN 978-84-17713-16-4

Between July 1-5, 2019, the XV National Meeting of Quaternary was held in Bilbao. This Congress of the Spanish Association for the Study of the Quaternary (AEQUA) has been organized locally by the Training and Research Unit in the UPV/EHU. The Basque Country presents a long Quaternarist tradition, within whose main milestones it is possible The Aranzadi Science Society for the investigation of the natural environment and cultural heritage, the celebration in 1990 of the first scientific meeting in Vitoria-Gasteiz under the title of International Conference on the Environment and the Human Society in the Western Pyrenees and the Basque Mountains During the Upper Pleistocene and the Holocene and, finally, the beginning in 2009 of the postgraduate university studies in quaternary: environmental changes and human footprint at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU (Master and Doctorate).

West of Sella. Geoarcheology and CronostratigraaFía of the Higher Pleistocene Registry of the Cueva de El Cierro (Fresnu, Ribadsella, Asturias, Spain)

Jesús F. Jordá, David Álvarez-Alonso, Pablo Arias, Miriam Cubas, Rodrigo Portero Hernández

ABSTRACT The cave of El Cierro (Fresno, Ribadsella, Asturias) is a karst cavity located on the west margin of the Sella River and developed in the carboniferous limestones of the Asturian massif of the Cantabrian mountain range (north of the Iberian Peninsula), which contains an important Sedimentary, archaeological and paleontological record of the upper and lower Holocene Pleistocene, with abundant technological evidence and faunistic remains. The archaeological record starts with a level that could correspond to the final Paleolithic, continues with a complete sequence of the upper paleolithic of which there is a level of the lower magdalenian Clare-relaxed and dated, and ends with levels dated at the end of the Upper/Aziliense Paleolithic and in the mesolithic that configure a conceher. The stratigraphic sequence consists of fourteen levels grouped into two lithostratigraphic units with very different sedimentary characteristics, a lower, siliciclastic and another biogenic superior formed by the accumulation of shells and bones of anthropic contribution, which are studied with geoarcheological methodology. This work analyzes the lithostratigraphic sequence and the data of the granulometric, mineralogical, Edaphological and radiometric analysis are presented. The result of these analyzes allows to precisely interpret both the lithostratigraphy of the deposit and the sedimentary and diagenic pro-devices responsible for their formation and subsequent evolution. The available radiocarbon datations allow to place the upper levels of the siliciclastic sequence in the GS 2B and the lower conhero in the GI 1 and the GS 1 (recent dryas), at the end of the Pleistocene SuperiOr, while the upper con-chaler would be located in the chronozone boreal at the beginning of the Holocene. Keywords: Karst, northern Iberia, upper pleistocene, sedimentary processes, radiocarbon.

West of Sella. Geoarcheology and chronostratigraphy of the registration of the upper pleistocene of the cave of El Cierro (Fresno, Ribadsella, Asturias, Spain)

Esteban Álvarez-Fernández

The Cierro Cave (Fresno, Ribadsella, Asturias) is a Karst Cavity Located in the West Bank of the Sella River and Developed in the Carboniferous Limestone of the Asturian Massif of the Cantabrian Range (Northern Iberian Peninsula). This cave contaors an important sedimentary, archaeological and palaeontological record of the upper pleistocene and early holocene with abundant Technological Remains (Lithic and Bone Industries) and Bone Rema Rema of Mammals and Others Vertebrates. THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD STARTS WITH A PROBALY MIDDLE PALAEOLITHIC LEVEL, FOLLOWED BY A COMPLETE SEQUENCE OF THE UPPER PALEOLITHIC, WITH LOWER MAGDALENIAN LEVEL CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AND DATED, AND ENDS WITH LEVEL OFthe Late Upper Magdalenian/Azilian and the Mesolithic forming three shell middens. The stratigraphic sequence consists of fourteen levels grouped in two litostratigraphic units with very different sedimentary characteristics studied by geoarchaeological methods. The lower unit is characterized by the significant presence of siliceous sands and silts while the upper unit is formed by three anthropic shell middens cemented by carbonates. This paper analyzes the lithostratigraphic sequence and shows the results of the granulometric, mineralogical, edaphic and radiometric analysis. These results allows us to interpret precisely the lithostratigraphy of the deposits and the sedimentary and diagenetic processes responsible for their formation and evolution. In addition, the radiocarbon dates obtained allow us to place the upper levels of the clastic sequence in the GS 2b and the lower shell midden in GI 1 and GS 1 at the end of the Upper Pleistocene, while the upper shell midden would be located in the Boreal cronozona in the Early Holocene. Key words: karst, northern Iberia, radiocarbon, sedimentary processes, Upper Pleistocene.

Una aproximación geoarqueológica al hábitat humano pleistoceno del occidente cantábrico (Asturias, norte de España)

David Álvarez-Alonso, Maria-Jose Iriarte-Chiapusso, Jesús F. Jordá

The objective of this paper is focused on showing the geological and geomorphological characteristics of western Cantabrian region and its main geomorphological, geoarchaeological and palaeoambiental issues, related with the human activities developed in this place during the Pleistocene. All this aspects have conditioned as the human habitat characteristics along Palaeolithic times, as well as the different adaptations which the human groups had to carry out for developing their ways of life and for assuring their survival.

Límites cronológicos de la presencia humana durante el Pleistoceno medio en la cuenca baja del. Río Miño (Pontevedra, España) / Chronological constraints for Middle Pleistocene human occupations in the Lower Miño basin (Pontevedra, Spain)

2019 •

Eduardo Méndez-Quintas

The geomorphological, geochronological and archaeological investigations developed over the recent years in the lower Miño basin have led to the identification of 9 levels of fluvial terrace and other sedimentary deposits. The sedimentary features indicate stable river patterns over time, which are dominated by a braided gravel model. The earliest human presence in the area has been documented in the intermediate terrace deposits (elevations + 30-39 m and + 21-29 m). They include several archaeological sites characterized by large flake Acheulian lithic assemblages, whose age range between MIS 9 and 6. Finally, additional Middle Palaeolithic sites have also been identified within the terrace deposits +13-17 m, whose inferred age would most likely be between MIS 5 and 4.

Las condiciones ambientales durante la transición del Paleolítico Medio al Superior en la Cornisa Cantábrica: del 40.000 al 30.000 en la Cueva del Conde (Tuñón, Asturias, España)

Jesús Fernández Fernández

The Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition in the Iberian Peninsula is identified by the climatic change of the Würm II to III (approx. 32,000-28,000 yr BP, uncalibrated), when the climate change from a warm period withthe cold stages, during the Cro-Magnons arrival. In Conde Cave (Tuñón, Asturias), these palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions are now study. The fauna and the pollen of the both periods show warm climate conditions and the cave sediments could have been formed in a cold stage (<36,000 yr BP), with a settlement during a warm climate which could have been colder during the Aurignacian tecno-complex (34,000 to 32,000 yr BP).

Estudio Geoarqueológico preliminar de las Terrazas fluviales del Río Trubia en el entorno de la Cueva del Conde (Tuñón, Asturias, Noroeste de España)

Jesús Fernández Fernández

Some of the first results of the geoarchaeological research developed in the Trubia river, in the surroundings of the Conde Cave (Tuñón, Sto Adriano, Asturias NW Spain), are presented in this work. Seven fluvial terrace levels: +115, +80, +50-60, +40, +30, +5-6, and +2-3 m, were identified by using field work and geomophological mapping. Two prehistoric sites were found, showing a spatial distribution linked to the 30 m level. The lithic industry belongs to the technical Mode 2, dated in Asturias between 130,000-70,000 yr BP. This information could provide a chronological reference for the 30 m level.
