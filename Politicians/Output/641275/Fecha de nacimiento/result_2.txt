The0Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico recalled that social protection was
not an abstract concept, but was linked to the guarantees enshrined in countries’ legal foundations and in
the international agreements to which they were parties. Emphasizing the need to develop socio-economic
policies which would help to solve the real problems of the States of the region in important areas such as
those dealt with in the document, he stressed the importance of cooperation and the strengthening of
democratic institutions. He also referred to increased involvement by the associate members of the
Commission. This was proof of support for the secretariat and of the confidence of member Status, and he
called on them to play an active part in the work of the Commission in order to design strategies which
would lead to sustained and equitable development.
20.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uruguay said that the agenda items for the session were
among the most important issues on the international agenda in an increasingly interrelated and
interdependent world. His Government was convinced of the need to promote dialogue and multilateral
cooperation in Latin America and the Caribbean, in order to expand the region’s scant social protection
coverage and cut its high poverty rates, which were all the more scandalous in light of the abundance of
natural resources in the region. He requested the Commission to continue its in-depth analysis of the
situation in the region; it was necessary to understand it fully in order to change it.
Opening of the thirty-first session of the Commission
21.
At the opening of the session, statements were made by José Luis Machinea, Executive Secretary
of the Commission, and Tabaré Vázquez, President of Uruguay.
22.
The Executive Secretary of the Commission recalled that since the 1990s, it had been formulating
a new development framework for the countries of the region to enable them to successfully achieve
global integration, combining growth with increasing social equity. The Commission’s current proposal
emphasized the need to boost competitiveness, ensure macroeconomic stability and build participatory
and inclusive democracy.
23.
Improvements in social protection were linked to the achievement of high and sustained growth
rates through the promotion of greater and better-quality global integration and the creation of favourable
macroeconomic conditions. He emphasized the importance of reaching broad social agreements and
revaluing the role of the State in dealing with such issues. Just as improved economic institutions had
been built in the 1990s, efforts must be made during the current decade to construct a stronger and more
effective institutionality for society.
24.
The President of Uruguay said that he shared the Executive Secretary’s view of the situation of
the region. He considered that the outlook was positive, but it was for Governments to take the measures
needed to alleviate the remaining problems.
25.
The proposed agenda for the session would entail considerable efforts. He welcomed the fact that
the document prepared by ECLAC was dedicated to social protection, which was a crucial dimension of
development. If the development strategies which were applied failed to take into account the people’s
quality of life, rights and aspirations, they might lead to growth but not to true development. As a starting

5

point towards overcoming the situation of inequality prevailing in the region, ECLAC should take a step
further by believing that, despite difficulties and limitations, things could be changed.
Visit of Michelle Bachelet, President of the Republic of Chile

Bachelet%2C%20President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Chile%2C%0Apaid%20a%20special%20visit%20to%20the%20session%20and%20addressed%20the%20participants.%20She%20said%20that%20it%20was%20her%20first%20opportunity%0Ato%20take%20part%20in%20a%20multilateral%20meeting%20as%20President%20of%20Chile%2C%20and%20it%20was%20a%20privilege%20to%20do%20so%20at%20the%20session%20of%0AECLAC.%20Describing%20the%20main%20points%20of%20her%20Government%E2%80%99s%20social%20policies%2C%20she%20drew%20attention%20to%20the%20reform%0Aof%20the%20pensions%20system%20and%20the%20intensification%20of%20health-care%20reform%3B%20changes%20in%20pre-school%20education%20and%0Athe%20first%20four%20years%20of%20primary%20school%3B%20job%20creation%20in%20a%20framework%20of%20decent%20employment%3B%20plans%20for%0Aovercoming%20hard-core%20poverty%3B%20and%20an%20equal-opportunities%20plan.%0AReport%20on%20the%20activities%20of%20the%20Commission%20since%20the%20thirtieth%20session%20(agenda%20item%203)%0A27.%0AThe%20secretariat%20submitted%20for%20consideration%20by%20delegations%20a%20report%20on%20the%20activities%20conducted%20in%0Athe%20framework%20of%20the%20programme%20of%20work%20of%20the%20ECLAC%20system%20in%20the%20two%20years%20since%20the%20previous%0Asession%20of%20the%20Commission.%20In%20addition%20to%20the%20preparation%20of%20periodic%20reports%20on%20the%20situation%20in%20the%20region%2C%0Athe%20central%20aspects%20of%20the%20Commission%E2%80%99s%20work%20had%20included%20the%20publication%20of%20the%20document%20entitled%20The%0AMillennium%20Development%20Goals%3A%20A%20Latin%20American%20and%20Caribbean%20Perspective%20%E2%80%94the%20product%20of%0Aunprecedented%20cooperation%20among%20the%2011%20United%20Nations%20specialized%20agencies%2C%20funds%20and%20programmes%0Arepresented%20in%20the%20region%E2%80%94%20as%20well%20as%20follow-up%20to%20international%20conferences%20on%20economic%20and%20social%0Aissues%2C%20meetings%20of%20the%20Commission%E2%80%99s%20subsidiary%20bodies%2C%20and%20inter-agency%20activities.%20The%20secretariat%20then%0Asummarized%20the%20results%20achieved%20in%20terms%20of%20training%20activities%2C%20cooperation%20programmes%20and%20projects%2C%0Atechnical%20cooperation%20missions%2C%20and%20the%20distribution%20of%20documents%20and%20databases%2C%20mostly%20on%20the%20Internet.%0A28.%0AThe%20Directors%20of%20the%20subregional%20headquarters%20in%20Mexico%20and%20in%20the%20Caribbean%20reported%20on%20the%0Aactivities%20conducted%20during%20the%20biennium.%20They%20emphasized%20ECLAC%E2%80%99s%20work%20in%20the%20assessment%20of%20damage%0Acaused%20by%20natural%20disasters%20to%20enable%20the%20countries%20affected%20to%20obtain%20the%20financing%20they%20needed%20in%20order%20to%0Arecover%20from%20their%20impacts%3B%20those%20efforts%20also%20involved%20the%20United%20Nations%20Children%E2%80%99s%20Fund%20and%20the%20World%0AFood%20Programme.%20The%20Executive%20Secretary%20stressed%20the%20efforts%20that%20ECLAC%20had%20made%20to%20assist%20Haiti%2C%20and%0Adrew%20attention%20to%20repeated%20requests%20by%20the%20Government%20of%20Haiti%20for%20the%20Commission%20to%20produce%20integrated%0Adevelopment%20plans%20for%20that%20country.%0A29.%0AThe%20following%20speakers%20included%20the%20chairpersons%20of%20the%20Executive%20Committee%20of%20the%20Statistical%0AConference%20of%20the%20Americas%2C%20the%20Regional%20Conference%20on%20Women%20in%20Latin%20America%20and%20the%20Caribbean%2C%0Athe%20Caribbean%20Development%20and%20Cooperation%20Committee%20and%20the%20Presiding%20Officers%20of%20the%20Regional%0ACouncil%20for%20Planning%20of%20the%20Latin%20American%20and%20Caribbean%20Institute%20for%20Economic%20and%20Social%20Planning%2C%0Asubsidiary%20bodies%20which%20referred%20their%20decisions%20to%20the%20plenary%20session.%20The%20speakers%20referred%20to%20the%0Aconclusions%20and%20outcomes%20of%20discussions%20held%20during%20their%20meetings%2C%20and%20to%20the%20subject%20of%20social%0Aprotection%2C%20from%20the%20viewpoints%20of%20their%20respective%20mandates.%0A30.%0AOne%20delegation%20drew%20attention%20to%20the%20breadth%20of%20the%20issues%20to%20be%20discussed%2C%20which%20covered%20almost%0Aall%20the%20problems%20of%20Latin%20America%20and%20the%20Caribbean%2C%20to%20ECLAC%E2%80%99s%20faithful%20implementation%20of%20the%20mandate%0Aset%20out%20by%20its%20member%20countries%2C%20and%20to%20the%20high%20quality%20of%20the%20Commission%E2%80%99s%20work.%0A%0A%0C6%0A%0ADraft%20programme%20of%20work%20of%20the%20ECLAC%20system%2C%202008-2009%20(agenda%20item%204)%0A31.%0AThe%20Executive%20Secretary%20of%20ECLAC%20submitted%20for%20consideration%20by%20the%20plenary%20meeting%20the%20draft%0Aprogramme%20of%20work%20of%20the%20ECLAC%20system%20for%20the%20biennium%202008-2009.%0A32.%0AIn%20preparing%20the%20draft%2C%20the%20Commission%20had%20conducted%20a%20regional%20analysis%20of%20the%20main%20economic%2C%0Asocial%20and%20environmental%20sustainability%20issues.%20He%20was%20cautiously optimistic concerning the overall
picture, in an international environment which was favourable but involved risks and challenges.
33.
He then referred to the seven thematic priorities of the Commission, which included the
attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium
Declaration, and to tasks relating to their achievement in the region. He also described the programme of
work of the ECLAC system and summarized the agenda to be followed in the economic, social and
sustainable development fields, as well as training, statistical and technical cooperation activities at the
regional and subregional levels.
34.
Several delegations expressed their approval of the draft, and a number of speakers recommended
that a resolution should be adopted to renew the mandate of the United Nations in Haiti.
35.
In relation to subprogramme 1, Linkages with the global economy, integration and regional
cooperation, and in response to a question from one delegation concerning the impact of technological
progress in terms of competitiveness and production chains, the Director of the Division of International
Trade and Integration said that work was in progress, jointly with the Division of Production, Productivity
and Management of ECLAC, to update competitiveness indicators.
36.
In relation to subprogramme 2, Production and innovation, several delegations referred to the
need to improve access to capital markets for small and medium-sized enterprises. The Director of the
Division of Production, Productivity and Management replied that that issue was mentioned in the
programme of work of ECLAC and that studies were being conducted on the subject.
37.
In the context of subprogramme 4, Equity and social cohesion, a number of delegations called for
the mainstreaming of the issue of disability, with a cross-cutting approach, in the activities of the
Commission. The secretariat welcomed the proposal and suggested that activities should be conducted in
the statistical field and that a prospective study should be prepared, the results of which would be
announced before the following session. Responding to a proposal that the concept of the family as the
basic unit of society should be included in the consideration of issues of social cohesion, the Officer-incharge of the Social Development Division said that the concept of the family was always present in the
work of the Commission, and that the subject would be dealt with in the next edition of the Social
Panorama of Latin America.
38.
Some delegations emphasized the need to strengthen gender mainstreaming (subprogramme 5,
Mainstreaming the gender perspective into the regional development process). It was requested that the
expression “gender obstacles” in that subprogramme should be understood as “obstacles to gender
equality”, a point which was accepted by the secretariat.
39.
Concerning subprogramme 8, Sustainable development and human settlements, one delegation
suggested that ECLAC’s concept of “markets of environmental goods and services” contained in that
subprogramme should be understood as “appropriate markets in areas such as climate change and those

7

relating to biodiversity.” It was further proposed that a seminar should be held on the situation of those
markets. Both proposals were accepted by the secretariat.
40.
Another interest shared by a number of delegations was consideration of the issue of sustainable
use of energy resources and the incorporation of renewable energies in energy matrices (subprogramme 9,
Natural resources and infrastructure).
41.
Concerning subregional activities in the Caribbean (subprogramme 12), several delegations
emphasized the need to strengthensynergy with the other countries of the region, particularly concerning
matters relating to subject area 8.2 of the corresponding subprogramme. It was further agreed that the
expression “rare window” mentioned in that subprogramme referred, not to the unusual nature of the
communication and cooperation links between the independent States of the Caribbean and the non-selfgoverning territories which are associate members of ECLAC and of the Caribbean Development and
Cooperation Committee (CDCC), but to the exceptionally positive aspects of those links.
Proposed calendar of conferences of ECLAC for the period 2006-2008 (agenda item 5)
42.
The Executive Secretary submitted the proposed calendar of conferences of ECLAC for the
period 2006-2008 for consideration by delegations, and it was approved as contained in the annex to the
corresponding resolution.
ECLAC sessional Ad Hoc Committee on Population and Development (agenda item 6)
43.
The report of the ECLAC sessional Ad Hoc Committee on Population and Development appears
in annex 1 to this report.
Consideration of the request of the Government of Japan for admission as a member of the Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) (agenda item 7)
44.
Following the reading of the note from the Government of Japan requesting its admission as a
member of the Commission, a draft resolution was introduced welcoming that country’s request and
recommending to the Economic and Social Council that its admission should be approved. The
delegations of a number of countries then made statements giving their express support to the request.
45.

The draft resolution was adopted by acclamation.2

46.
The representative of Japan said that since 1956, as an observer country, Japan had maintained
close relations with ECLAC, and described the economic and technical cooperation, both regional and
bilateral, provided by Japan in the region. He recalled that Japan and the countries of Latin America and
the Caribbean shared fundamental values such as democracy and economic liberalization, which would
enable them to be important trade and investment partners within the international community.

Consideration of the request of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland for admission of the Turks and Caicos Islands as an associate member of the Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) (agenda item 8)
47.
After a reading of the note sent by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland requesting the admission of Turks and Caicos Islands as an associate member of the
Commission, a draft resolution was presented welcoming the request and it was decided to admit Turks
and Caicos Islands in that capacity. The delegations of a number of countries then made statements
expressly supporting the admission of the new associate member.
48.

The resolution was adopted by acclamation.3

49.
The representative of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland recalled the Turks and Caicos Islands’ strong economic, cultural and social links with the region
and relayed his Government’s commitment to strengthening those links as far as possible. He highlighted
the fact that the admission of Turks and Caicos Islands as an associate member of the Commission
contributed greatly to fulfilling this objective.
Committee on South-South Cooperation (agenda item 9)
50.

The report of the Committee on South-South Cooperation is attached as annex 2.

Presentation and analysis of the document entitled Shaping the Future of Social Protection: Access,
Financing and Solidarity (agenda item 10)
51.
The Executive Secretary of ECLAC presented the document entitled Shaping the Future of Social
Protection: Access, Financing and Solidarity. José Antonio Ocampo, Under-Secretary-General for
Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations, and Rebeca Grynspan, Assistant Administrator and
Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean of the United Nations Development Programme,
commented on the document.
52.
In presenting the document, the Executive Secretary of ECLAC said that the income inequality
observed in Latin America and the Caribbean was reflected in its social protection systems. In a context
of increasingly precarious employment conditions, the reforms of the 1990s ––which had been intended
to strengthen the link between formal work and protection on the basis of incentive mechanisms and
efficiency gains–– had failed to improve those systems’ low levels of coverage, and solidarity had been
reduced, in most cases, to the welfare aspect. This situation, already marked by great regional and
national heterogeneity, was compounded by new pressures resulting from demographic, epidemiological
and technological changes, as well as changes in household structure.
53.
The issue must therefore be approached from a new perspective based on the universalization of
social protection. This could not be achieved on the basis of employment as the sole mechanism of
access. Instead, it was necessary to define explicit, guaranteed and enforceable rights, increase the
complementarity of incentives and solidarity, integrate the contributory and non-contributory components
and improve institutional structures and the quality of services. Poverty reduction programmes not only
constituted a network of support for the most vulnerable, but should also facilitate human capitalbuilding, with a view to ending the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Reforms should be
3

See resolution 628(XXXI).

9

conducted in the context of a social covenant, whose normative framework consisted of the rights of the
individual and in which economic inequalities were treated as surmountable.
54.
The Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations said that the
document picked up on the close relationship between the concepts of rights and citizenship, typical of
more integrated societies, in which economic development and equitable income distribution were
strongly linked. He then offered a number of reflections on the fundamental notions of universality,
solidarity, efficiency and integrality that underpinned the document, and emphasized the benefits of
shifting the analysis of system efficiency from the terrain of microeconomics used in the 1990s ––in
which it was taken for granted that free consumer choice would automatically lead to efficiency gains––
to a simpler level, looking at the relationship between public spending and real outcomes in terms of
coverage, morbidity and mortality, and meeting the needs of the population.
55.
An innovative feature of the study was that the approach advocated was not held up as an
alternative to universalization, but as a means to achieve it. In concluding, the speaker suggested that
unemployment insurance and employment programmes should be among the issues to be considered, that
efforts should be made to avoid new forms of segmentation leading to separate systems for rich and poor,
and that gender equity should be strengthened. Also, it was particularly important to take into account the
current situation of pension systems in each country in devising future reforms.
56.
The Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean of the
United Nations Development Programme said that, despite the strongly homogenizing discourse
employed in the region in the 1980s and 1990s, a large variety of schemes and policies on social
protection still existed, and the report’s compilation of these had been valuable in itself. She agreed with
the previous speakers that unequal income distribution and social protection gaps had the effect of
sharpening business cycles, such that economic recovery translated only slowly into social recovery and
poverty that had been circumstantial very often became structural.
57.
She also concurred on the need for a change of approach, in the framework of a rights-based
construct, and the need to remove the link between access to social protection and the labour market, a
link which was leaving the large sector of informal workers out of the system. It was also necessary to
combine contributory and non-contributory funding and tighten the link between contributions and
benefits. With regard to this last point, as matters of urgency, proper incentives were needed to keep
individuals with greater contributory capacity in the system, which, in turn, had to be reformed to offer
quality services and coverage for conditions that were very costly to treat. The new targeted programmes
differed from the previous schemes in their aim to cover the entire population, which ruled out the
possibility of clientelism, while posing challenges of scale. These challenges were being successfully
addressed and their real outcomes would depend on the creation of employment opportunities to
capitalize on the programmes’ built-in investments in human capital. These objectives were all the more
important given that, unless unequal societies evolved into more equitable ones, it could be difficult to
sustain one of the great achievements of the last 25 years: democratic systems of government.
58.
In their statements, delegations highlighted the importance of the rights-based approach adopted
in the document and emphasized the need for coordination of initiatives among countries and
international agencies and within countries. Particular importance was attributed to democracy and the
voice of civil society, as well as to the gender question, as essential elements in the satisfactory
implementation of social security programmes. One delegation suggested that greater attention be
afforded to the issue of employment, which provided individuals with a living and personal fulfilment and
took advantage of the region’s human resources potential; another emphasized the need for fiscal reform

10

to tax those with higher incomes more heavily. With respect to financing, it was suggested that social
policy design itself could help to bring about an improvement.
59.
A number of delegations focused on the social security programmes being implemented in the
countries, raising ideas and queries regarding recommendations contained in the document and points
raised by other speakers. Reference was made to the process of broadening the coverage of these
programmes and the constraints imposed in some cases by the lack of minimum infrastructure. Mention
was also made of possibilities of institutionalization, coordination with other programmes and sectors, the
feasibility of decentralization, and implications in terms of management and costs. One participant also
brought up the importance of systems to monitor programmes and evaluate their outcomes, as well as
information and communications systems to broadcast the existence of programmes and their results.
High-level seminar “Shaping the Future of Social Protection: Access, Financing and Solidarity”
60.
The document Shaping the Future of Social Protection: Access, Financing and Solidarity was
analysed at length by four panels, devoted to the following subjects: social protection coverage andrights;
health service financing and delivery; pension system reform; and social programmes, human capital and
inclusion.
61.
The first panel, moderated by Ernesto Ottone, acting Deputy Executive Secretary of the
Commission, analysed the low coverage of contributions, the region’s slow growth and unfavourable
labour dynamics, and the difficulties, low quality and poor coverage involved in non-contributory
systems. Several participants insisted that higher social spending called for increased financing, but that
this should not be allowed to undermine the economies’ competitiveness. The panellists considered the
need for social policy to be guided by the rights-based perspective and to ensure that employment was not
the sole means of accessing social protection. They also underlined the need for a new social contract or
covenant setting out explicit, guaranteed and enforceable rights, establishing levels and sources of
financing and taking account of the need to develop a social institutional fabric.
62.
The speakers on the second panel, moderated by María Julia Muñoz, Minister of Public Health of
Uruguay, discussed the universalization of social protection and the need to acknowledge the sharp
inequalities in service access and quality, the lack of integration between the public and private sectors of
social security, and the existence of a demographic, epidemiological and technological transition process.
They also referred to the need to direct public health policies towards expanding primary care.
63.
On the third panel, moderated by Gabriel Castellá, Director General of the Ministry of Labour
and Social Security of Uruguay, the speakers emphasized the need to increase coverage by means of a
non-contributory component. The reform of contributory schemes should be conducted with regard for
contributory solidarity and financial viability, while the pension system reform agenda should consider
individual capitalization as a complementary element aimed at facilitating the unification of social
security regimes.
64.
The speakers on the fourth panel, moderated by Marina Arismendi, Minister of Social
Development of Uruguay, referred to employment-related emergency programmes and conditional
transfer schemes, which were afforded particular importance in the document. Several panellists also
highlighted the need to put in place employment programmes to strengthen beneficiary training and to
complement human capital building with the promotion of productive policies.

Closing meeting
65.
At the closing meeting of the thirty-first session of ECLAC, statements were made by José Luis
Machinea, Executive Secretary of the Commission; Reinaldo Gargagno, Minister of Foreign Affairs of
Uruguay; and Guarocuya Félix, representative of the Dominican Republic.
66.
The Executive Secretary of the Commission expressed his pleasure at the content and originality
of the document presented at the session and the proposals and strategies put forward therein, matching
the interest surrounding the subject of social protection in the region. He referred particularly to the high
level of the panels and thanked the countries, specialized agencies of the United Nations,
intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations represented for their support of the
Commission’s work.
67.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uruguay emphasized the quality of the Commission’s work
and of the analyses conducted during the session. He recalled that one of the tasks of the Commission was
to propose to the countries ideas for solving the problems it revealed, but that the implementation of the
solutions identified was the task of each Government.

Welcoming the entry into force of the United Nations Convention against Transnational
Organized Crime in 200311 and of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons,
Especially Women and Children in 200312 and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land,
Sea and Air in 2004,13 both of which supplement the Convention, and urging all countries to consider
ratifying or acceding to these instruments,
Acknowledging the entry into force of the International Convention on the Protection of the
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families in 200314 and observing with satisfaction the
continuous addition of further ratifications or accessions thereto,
Valuing the recent efforts and commitments made within the framework of the United Nations
system and of other intergovernmental organizations with respect to international migration and
development, as well as the consolidation of multilateral initiatives addressing these matters in Latin
America and the Caribbean, such as the Regional Conference on Migration and the South American
Conference on Migration,
Aware of the benefits that international migration may afford in terms of development, migrants
themselves, their families, their host societies, their societies of origin and the enhancement of gender
equity, as well as the asymmetries of benefits reaped by countries of origin and destination societies, with
the latter being favoured by this process, given such factors as the beneficial effects that skilled migration
has on their societies and economies,
Aware also that the great economic and social inequalities existing between and within countries,
the marginalization of some nations from the world economy and high poverty rates help to generate
large-scale migratory movements that increase the magnitude of the complex phenomenon of
international migration,
Recognizing that initiatives for improving the position of migrants should include measures
aimed at overcoming the poverty affecting millions of people in numerous countries and ensuring their
access to education, health, food, work and social protection in accordance with the legal framework of
each country,
Observing that many Latin Americans and Caribbeans and their families are faced with a situation
of vulnerability with regard to the exercise of their rights,
Concerned by the increase in the trafficking of persons in all its forms, in particular for purposes
of exploitation and sexual abuse and tourism,

Bearing in mind that the central theme of the thirty-ninth session of the Commission on
Population and Development will be international migration and development,15
1. Welcomes with satisfaction the report presented by the Latin American and Caribbean
Demographic Centre - Population Division of the Commission to the Ad Hoc Committee on Population
and Development at its meeting held during the thirty-first session of the Commission,16 and recommends
the publication of the material on which that report is based so that it will be available for the High-level
Dialogue on International Migration and Development that is to take place when the United Nations
General Assembly meets in September 2006;
2. Is gratified by the efforts of national Governments, specialized agencies, funds and
programmes of the United Nations and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to
highlight the benefits afforded by international migration in terms of the development of societies of
origin and of destination, and reiterates the need to recognize that respect for human rights of migrants
should be at the core of any initiative aimed at taking advantage of those benefits;
3. Urges the Governments that have not yet done so to consider the possibility of signing and
ratifying the legal instruments of the United Nations whose object is to promote and protect migrants’
human rights as a mechanism for full social integration, and also invites Governments that have signed
these instruments to ensure their full enforcement;
4. Calls upon Governments to define the trafficking of persons in any form as an offence, bearing
in mind the growing frequency of trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation and tourism, and to
condemn and sanction all those responsible for this wrongful act, while providing protection to victims
and making sure that the latter are not punished or prosecuted for entering or residing in the country
illicitly;17
5. Encourages Governments to consider the possibility of engaging in international dialogues on
migration and invites them to incorporate migration, particularly proposals for improving the situation of
migrant workers, in bilateral accords and regional agreements;
6. Calls upon United Nations specialized agencies, funds and programmes and upon other
international, intergovernmental, regional, subregional and national organizations to continue, within the
framework of their respective mandates, to concern themselves with international migration and
development while devoting special attention to the various aspects of migration, including the gender
perspective, cultural diversity and unrestricted respect for human rights;
7. Requests the Executive Secretary to form an inter-agency group to be in charge of follow-up to
issues relating to international migration and development in the region and of fostering coordination and
coherence among the activities carried out in this field by specialized agencies, funds and programmes of
the United Nations, the International Organization for Migration and other intergovernmental institutions;
8. Urges the Governments and international, intergovernmental and academic institutions to
redouble their efforts to improve information and knowledge about the multiple aspects of international

migration and notes that, in this context, the Commission should foster research on migration issues in
areas in which more detailed data are required and that in-depth studies are useful in the case of recent
Latin American migration to alternative destinations such as Japan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland and border regions within the continent and regarding the growing new wave of
migration to Latin America by Europeans who choose to live at least part of the year in the region, which
leads to new employment opportunities, investment and transport infrastructure;
9. Encourages States to further, in cooperation with international, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations, information campaigns designed to explain the opportunities, limitations and
rights entailed by migration so that migrants, particularly women migrants, may take informed decisions
and avoid human trafficking and the smuggling of migrants;
10. Reaffirms the need to adopt measures aimed at reducing the costs for migrants of sending
remittances and promoting safe means of transferring those funds and welcomes any progress in this
regard;
11. Requests that Governments and stakeholders promote international, bilateral and multilateral
agreements to ensure social protection for migrants and facilitate the transfer of pensions from one
country to another in order to ensure adequate living conditions for them when they return to their
countries of origin;
12. Urges States to incorporate the goal of family reunification into their laws in view of its
positive effects in terms of immigrants’ integration;
13. Welcomes commitments regarding international migration contained in the Declaration of
Salamanca, adopted at the fifteenth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government, and the
organization of an Ibero-American meeting on migration, to be held in July 2006 in Madrid, for their
follow-up, and asks the Executive Secretary of the Commission to inform the Ibero-American Secretariat
of the special interest of all its member countries in participating in that meeting and of the choice of

622(XXXI) CENTRAL AMERICAN ECONOMIC COOPERATION COMMITTEE

The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean,
Recalling that the Central American Economic Cooperation Committee was created as a
consultative organ of the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean by virtue of resolution 9(IV) of the Commission, approved on 16 June 1951, to promote the
integration of the Central American economies and to analyse and study the concrete proposals of
member States,
Bearing in mind that the Committee comprises Ministers of Economic Affairs of the States of the
Central American Isthmus (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama),
Recognizing the important and innovative contribution made by the Committee since its creation
to increasing cooperation and integration among the countries of the Central American Isthmus and to the
development of the subregion as a whole,
Recognizing also the advances in terms of Central American integration achieved over the years
during which the Committee met regularly, such as the General Treaty on Central American Economic
Integration, the Multilateral Treaty of Free Trade and Central American Economic Integration, the
Agreement on the Regime for Central American Integration Industries and the Standard Central American
Tariff Code, as well as the support provided for the creation of the Central American Bank for Economic
Integration and the Secretariat for Central American Economic Integration,
Bearing in mind the efforts made by the countries of the Central American Isthmus to increase
their economic competitiveness, including those aimed at diversifying their economies and carrying out
institutional reforms,
Bearing in mind also the marked decrease in flows of official development assistance, which has
coincided with a tendency to hinder access to certain export markets,
Observing that, in recent decades, there has been an intensification in cooperation relations
between member countries of the Committeeand their counterparts in the region, as demonstrated by the
many agreements concluded on various subjects within and among the respective groups of countries,
including interregional agreements and agreements between the secretariats of integration processes,
Taking note, in particular, of the profound transformations observed in the international
environment in recent decades as a result of the increasing globalization of economic relations, as well as
other fundamental changes in the environment in which the Committee operates at the regional level,
which affect its effectiveness in fulfilling its mandates,
Recognizing that the signing of the Dominican Republic -Central America- United States Free
Trade Agreement ushers in a new set of opportunities and challenges in terms of integration and
economic well-being,

30

Highlighting the cooperation that has been established among regional organizations, such as the
Central American Integration System and the Secretariat for Central American Economic Integration, and
between them and the secretariat of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean,
which reveals the complementarity of their activities and programmes of work, as well as the convergence
of social, political, economic and environmental interests among the countries of the region,
Considering the need to continue strengthening the Committee as a regional forum that can help
member States face the challenges posed by the current transformation of the international economic
environment through the conclusion of agreements for the application of cooperation policies and
programmes, including the sharing of experiences in areas that are crucial for their sustainable
development and coordination of their positions with a view to presenting a harmonized stance in other
regional, hemispheric and world forums and with third countries and groups of countries,
1. Affirms that the Central American Economic Cooperation Committee is especially qualified as
a forum for reflection and analysis of the economic and social problems of the subregion, which can
provide important inputs to reinforce the capacity of Governments in the general area of the design,
implementation, follow-up and assessment of public policy in general, and especially trade policy,
macroeconomic and microeconomic policy, social policy and environmental policy;
2. Requests the Executive Secretary to convene, by common accord with the member countries of
the Committee, the next meeting of the Central American Economic Cooperation Committee in
accordance with the proposed calendar of conferences of the Commission for the period 2006-2008.1

20services based on
traditional methods, and the establishment of more efficient disease-prevention
mechanisms through promotional campaigns and preventive or curative measures as part
of primary healthcare services;

(iv)

In the area of pensions, the necessary mechanisms for progressing in terms of coverage,
solidarity and financial viability; the on-going review of best practices to provide
universal coverage that guarantees a minimum income for all low-income older adults;
the review of notional account models with a view to modifying the parameters of payas-you-go systems; provision of the necessary incentives to encourage certain segments
of the population to pay contributions and reduce the practice of underreporting of
income, which results in lower contributions; the definition of methods for putting an end
to the various special pension regimes and standardizing pension systems to avoid
inequities and alleviate the systems’ financing requirements; the determination of
methods for improving systems in which funds are privately administered in order to
reduce the problems associated with the limitations faced by many workers in financing
their own benefits; the systems’ adaptation to the constant changes in family structures
and to the roles of the various family members; the definition of appropriate ways of
revising the use of life tables to avoid demographic- or gender-based discrimination;

(v)

With respect to the foregoing, it is important to assess the impact of reforms on gender
equity;

(vi)

Ways of complementing short-term programmes for alleviating poverty with the
elimination of its more structural causes; the necessary financing schemes for
implementing social programmes that can have a direct, countercyclical influence on
household income, thereby enabling household members to receive additional income in
economically difficult times;

(vii)

Best practices applied in social programmes, which include, inter alia, the provision of
conditional transfers in order to combine immediate relief for income shortfalls with the
reinforcement of new generations’ human capital; ways of fostering a supply of decent
jobs in a way that is compatible with sustained growth dynamics and active employment
and productive modernization policies;

(viii)

A social institutional structure and authority that will lend forcefulness and technical and
political viability to social programmes and the adoption of fiscal norms to ensure that
these programmes have the necessary resources, in particular through the establishment
of a social covenant among the various political, economic and social actors, as well as
the provision of sustained political support to ensure the continuity of the relevant
policies;

38

(ix)

Methods that could be used to ensure that public policies contribute to social cohesion by
fostering participation in employment and access for all to the resources, goods, services
and rights of society, as well as avoiding risks and problems of exclusion, assisting the
most vulnerable persons and mobilizing all the relevant organizations;

5. Requests the Executive Secretary to carry out a thorough analysis of these issues, study
successful initiatives in these areas and, above all, formulate realistic proposals in keeping with the
diversity of Latin America and the Caribbean as a priority contribution on the part of the Commission to
the fulfilment of the countries’ aspirations in terms of increasing equity, reducing poverty and reinforcing
social cohesion.

xenophobia. In return, migrants
must adhere to the laws of the host countries. Migration had significant macroeconomic effects and was
of benefit to everyone, although such benefits were diminished by the infringement of migrants’ rights
and the discrimination they suffered. Those were obstacles that must be overcome. Lastly, he reiterated
the Secretary-General’s appeal to all States that had not yet ratified the International Convention on the
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families to do so as soon as
possible, since such ratification would help countries to make full use of the benefits of international
migration.
6.
The outgoing Chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee and member of the Permanent Mission of
Brazil to the United Nations began his presentation with a review of the activities conducted in the region
to monitor the fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals and the Programme of Action of the
International Conference on Population and Development and drew attention to the important work
carried out by the Latin American and Caribbean Demographic Centre (CELADE)-Population Division of
ECLAC.
7.
With respect to ageing, he referred to the international meetings of experts organized by
CELADE in the region, in particular the important international seminars on indigenous peoples and
Afrodescendants. In addition, studies had been conducted which had demonstrated the social divide
existing between indigenous and non-indigenous populations. He stressed the importance of population
censuses for national and local planning and said that the support activities provided by CELADE in
editing census data had been of great value; he also mentioned the meetings of national statistical
directors and national health directors, the training workshops, the advances achieved with the
REDATAM software, the dissemination of population censuses via Internet and the creation and updating
of databases. Another aspect of the Centre’s work was its training activities in the areas of demographics,
population and development.
8.
The Director of CELADE said that the document on international migration presented at the
meeting summarized the results of various research studies carried out by the Centre during the biennium.
It had participated in a number of meetings of experts, national studies, training activities for researchers
and civil servants of countries of the region and in the update and expansion of the Investigation of
International Migration in Latin America (IMILA) database. Those activities had strengthened the
capacity of countries to address migration issues. The Centre was the repository of most of the census
microdatabases for the countries of the region. Those microdatabases had gradually been expanded to
incorporate information on ethnic groups affected by multiple inequalities, as demonstrated in the
Centre’s sociodemographic studies of indigenous peoples and other ethnic groups.
9.
During the period under review, the Centre had provided technical assistance to various countries
in formulating policies for older persons and incorporating the issue of ageing in the public agenda.

47

Studies had also been conducted on regional and national trends in ageing and on challenges in the area of
social protection, especially for women; policies and laws relating to older persons; the monitoring and
assessment of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing; methodologies for construction of
future scenarios on ageing; relevant indicators for the review of the status of older persons with special
reference to gender inequities; and family support networks and intergenerational transfers.
10.
Lastly, the Centre had conducted training and support activities relating to

Plan of Action on Ageing and summed up the agreements and resolutions of
the General Assembly, the Commission for Social Development and ECLAC relating to the monitoring
and assessment of those instruments. He said that the participatory approach was one of the main aspects
of that process, and underscored the need for the countries to identify the areas that they were interested
in evaluating through that approach. The regional commissions and in particular ECLAC had an
important role to play in coordinating relevant regional events and he concluded by proposing a working
agenda for 2006-2008 which included national and regional activities.
18.
The delegations that took the floor highlighted the need to establish and apply regulations for
protecting the rights of older persons, especially with respect to elder abuse and discrimination, as well as
the need to create opportunities for training in the area of ageing.
19.
The conclusions of the meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee are reflected in resolution 616(XXXI)
entitled “Population and development: priority activities for the period 2006-2008”.

Annex 2
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SOUTH-SOUTH COOPERATION

1.
The Committee on South-South Cooperation met as scheduled on 21 March 2006 during the

following countries were appointed to serve as presiding officers of the Committee:
Chairperson:
Vice-Chairpersons:

Trinidad and Tobago

Rapporteur:
2.

Dominican Republic

Uruguay

The Committee adopted the following agenda:
1.

Election of officers

2.

Adoption of the agenda

3.

Report on activities carried out within the ECLAC system to promote and support SouthSouth cooperation since the previous meeting of the Committee, held during the thirtieth
session of the Commission

4.

Opportunities and challenges for international cooperation and South-South cooperation in
Latin America and the Caribbean as viewed by ECLAC member countries

3.
In relation to agenda item 3, the Chief of the Project Management Unit of the Programme
Planning and Operations Division of ECLAC reported on the cooperation activities carried out by
ECLAC during the biennium, especially South-South cooperation, which included comparative studies,
seminars and workshops, as well as the sharing of experiences on initiatives and best practices in all the
subject areas included in the institution’s mandate, and gave a more detailed description of some of the
principal measures adopted. A considerable proportion of the funds for technical cooperation projects
came from the same countries that requested the Commission’s assistance in this area. Plans for the
following years envisaged extending South-South cooperation to countries in other regions, namely
Africa and Asia, through collaboration with the other United Nations regional commissions.
4.
Several delegations reported on South-South cooperation activities conducted by the
organizations and countries that they represented. They expressed concern that the duplication of work
and the persistence of ineffective practices should be avoided, and advocated strengthening dialogue
among donor agencies and between donors and beneficiaries. A representative of the Statistical
Conference of the Americas recommended that the donor agencies should use national data in their
projects and that the administration of such projects should be standardized at the international level.
5.
Delegations generally stressed that international cooperation should be provided on the basis of
each country’s economic and social development and that steps should be taken to review the indicators
and criteria used for the allocation of official development assistance, such as per capita GDP and the

50

human development index. One of the main points was the need to continue channelling official
development assistance to middle-income countries, which still had vulnerable sectors that required
attention. The innovative financing mechanisms whose development had begun in some of the countries
of the region must be implemented.
6.
The constraints posed by external debt payments on the implementation of socioeconomic
policies to ensure the well-being of all citizens and the limitations on the selection of priorities arising
from externally imposed strategies designed to solve debt problems were among the most important
issues raised by some delegations.
7
Some delegations requested ECLAC to commission a study on the available resources for the
creation of early-warning and vulnerability assessment systems aimed at reducing human and material
losses caused by natural disasters, especially in the Caribbean and Central America.
8
One delegation mentioned the difficulties facing South-South cooperation activities, such as lack
of information for evaluating the needs of countries, the scarcity of resources, the absence of appropriate
mechanisms for streamlining procedures for giving and receiving cooperation and the limited number of
institutions dedicated to horizontal cooperation. It was also stressed that sustainable development for all
the countries in the world implied that poor and middle-income countries should subscribe to a global
cooperation strategy to strengthen their capabilities and optimize their resources.
9
The Deputy Director of the Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean of the World
Food Programme said that within the framework of South-South cooperation, and taking into account the
Millennium Development Goals, in particular the target of halving the proportion of people who suffer
from hunger, the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean needed to strengthen cooperation in the
area of nutrition, especially for pregnant women, infants and children under the age of three. The World
Food Programme sought to provide a platform to facilitate South-South cooperation through a knowledge
management network and the sharing of experiences, to strengthen countries’ ability to design, manage
and assess the impact of nutritional programmes, and not only to halve the number of children suffering
from hunger in the region, but to eradicate child hunger completely, a target which was perfectly
achievable.
10.
The representative of the International Fund for Agricultural Development recalled that the
mission of the Fund was to help to reduce rural poverty in the world. Its comparative advantage was not
the amount of money that it mobilized but its flexibility in allocating assistance and its focus on demand
and on the development of local capabilities. The Fund emphasized work at the local level, both with
government authorities and with civil society associations and rural communities where programmes
supported by the Fund were in operation; its aim was to develop joint initiatives to in strengthen and
expand South-South cooperation both globally and regionally in order to share and disseminate successful
experiences of development and poverty reduction in rural areas.
11.
The conclusions of the meeting of the Committee on South-South Cooperation are reflected in
resolution 620(XXXI) entitled “South-South Cooperation”.
