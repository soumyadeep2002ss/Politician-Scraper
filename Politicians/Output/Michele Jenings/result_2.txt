Celebrating Remembrance 2023 at our sites around the world

13 NOVEMBER 2023

CELEBRATING REMEMBRANCE 2023 AT OUR SITES AROUND THE WORLD

For Armistice Day this Saturday and on Remembrance Sunday, visitors gathered at CWGC cemeteries and memorials around the world to pay tribute to the fallen on the two world wars as well as those that have fallen in all conflicts.

We were proud to welcome so many visitors to our sites, as we do each year, with the traditional 11am silence that represents the cease fire on the western front on 11 November 1918.

While fighting continued elsewhere, ultimately ending in Africa by the end of November that year, the silence, the sounding of the Last Post, and the laying of wreaths and poppies are a shared symbol of peace and commemoration.

Many CWGC staff attended services around the world.

A group of our colleagues were present at the Cenotaph on Sunday morning, representing our global teams as part of the traditional remembrance march past. Our new Patron, His Majesty King Charles, and our new President, Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal, lead the procession and laid the traditional poppy wreaths at the cenotaph.

Our Director General, Claire Horton CBE, our Vice Chairman, Vice Admiral Peter Hudson CB CBE, and Michelle Jennings, Director of the Commonwealth War Graves Foundation, all attended the Menin Gate, where the famous Last Post ceremony is held every night. The iconic memorial, which is currently undergoing an incredible restoration project, is one of the most well-known war memorials in the world.

Elsewhere, Remembrance events were held at our sites around the world, including the iconic Thiepval Memorial in France, Rome War Cemetery in Italy, Kanchanaburi War Cemetery in Thailand, and Dar es Salaam War Cemetery in Tanzania.
