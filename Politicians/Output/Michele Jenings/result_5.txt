Meet our Trustees: Michele Jennings

Michele is a Director of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and spent over ten years as Chief Executive of Hearing Dogs for Deaf People.

Before joining the not for profit sector, Michele was a Commercial Director, Marketing Director and Procurement Director, and worked for a number of major leisure brands including Rank Group, Pret a Manger, Cafe Rouge and PepsiCo. She is a Trustee of Assistance Dogs UK and The Royal Grammar School Foundation and volunteers for The Horse Trust.

Michele is a fan of classic rough collies and currently owns a playful shaded sable called Caldie, as well as two cats adopted in 2015 from Blue Cross, who give her whole family joy. She joined Blue Cross as a way of saying “thank you” for her daily dose of feline happiness!

Michele joined the Blue Cross Board in March 2023 and is a member of the Audit and Commercial committees.
