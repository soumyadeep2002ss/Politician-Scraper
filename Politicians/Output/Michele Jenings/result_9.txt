Unveiling of Runnymede Air Forces Memorial 70th Anniversary

18 OCTOBER 2023

UNVEILING OF RUNNYMEDE AIR FORCES MEMORIAL 70TH ANNIVERSARY

The Commonwealth War Graves Foundation (CWGF) was delighted to host an evening event on the 17 October 2023 to mark the 70th anniversary of the unveiling of the Runnymede Air Forces Memorial in Surrey.

The memorial was designed by Sir Edward Maufe with sculpture by Vernon Hill. It features engraved glass and painted ceilings designed by John Hutton with a poem written by Paul H Scott engraved on the gallery window. The memorial was originally unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 October 1953.

The Air Forces Memorial at Runnymede commemorates by name more than 20,000 men and women of the air forces, who were lost in the Second World War during operations from bases in the United Kingdom and North and Western Europe, and who have no known graves. They served in Bomber, Fighter, Coastal, Transport, Flying Training and Maintenance Commands, and came from all parts of the Commonwealth. Some were from countries in continental Europe which had been overrun but whose airmen continued to fight in the ranks of the Royal Air Force.

More than 130 individuals from across the country attended the event. This included members of the Armed Forces, local dignitaries, and friends of the Foundation.

“The 70th anniversary service was a fantastic event, added to by the beautiful and picturesque surroundings and the incredible display by both the Kings’ Colour Squadron and the band of the Royal Air Force Regiment,” said Michele Jennings, the Director of the Foundation at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. “It was wonderful to meet so many likeminded people, and to share the stories of those remembered at this magnificent memorial. The evening was every bit as special as we had hoped for.”

The service included hymns, a wreath-laying ceremony, speeches and culminated in a sunset ceremony. A replica Spitfire was on display throughout, and newly-installed lighting gloriously lit up the memorial.

At the anniversary event, CWGF supporter Mr Alastair Kerr was thanked for his extremely generous contribution that has paid for this new lighting to illuminate the memorial.
