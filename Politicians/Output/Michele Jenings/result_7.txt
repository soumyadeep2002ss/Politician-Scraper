Introducing For Evermore: Stories of the Fallen

10 OCTOBER 2023

INTRODUCING FOR EVERMORE: STORIES OF THE FALLEN

We are delighted to launch For Evermore: Stories of the Fallen – a new online resource that will collect the stories of the war dead from both world wars commemorated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

For Evermore: Stories of the Fallen is your opportunity to remember the stories that mean the most to you. Tell us about a relative, loved one or someone you have researched who today is commemorated at one of our cemeteries and memorials around the world.

We’ll collate your stories to create a single, searchable repository that honours the memory of the men and women across the Commonwealth who lost their lives during the world wars and ensure that these stories are available for the generations to come.

Claire Horton CBE, our Director General, said: “The launch of For Evermore marks an incredibly important milestone in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's mission. For Evermore will provide an opportunity for future generations to connect with their own history and learn more about those who served during the World Wars.

“By collating these stories in what will become the definitive resource of the stories of those who died in the world wars, we have created an enduring tribute to the men and women from across the Commonwealth who gave their lives, and we ensure that they will never be forgotten.”

Michelle Jennings, Director of the Commonwealth War Graves Foundation, said: "For Evermore will enable the Commonwealth War Graves Foundation to fulfil our mission of ensuring those who fought and died during the world wars are never forgotten. It is only through the kind support of many generous donors that we will be able to keep these stories alive in such an engaging way. We are deeply grateful to the Post Office Remembrance Fellowship for their support in enabling this project to be launched."

For Evermore has been generously funded by a grant to the CWGF from the Post Office Remembrance Fellowship (PORF):

“We are delighted that our support has enabled this ambitious project to be developed. For Evermore will engage a wide range of people and encourage them to discover and contribute to the stories which encompass our shared history, providing a living memorial to the men and women of the General Post Office who died in the two World Wars.”

While we welcome contributions from anyone interested in sharing their stories, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of content posted on For Evermore. It is designed as a shared resource, but content does not form part of CWGC’s official record.
