OUR ANNUAL REPORTS

This report details our work across an interesting and often challenging year – from the incredible, emotional moments that accompanied key Second World War anniversaries, to the unforeseen challenges that arose during the Coronavirus pandemic. It will give you an overview of the work we do today and of our staff who do it. It is a moment of reflection as we approach the end of an extraordinary year before we move on to the opportunities and challenges the future holds.

OUR FUNDING

The Commission seeks to provide value for money and respect the environment in which the war cemeteries and memorials are located. In 2019/20, the Commission received just under £65 million in funding, provided by the member governments of the Commonwealth nations who share the cost of the Commission's work proportionately to the number of their graves.
