Welcoming Ms Aruna Francesca Maria Gujral as the new Director-General of ICCROM

We are delighted to announce the beginning of Ms Aruna Francesca Maria Gujral's term as Director-General of ICCROM. Ms Gujral officially commenced her mandate in January 2024 following her nomination by the ICCROM Council and appointment by Member States at the 33rd session of the General Assembly in November 2023.

Upon the occasion of her appointment, Ms Gujral expressed her gratitude to the Member States and her commitment to leading ICCROM into a new chapter:

"Cultural and natural heritage, their management, preservation, conservation, protection and safeguarding need to be widely acknowledged as accelerators of progress, well-being and growth and as vital drivers for economic, social and environmental sustainability for our communities, our people and our planet. As the new Director-General, I am committed to making ICCROM more fit-for-purpose and fit-for-the-future, more strategic, dynamic and innovative. Together, we can make ICCROM a more effective, efficient, inclusive and relevant Organization that better serves the evolving needs of its Members". 

Ms Aruna Francesca Maria Gujral is an accomplished, dynamic, innovative and committed Thought Leader with more than 20 years of experience in the public and international development sectors. 

Ms Gujral joins ICCROM from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), where she covered leading roles in more than twenty countries in three different regions and served in several duty stations - at the country, subregional, regional and HQ levels. 

Her extensive background and vast experience in complex programme development and management, strategic planning and programming, governance and policy, coupled with remarkable and extensive expertise in mobilizing funds and forging multi-stakeholder partnerships, positions her as a guiding force for ICCROM. 

As we embark on this journey with Ms Gujral at the helm, we look forward to her visionary leadership, strategic direction and collaborative approach. With her guidance, ICCROM will continue to thrive and uphold its commitment to preserving and restoring our shared cultural heritage for a better future.
