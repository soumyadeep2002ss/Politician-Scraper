On 17 January 2024, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the accession of the Republic of South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ to ICCROM.

Together with the African World Heritage Fund, the Youth.Heritage.Africa (YHA) programme has made remarkable progress in helping young heritage leaders transform Africa's heritage into a catalyst for economic and social opportunities.
Â 
Last year, our latest engagement with Iziko Museums played a pivotal role in implementing the South African #HeritageHub. ICCROM's joint efforts with South Africa have also fostered the emergence of a strong network of professionals dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the country's cultural legacy, as done in 2023 to safeguard the World Heritage site of Robben Island.Â

On 17 January, the DG of ICCROM, Aruna Gujral, had the honour of receiving H.E. Carlos Garcia de Alba, Ambassador of Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ to Italy. Accompanied by Official Mauricio Guerrero, Deputy Head of Mission in charge of multilateral relations, the meeting provided an opportunity to revisit the longstanding partnership established in 1961. Delving into historical graphic materials from ICCROM's archives, the discussions highlighted the pivotal role of Mexico in promoting professionals in heritage conservation.

Together, we shared a vision for the upcoming years, emphasizing our collective commitment to heritage conservation and protection as drivers of well-being, progress and sustainable development.

On 16 January 2024, the Director-General of ICCROM, Aruna Francesca Maria Gujral, received a courtesy visit from H.E. Mirta Granda Averhoff, Ambassador of Cuba to Italy.

The meeting focused on discussing potential heritage conservation initiatives for both tangible and intangible heritage in Cuba and in the broader Latin America and Caribbean region. These include reducing risks to cultural heritage, especially in rapidly urbanizing cities in the region due to higher frequency and intensity of disasters that are exacerbated by climate change.
The meeting also included sharing images and videos from ICCROM archives about the courses held in Cuba since the 1980s, along with archival documents related to Cuba's accession to the Organization. These historical references served to highlight the longstanding collaboration between ICCROM and Cuba in the field of heritage preservation.

We thank the Ambassador for visiting and look forward to continuing our broad efforts to preserve and promote heritage in LAC.

Explore the rich history of the Great Mosque of Kairouan with ICCROM's January #ResourceOfTheMonth! This photograph shows the mihrab of the Great Mosque in Kairouan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1988, made of curved wood and thick plaster and adorned with plant motifs, demonstrating the essence of Islamic art and architecture.Â 
Captured in 1973 by Franco Rigamonti, this image is part of a series documenting the restoration work on the mihrab in the 1970s. 

Since 1962, ICCROM has carried out technical and advisory missions to Tunisia to train specialized staff and advise on conserving monuments, museums, historic city centres and archaeological sites. 

The Great Mosque of Kairouan received special attention from ICCROM, with consultations on mural paintings, the mihrab, and even the restoration of a wooden sarcophagus dating back to the Punic period. 

The journey didn't stop there â€“ ICCROM also assessed the Sfax Great Mosque and contributed to architectural and urban studies for the protection and enhancement of historic towns like Sfax and Testour. 

Delve into the fascinating history and conservation efforts through correspondence, reports, photographs, architectural drawings, and heritage samples available in the ICCROM Archives.
