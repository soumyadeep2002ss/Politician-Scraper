The annual research and third mission tab (its-r/tm) contains information e
The useful data for the evaluation and monitoring of research activities and third mission in Luiss, and is
therefore an integral part of the AVA system (self -assessment, periodic evaluation, accreditation), both
in terms of preparation for periodic accreditation visits - and therefore of evaluation of the system
University quality insurance - both as regards the annual verification of the research results
and the third mission of the University. The card allows the University and the departments to reflect on the

of his-RD (2014) and his-TM/IS (2018) and taking into account the monitoring needs
