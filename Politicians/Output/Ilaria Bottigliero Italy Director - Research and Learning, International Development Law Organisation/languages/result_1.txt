IDLO is in Nairobi for Africa Climate Week, from 4 – 8 September. 
 
At the Africa Climate Summit (4-6 September), we are exploring with our partners the link between sustainable climate action and economic development, and the power of a #ruleoflaw approach to sustainable agriculture, land and ocean use.
 
IDLO also has an exhibition booth in the Kenyatta International Convention Centre to share more about our work on #climatejustice and how we support people and institutions in using the #ruleoflaw to strengthen land governance on the continent.

On Gender Day at #COP28, proud to share the announcement that IDLO - International Development Law Organization has officially become a leader of the Generation Equality Action Coalition on Feminist Action for Climate Justice. 

Under the leadership of our Director-General Jan Beagle, IDLO made a landmark €500,000 commitment towards feminist climate action, by strengthening legal, regulatory and justice frameworks and supporting women leaders and women’s organizations in claiming their environmental rights. 

See article to learn more about how IDLO is translating those commitments into reality on the ground.
