EMBL Rome was established in 1999 to apply EMBL’s approach to research to the study of mammalian physiology and genetics

Today, research at the site focuses on the interdisciplinary investigation of epigenetics and neurobiology: EMBL Rome connects under one roof experts studying the control of gene expression with those examining sensory processing and behavioural control. The common theme explored in numerous projects across the site is how changes in gene expression and brain plasticity enable organisms to adapt to their environment.

The interdisciplinary focus and relatively small size of the Unit foster a special atmosphere that exemplifies the founding principles of EMBL as a dynamic, open and collaborative environment where new scientific ideas are born and shaped. In addition to research, the institute operates a set of core facilities supporting internal and external researchers to establish and deliver cutting-edge tools and technologies.

Researchers at EMBL Rome take advantage of close links with EMBL’s sites in Germany, France, Spain and the UK. These include collaborations with data science experts at EMBL-EBI in Hinxton, with structural biologists at EMBL Hamburg and EMBL Grenoble, and a wide range of molecular biologists and technology experts at EMBL Heidelberg and EMBL Barcelona that host a series of complementary core facilities in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and imaging.

The Interim Head of EMBL Rome is Dr Cornelius Gross.
