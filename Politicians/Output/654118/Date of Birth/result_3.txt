Statement delivered by 
Mr Franco Sanchez-Hidalgo 
Director of Programmes of the International Development Law Organization (IDLO) 
on the occasion of the 43rd Session of the FAO Conference (1-7 July 2023) 
5 July 
 
Thank you Mr. Chairperson. 
Distinguished guests and delegates,   
good afternoon. 
On behalf of. The International Development Law Organization and our Director-General, Ms. Jan Beagle, 
we wish to congratulate Mr QU Dongyu for his re-election as Director-General of FAO.  
All of us at IDLO look forward to continuing our fruitful cooperation with FAO to advance rule of law 
solutions for food security, gender equality, governance of land and natural resources, and climate justice. 
At this challenging moment marked by intersecting crises that disproportionally affect the most vulnerable 
across the globe, the significance of mutual collaboration and solidarity cannot be overstated. Embracing 
cross-cutting, whole-of-system, and whole-of-society approaches is vital. 
IDLO’s mandate is to promote the rule of law to advance peace and sustainable development. By applying  
Rule ofLaw and justice lens to development challenges, we strive to enhance food security, promote non-
discriminatory access to food, embed a gender perspective into food policies, and strengthen the legal basis 
for the right to food. 
The correlation between the rule of law and food security is evident on a global scale. Countries facing 
crises, where the rule of law has broken down, tend to have high levels of food insecurity. This is particularly 
true for conflict-affected and displaced populations. 
Recent events have underlined the interconnectedness of all seventeen Sustainable Development Goals, 
making it clear that collaborative and multistakeholder approaches are required. 
Violent conflict, the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effect of climate change contribute 
to increasing inequalities and are key drivers of intensifying levels of food insecurity and water scarcity. 
Rule of law principles can support efforts to improve Food Systems and Water Governance, ensuring equal 
access to natural resources. 
By implementing bottom-up and top-down approaches, we should work on strengthening sound legal 
frameworks, building capacities of institutions, and empowering communities. 
IDLO’s partnership with FAO on legal and regulatory measures for promoting food security for marginalized 
and vulnerable groups affected by health restrictions during COVID-19 is an example of how we can 
combine our expertise to address the complex challenges of today. Mr Chairperson,in this context, we look 
forward to maintaining close collaboration with FAO, and all our members and partners, as we work towards 
the sustainable transformation of food systems, based on the principles of justice, human rights, and the Rule 
Of Law. 
Thank you.
