How to apply for an Italy Visa from India ?
Do Indians need a visa to travel to Italy?

Yes. You will require a visa to travel to Italy, which is a member of the European Union (EU) and Schengen Area - meaning you will need a Schengen Italy Visa from India.

How do I apply for a Italy Visa from India?

You will first need to work out which Italy Visa you need, depending on your purpose, the length of your trip, and how many times you plan to visit. The standard Schengen Visa, for trips lasting up to 90 days, is a short-stay visa, with longer stays requiring a work, study or family reunion visa. Multiple-entry visas are also available if you plan on traveling regularly to the Schengen Area.

You must apply for your visa no more than six months, and no fewer than 15 days, before your trip. You will need to fill out your application, pay a fee, obtain all the documents you need for your Italy Visa, and attend an interview at a consulate, embassy, or visa application center.

How much does an Italy Visa application cost?

Upon filling out your application, you will need to pay a fee of €80 for adults and €40 for minors. Visa fees are waived for children under six years of age, as well in special circumstances for those traveling for study purposes, researchers, those under 25 years old traveling with charitable organizations, and those taking part in sporting or cultural events. 

What documents do I need to apply for a short-stay Italy Visa from India?

First of all, you need to download and complete a Schengen Visa application form.

Applicants will also need two recently taken passport-style photos, an Indian passport or other travel documents that are no older than 10 years and valid for at least three months after your departure date from Italy, or the Schengen Area, if you plan to travel to other countries. Travel and medical insurance covering you up to costs of €30,000 is also required, as is evidence of legal residence in India (such as an ID card), a cover letter stating your itinerary and the purpose of your visit, as well as a flight itinerary and proof of accommodation during your stay, proof of your civil status, like a marriage certificate, and proof you have means of subsistence to support yourself during your stay. You will need to obtain all the documents you need for your Italy Visa, and attend an interview at a consulate, embassy, or visa application center.

How much do I need in the bank to obtain a Visa to Italy?

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Italy, the following are the required amounts of means of subsistence needed to be attested by a foreigner, at the moment of applying for an Italian Visa to an Italian embassy or consulate. For stays up to five days, the overall amount is €269.60 per person and €212.81 if you are traveling in a party of two and more persons. For stays six to 10 days, the daily amount is €44.93 per person and €26.33 for two or more persons. For stays of 11-20 days, you need a fixed sum of €51.64 per person and €25.82 each for two more persons, plus €36.67 per day of your stay, and €22.21 each per day for two and more persons. For stays over 20 days, the overall amount required is the basic amount of €206.58 per person or €118.79 for two and more persons, plus a daily amount of €27.89 and €17.04 for two or more persons.

What additional documents do I need to get an Italy Visa to work or study?

If you are planning to work or study in Italy for fewer than 90 days, then you will need additional documents to obtain your visa. These include an employment contract, a current bank statement, a no-objection letter from your Indian employer, and an income tax return. The self-employed need an income tax return, and a company bank statement, as well as any licensing documentation. As a student, you will need proof that you are enrolled at an educational institution in Italy, and if possible, a no-objection letter from your current Indian institution.

If you are planning to study in Italy for more than 90 days, you will need to apply for a residence permit national study visa - providing evidence of your enrolment and plans to reside in Italy. Similarly, for work visas, you should provide evidence of a salaried employment contract. Those who are highly skilled or who earn high salaries (approximately €55,200) can apply for an EU Blue Card, entitling you to work across the European Union. Otherwise, you should check that your qualifications and skills match the strict requirements for entry set by the Italian government.
