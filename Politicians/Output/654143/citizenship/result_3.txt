Expats from India
Life in Europe
Italy

When moving from India to the West, the UK is the first destination that comes to mind. Yet, a less-known fact is that Italy has become the first choice for Indians settling in mainland Europe. As per the Economic Times, some 200 thousand Indians resided in Italy when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. According to the Ministry of External Affairs’ data on the Indian population in Italy, there are 157 695 non-resident Indians (NRIs) and 45 357 persons of Indian origin (PIO) in the country. What is it like to be an Indian in Italy? Which city is the best to choose? What is the cost of living in Italy for an Indian? Is it easy for an Indian to work in Italy? This article has all these questions answered.

Indians in Italy: key facts

First, let us dwell on some facts and figures on immigration to Italy from India. According to Vincenzo de Luca, Italy’s Ambassador to India, a large part of Indians in Italy are from the state of Punjab; in-depth research also states that many of those who migrated to Italy from India originate from Haryana and Kerala. The Indian population in Italy was ten times smaller some two decades ago, and as new opportunities appear, this growth shows no sign of slowing down.

How to find a job in Italy

Many of the Indians who come to the UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Italy are looking for a higher income. In particular, they seek opportunities to settle in the new country and to support their loved ones back home (sending money from Europe to India). Sometimes, they keep money in their own accounts in the Indian banks to save a solid amount for retirement.

What about the work for Indians in Italy? While the overall unemployment rate in the country is considered to be relatively high, it is gradually decreasing. In August 2023, the UR was just 7.3%, while in 2022, it was above 8%. In addition to that, Vincenzo de Luca indicated a growth in the number of residence permits issued for Indians in Italy, adding that many of them were approved due to requests from middle and small industries in the country.

Indians in Italy: key facts

Therefore, it seems that finding a job in Italy is not that difficult. It is worth noting that the advice for Indians willing to work as unqualified personnel and for skilled professionals looking for a job offer will differ. Another important point is that choosing the place to live may depend on the work. Professionals with a prominent experience should consider bigger cities like Rome, Milan or Turin. As for those starting their career, the choice may depend on the field they prefer:

Sector
Part of Italy
Industry
North
Agriculture
South
HoReCa
Islands

Obviously, one can get a job in a catering service in Milan (north of Italy) or a job at a farm in Sicily (one of Italy’s best-known islands). However, most of the offers are distributed as per the table above.

Where Indians settle in Italy

Job openings are not the only factor to be considered when choosing the right place to settle in Italy. Naturally, the cost of living in a big city may be higher than in small towns and villages. Another important criterion is the number of Indian migrants in a certain city. If you are wondering how to settle in Italy as an Indian, check out these cities and towns with a strong Indian community:

Bergamo,

Brescia,

Latina,

Mantua,

Rome.

Smaller towns may also become home for those who migrate to Italy from India. A good example is Lavinio, which is sometimes even called ‘love-India’ by the locals.

Italian visa for Indians

If you want to learn how to go to Italy from India, you may already know that you will need a Schengen visa. Therefore, the first required steps are:

Choosing the type of visa

If you want to visit Europe as a tourist before settling there and are trying to figure out what is the best time to visit Italy for an Indian, a short-term visa would be enough. This type of visa allows you to stay in Italy for up to 90 days (the period may be shorter, depending on the declared duration of your trip). However, if your short-term stay implies working in Italy, you may need to provide additional documents, like a no-objection letter from your employer.

Choosing the right place to apply

If you need advice on how to go to Italy from India, you should bear in mind that visa applications may be processed in:

The Embassy of Italy in New Delhi,

The Consulate of Italy in Mumbai,

The Consulate of Italy in Kolkata.

Note that the place of application depends on your current residency rather than on your origin.

Collecting the necessary documents

The list of documents for an Indian applying for an Italian visa may change depending on the situation. Therefore, preparing for your immigration to Italy from India in advance is crucial. For a long-term visa, you will surely need your employment contract or evidence of enrollment from an educational institution.

The complete list of documents required for the Italian visa depends on its type and may be found on the official website of VFS Global.

Tips for Indians moving to Italy
Cost of living in Italy

While most Indians in Italy agree that the country is a great place to live thanks to the high quality of life and friendly locals, the expenses may be enduring. According to various data on the cost of living in Italy for Indians and other foreigners, the cities where you will have to spend most are:

Milan,

Bologna,

Florence.

If you need advice on how to settle in Italy after coming from India, a useful practice would be to compare the cost of living in your current city with one in Italy.

Here is the result for Rome vs Delhi:

Consumer prices in Rome would be 144% higher,

Rent prices in Rome would be 307% higher,

Groceries prices in Rome would be 131% higher.

And these are the numbers for Milan vs Mumbai:

Consumer prices in Milan would be 64% higher,

Rent prices in Milan would be 53% higher,

Groceries prices in Milan would be 61% higher.

This difference is important to consider if you are planning to migrate to Italy from India. Yet, Italian salaries are way higher than those in India, so your new expenses would not be that hard. On the contrary, we hope that you will learn to manage your budget properly so that you will be able both to enjoy living in Italy as an Indian and to support your family back home.

Tips for Indians moving to Italy
Learn Italian

Many of those who migrated to Italy from India insist that speaking the same language is vital for assimilation. They are sure that once you speak Italian, you will be treated as a local. Even though many people in big cities speak English on a basic level, you will likely need Italian to work or study.

Embrace the local diaspora

As we mentioned above, there is a strong Indian diaspora in Italy. You may try to get in touch with them via social media and experience the unique blend of Asian and European cultures.

Stay in touch with your family

Even though making new friends in Italy will definitely keep your spirit high, your loved ones back home will still miss you. At some point, the immigration to Italy from India may bring you unexpected challenges, and in that case, the support of your Indian friends and family may be exactly what you need. After living abroad for more than a year, you will easily figure out the best time to visit Italy for your close ones from India. Before you meet in Rome or Pisa, you may keep in touch with them by scheduling video calls (mind the time zone difference!) or sending money from Italy to India.

Manage your budget wisely

Once you are in Italy, you will have to go through various procedures to confirm your legal status. Some Indians in Italy indicate that the level of bureaucracy in the country is relatively high. Something you will definitely have to do is open an account in an Italian bank: a local card will be needed to get your salary.
