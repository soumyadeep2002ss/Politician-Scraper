In Karnataka Power Transmission Corpn. Ltd. v. S Kiran,10 a division bench comprising of Prasanna B Varale,* CJ., and Krishna S Dixit, J., upheld an order of a Single Judge which directed the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited to reinstate an employee who was dismissed from service due to unauthorised absence of 632 days (about 1 year 9 months) on account of suffering from mental depression.

“Distress and depressions are the byproducts of modern life, whichever be the calling. Stress is the product of the psychological or emotional pressure that we experience both in our personal and occupational lives. Often it is difficult to insulate the stress, and to determine its impact on day to day activities. There may come a point that the ‘stressors’ encountered in the work place lead to the inability to function in a work environment. A decision to lay an employee off work, with or without just cause, may well escalate the level of depression.”

In High Court of Karnataka v. State of Karnataka,11 where the Court took suo-motu cognizance of the news articles published in Daily News Papers namely, ‘Deccan Herald’, Bengaluru edition, dated 12-12-2023 under the caption ‘Woman beaten up, paraded naked after son elopes with girl’, a Division Bench comprising Prasanna B. Varale, CJ., and M.G.S Kamal, J., directed to not telecast the video of interviews of the victim who was paraded naked.

“Though the print media has at least displayed some sensibility and sensitivity while publishing the photograph by blurring the image of the victim and her associates but the disturbing factor is the said photograph reveals that some persons apparently from the electronic media or its representatives are photographing and vediographing the victim’s reaction and narration. Thus, on one hand, where there is a reflection of sensibility, on the other hand there is stark contrast wherein the media persons are seem to be acting most irresponsible and insensitive manner.”

In Mahalakshmamma v. Department of Rural Development and Panchayathraj,12 an appeal by second wife pertaining to family pension, a division bench comprising of Prasanna B. Varale,* CJ., and Krishna S Dixit, J., held that “family Pension is payable to the “wife”, and not to those whose marriage is ‘no marriage’ in the eye of law, the limited status of legitimacy of children begotten therefrom, by virtue of Sec.16 1955 Act, notwithstanding.”

In Chamarajpet Nagarikar Okkuta (R) v. State of Karnataka,13 a writ petition seeking directions against the respondent 2 to consider the petitioner’s request to allow them to celebrate Karnataka Rajyotsava at the Idga Maidan at Chamarajapet, a division bench comprising of Prasanna B. Varale,* CJ., and Krishna S Dixit, J., observed that the celebration of secular events are not objected to in a welfare state, subject to certain just exceptions.

In Narendra Babu GV v. State of Karnataka,14 a case pertaining to notification inviting applications for the recruitment of Graduate Primary School Teachers in government and aided institutions in Karnataka, a division bench comprising of Prasanna B Varale, CJ., and MGS Kamal, J., held that the post of a primary school teacher is a “civil post”, and therefore, the jurisdiction to deal with issues pertaining to it

The Court expressed that “relationship in between brother and sister, relationship in between mother and son, relationship in between father and daughter and so on were considered as sacrosanct. However, due to passage of time, these relationships have no more remained sacrosanct and there are various instances of overstepping the sacrosanct relationship by the near relationship.”

The trauma which victim has to undergo, after the incident does not stop there and when it comes to facing real-life issues, there may be occasion for the victim to forego all the trauma which she had undergone and to take U turn.”
