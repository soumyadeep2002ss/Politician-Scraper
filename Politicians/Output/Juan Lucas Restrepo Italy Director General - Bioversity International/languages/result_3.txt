Students from Universidad Icesi, in #Colombia, designed Theobroma, an academic proposal that identified export opportunities for chocolate made with #cocoa produced by smallholder farmers participating in the Alliance's SLUS project, focused on promoting sustainable land use systems whilst promoting peace and combating deforestation, within CGIAR's Resilient AgriLAC Initiative. Learn more about this initiative that includes marketing strategies, partnerships with environmental organizations and packaging design, and that promotes one of the most appreciated crops worldwide, not only for its taste, nutritional properties, energy and antioxidants, but also for its commitment to peace building. https://bit.ly/497YClT
