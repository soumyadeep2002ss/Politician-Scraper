As we approach the end of this year, I'm filled with pride and gratitude for our collective achievements as CGIAR and the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT. Thanks to our scientists who keep striving to produce new #science and #innovation to leave no one behind. A big thanks goes also to our #partners, a key element in the engine of scientific innovation, and of course to our funders, for continuing to believe in our potential to achieve #zerohunger and combat #climatechange. There still lots to do to achieve our mission and one year less separating us from 2030, so 2024 will be all about acceleration and stepping up our efforts. Wishing you all joyful holidays, filled with cherished moments and a chance to recharge for the opportunities and challenges the new year holds.

What a week at #COP28 ! 1️⃣ CGIAR hosted for the second year the #Food and #Agricuture pavilion, together with FAO International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and The Rockefeller Foundation 2️⃣ We launched the Alliance of Champions along with three countries and multiple partners - a mechanism that will help build coherence across global policy processes on #foodsystem, #climatechange and #biodiversity 3️⃣ We supported multiple negotiation processes including the #SSJWA, #GST and #GGA, providing #evidence and #science And much more! Thanks to all our #partners and colleagues from across the world who joined us to raise awareness on the importance of including #food into #climate conversations. We might not be there yet, but we will keep working hard to keep #food high on the agenda.
