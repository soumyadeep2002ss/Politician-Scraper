What comes to mind when you think of an entrepreneur? Is it a cacao farmer? Cacao farmers are not just cultivators, but true entrepreneurs and experts in their business, from running their farms to navigating the ups and downs of the market. They are truly the unsung heroes of the chocolate we all enjoy today. This is why we do what we do. Empowering, recognising, and rewarding cacao farmers for more fair and sustainable #foodsystems. Now sit back, relax and soak up 5 reasons you'll want to tune-into the world's premier global cacao competition, the Cacao of Excellence Awards.üëáüèæüåü

As we approach the end of this year, I'm filled with pride and gratitude for our collective achievements as CGIAR and the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT. Thanks to our scientists who keep striving to produce new #science and #innovation to leave no one behind. A big thanks goes also to our #partners, a key element in the engine of scientific innovation, and of course to our funders, for continuing to believe in our potential to achieve #zerohunger and combat #climatechange. There still lots to do to achieve our mission and one year less separating us from 2030, so 2024 will be all about acceleration and stepping up our efforts. Wishing you all joyful holidays, filled with cherished moments and a chance to recharge for the opportunities and challenges the new year holds.
