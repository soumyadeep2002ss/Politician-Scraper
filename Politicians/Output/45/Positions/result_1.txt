Ending the suspense eight days after the result day, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced Mohan Yadav as the new Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. The announcement of his name was made in a meeting of the legislative party.

Mohan Yadav is a legislator from the Ujjain South constituency and has been winning the legislative election for three consecutive terms since 2013.

In the Ujjain South seat, Mohan Yadav defeated his closest competitor, Congress candidate Chetan Premnarayan Yadav, by 12,941 votes. While Mohan Yadav received 95,699 votes, Chetan Premnarayan Yadav received 82,758 votes.

It is noteworthy that Mohan Yadav is considered a close associate of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders. His political career began with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).

In 1984, he took on the responsibility of the ABVP Nagara Mantri in Ujjain. Between 1993 and 1995, he held the position of RSS Ujjain City's Kshetra Pracharak.

He served as the President of the Madhav Science College Student Union in 1984. From 2004 to 2010, he served as the Chairman of the Ujjain Development Authority.

From 2011 to 2013, he was the Chairman of the MP State Tourism Development Corporation. He was a legislator from 2013 to 2018 and, after being elected for the second time, he served as the Minister of Higher Education in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government.

Mohan Yadav is known for his untarnished reputation. He is a B.Sc., LL.B., M.A. (Political Science), M.B.A. and Ph.D. He is also considered close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah

Mohan Yadav, hailing from the Other Backward Class (OBC), has been chosen for the role. With this decision, the BJP aims to garner support from the OBC community, constituting more than half of the voters in Madhya Pradesh.
