Controversies	Not allowed campaigning in bypoll election
In 2020, the Election Commission banned Mohan from campaigning in the state bypolls for a day on 31 October due to the use of intemperate language used by him. [2]


Statement against Department of Higher Education
In 2021, Mohan became part of the controversy when the Department of Higher Education issued a law stating that if any student had a criminal record against him, he/she would not be given admission in college. After the law was issued, many students protested and Mohan made a statement in which he said that if a politician can contest elections in the Lok Sabha and Vidhansabha, why can a student not be given admission. However, the law was taken back by the department. [3]


Remarks against Mother Sita
On 18 December 2022, Mohan made disgraceful comments to mother Sita at the Karsevak Samman ceremony held in Nagda. In the comment, he said,

"Ramji had to leave Sita Mata because of the dignity of the state even though she was pregnant. Sita Mata's children had to be born in the jungle, despite so much suffering, that mother has so much respect for her husband that she forgets the hardships and prays for Lord Rama's life. In today's era, this life is like life after divorce."

After his video went viral on social media, he clarified his remarks and said,

"The program was to honor the sacrifice of Kar Sevaks. That's why I said something about Ram Rajya. At its root was the sacrifice and love of Rama and Sita. I was telling what sacrifices Lord Rama had to make for the kingdom, what hardships had to be suffered. My point is being misrepresented." [4]


Comments on Republic Day parade
In January 2022, Mohan took to social media to comment on the Republic Day parade and said,

"Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was there, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was there in the Republic Day parade. There was neither the fake father of the country, nor the fake uncle of the country, nor the iron lady, nor the inventor of the computer in the parade. There was a tableau of Kashi Vishwanath in the parade, there was a tableau of Goddess Vaishnodevi, there was a scene of eternal culture. My country is really changing, my country is coming out from the jaws of English slaves, my country is really getting free."

Later, Congress Working President Ravi Rai commented on Mohan's remark and said,

"What message the Higher Education Minister wants to give to the society by making such a statement. We condemn such posts on the occasion of Republic Day. This is the mindset of RSS and BJP and Godse. He said that the Godse ideology of the minister has shown that he is saying wrong things about Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi." [5]
