Bhopal: The new chief minister, Mohan Yadav has a deep interest in religious, adventure and water tourism. He was chairman of MP State Tourism Development Corporation for three years (2011-2013) and took several initiatives to promote tourism.
He has received the President's Award twice for development of tourism in the state during his tenure. It is expected that after his arrival as CM, tourism will touch new heights in the state.

MPT’s PRO Vikas Khare who had worked with CM Yadav during his tenure as chairman of the corporation, said that several important initiatives took place at that time. “Sair Sapata, which is an important tourist destination in the state capital was started during his tenure. This was the best example of his promotion of water tourism,” said PRO Khare. Citing another example, he added, “He had started a bus from Ujjain to Omkareshwar during his tenure so that people could go and see two Jyotirlings in a day only as the bus returns the same day,” he claimed.
The Hanuwantiya water tourism centre built on the backwater banks of Indira Sagar Dam in Punasa tehsil of the district is also sure to get a new identity. After Hanuwantiyatook shape in the year 2015, former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been present at the inauguration of the Water Festival held here every November-December. Now, seeing the interest in tourism and the yearning for development of CM Yadav, Hanuwantiya may get expansion and a new identity. Due to the assembly elections, Jal Mahotsav has not started yet this year. Every year Hanuwantiya becomes abuzz with the two-month festival. The event awaits launch.

Khare said that CM Yadav was awarded back-to-back awards in 2012 and 2013 by the then Presidents Pratibha Patil and Pranav Mukherji. “During his tenure as chairman of MPT, the tourism department touched new heights. I am sure he will leave no stone unturned to promote tourism,” he said.
