One of the first decisions taken by Yadav's cabinet is to enact a complete ban on the open sale of non-vegetarian food like meat, fish & eggs within the state as per the Food Safety Act and the guidelines of the Central government.[5]

After the inauguration of Yadav's government, homes of three men who allegedly attacked a BJP worker were razed by bulldozers on 15 December 2023, emulating the example of Hindu hardliner politician Yogi Adityanath, which is often criticised as a form of Collective punishment.[6][7]

Controversies[edit]
Bajrang Bali welcome controversy[edit]

A stir of controversy unfolded as a person dressed as Hanuman, a revered deity in Hinduism, welcomed the newly appointed Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, Mohan Yadav, at an event in Ujjain. The incident, caught on video, depicted the individual mimicking flight to present Yadav with a garland while hanging from a crane. The spectacle unfolded amidst a large crowd gathered for the Chief Minister's entry ceremony, raising questions about the appropriateness of the act.[8]

The Congress party swiftly condemned the incident, with its spokesperson expressing strong disapproval, questioning the necessity of hanging a depiction of Bajrang Bali on a crane to welcome the Chief Minister, characterizing the act as crossing all limits. The theatrical nature of the welcome stirred debate, prompting reflection on the appropriateness of religious symbolism in political events.[8]

Prime Meridian Controversy[edit]

In a surprising turn of events, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav stirred controversy with his claim that India played a pivotal role in establishing global time standards around 300 years ago. Asserting that Ujjain still houses an ancient timekeeping instrument, Yadav boldly announced his government's ambition to shift the Prime Meridian from Greenwich, England, to Ujjain, challenging the established international reference for time.[9]

Awards & recognition[edit]
He was awarded by the President of India in 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 for promoting tourism in the state. Yadav's rise began with the ABVP. In 1982, he became the co-secretary of the student union of Madhav Science College, and became the president in 1984.[citation needed]

Ujjain Simhastha Land Acquisition[edit]

Under the Ujjain Master Plan 2035, 872 acres of land were reserved for Ujjain Simhastha - 2028 (Kumbh Mela). According to Ravi Rai (councillor from the INC party), 450 complaints were received against the master plan by the V&CP, 250 of which were by people who claimed to be living on that land for many years. Those complaints were rejected. However 185 acres of that land was removed from the land acquisition plan, 29 acres of which was registered in the name of Mohan Yadav (erstwhile Minister of Higher Education of Madhya Pradesh), his wife Seema Yadav, his sisters Leela Yadav and Kalawati Yadav who is chairperson of Ujjain Municipal Corporation and his servants. The land use categorisation of this released land was also changed from agricultural use to residential use, so that private colonies can be constructed on the land. Mohan Yadav owned 8 parts of this land. Allegedly the Ujjain master plan was stuck for 2.5 years to take care of Mohan Yadav's interests.[10]

After the construction of a bypass during the last Simhastha fair, builders and BJP politicians started taking interest in the land and started acquiring it from farmers. Land use categorisation was changed from agricultural use to residential use for the lands belonging to BJP affiliated builders and BJP politicians, for example20in%20The%20CASE%20OF%20vibhash%20upadhyy%20 (Vice%20president%20OF%20MADHYA 20PRADESH 20JAN%20ABHIYAIAN%20parishad%20and%20cabinet%20minister%20and%20his%20Wife%20kavita%20UP Adhyay. 20is%20Stimated%20That%20simhastha-2028%20would%20SEE%2010%20To%2013%20core%20TtenDEES%20for%20which 20more%20Land%20was%20NEDED%20but%20despite 20That%2c e 20Builders%2C%20mohan%20yadav%20and%20OTER%20BJP%20Politicians%20were%20PRIONITIIIII. 3%20%e0%a4%ae%e0%a5%8B%e0%a4%b9%e0%a4%a8%20%e0%a4%AF%e0%a4%be%e0%a4%a6%e0% A4%B5%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B2%20%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%87% 20MP%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%87%20cm 20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A6%20%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%80%20%E0% A4%b6%e0%a4%aa%e0%a4%a5%2C 20pm 20pm 20%e0%a4%a%e0%a5%8B%e0%a4%a6%e0%a5%80%20%e0% A4%94%e0%a4%b0%20%e0%a4%b6%e0%a4%be%e0%a4%b9%20%e0%a4%b8%e0%a4%b9%e0%a4%bf% E0%a4%a4%20%e0%a4%95%e0%a4%88%20%e0%a4%a6%e0%a4%bf%e0%a4%97%e0%a5%8d%e0%a4% 97%e0%a4%9c 20%E0%a4%b9%e0%a5%8B%e0%a4%82%e0%a4%97%e0%a5%87%20%e0%a4%b6%e0% A4%be%e0%a4%ae%e0%a4%bf%e0%a4%b2%22.%20AAR 20ujala%20 (in%20hindi). 20%0AJUMP%20UP%20To%3A%0aa%20B%20c 20D 20D%20E 20%22%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B5%2C% 20%e0%a4%a1%e0%a5%89.%20%e0%a4%a%e0%a5%8B%e0%a4%b9%e0%a4%a8%22%20 (pdf).%20MADHYA 20pradesh%20LEGISTIVE%20assembly 20%(In%20HINDI). 13%20DECEMBER%202023).
