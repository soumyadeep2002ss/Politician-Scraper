Mohan Yadav (58), a BJP MLA from Ujjain South, was sworn in as the next Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday. Yadav, who had defeated the rival Congress candidate by a margin of 12,941 votes, will succeed Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who completed four terms as the CM of the state where the BJP registered a resounding victory in the assembly polls.

Ever since the results, speculation has been rife over who the next CM would be – Shivraj, whose ‘laadli behna’ scheme played a key role in the party’s win, or a new face.

“He (Yadav) is an able administrator. We expect him to carry forward the party’s development policies. The BJP has asked me to be a state legislator; I will fulfil my duties. I was never in the race myself,” Singh said.

Yadav, an OBC leader, was elected at a meeting in Bhopal held in the evening in presence of central observers, the BJP said.

“This is for new energy, new hope, new development. In the new India that Modi ji is working for, Madhya Pradesh will lead as a model. The state under new leadership will fulfil his dreams,” BJP general secretary and party MLA Kailash Vijayvargiya told The Indian Express.

“We are very happy with this decision. He comes from the OBC background. This is a moment of pride; he is connected to the ground. We all come from Ujjain and are extremely hopeful he will take the state to new heights,” MLA Govind Singh Rajput said.

A member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Ujjain for three terms, Yadav served as the education minister in the government under Chouhan.
