Parvati Devi

Amritsar, Punjab

Parvati Devi was an ardent member of the Indian National Congress in Punjab. She was born in April 1888 in Lyallpur, Punjab. Her father Lala Karam Chand was a rich and prosperous man in the area. She passed her middle class from Kanya Maha Vidyalaya, Jalandhar. She got married to Dr. Milkhi Ram Bhatia, employed in the Railway Services. Her husband died after two and half years in an accident so she came back to the house of her father. She studied Sanskrit and became a teacher in Delhi. She came back to Amritsar and started to work as a teacher in the city when the Anti-Rowlatt Act Agitation was going on in 1919. She joined the freedom struggle of the country and became an active worker in the Congress party. She was arrested in Meerut because of her inflaming speeches and was taken to Agra jail. Many women took out a procession as a mark of respect to her on December 16, 1922. She was sentenced to two years imprisonment, the highest punishment awarded to any lady. She remained active in the service of people throughout her life.
