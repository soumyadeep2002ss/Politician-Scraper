The location of the building was arranged in 1423 by disposition of the privilege of the Union of the Unification and Pacification of Pamplona by Carlos III of Navarra. It was located in a place without building and equidistant of the different Burgos of Pamplona.

Several buildings have occurred in this same location. Thus, in 1753 the primitive was demolished and a new one began to be built by the architect Juan Miguel Goyeneta and Rococó style facade of José Zay and Lorda made in 1755, but which in the upper part was modified a year later by Juan Lorenzo Catalán. This facade is the only thing left of the building at that time. However, it has a baroque taste in some details such as iron balcony and the allusive sculptures of prudence, justice, Hercules and fame.2

The interior of the building was completely shot down, disappearing a splendid baroque ladder by José Mazal, and rebuilt in 1951 under the direction of the architect José Yárnoz Orcoyen.2
