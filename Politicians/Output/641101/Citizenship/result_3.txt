THE SECRETARY,

Mr Rafael Andrés León Cavero, State Attorney

Agreement of the members of the Committee on the unanimous designation of the list of proposed candidates, submitted on 1st November 2017 to the Secretary

Evaluation of candidates by the selection committee in order to submit the list of proposed candidates to the council of ministers submitted by the Spanish government for election as Spanish judge to the European Court of Human Rights.

The selection Committee first and foremost recognises the quality of the candidates applying to this call, all of them of the highest moral character and with recognised professional competence within the legal field.

Secondly, the Committee deems it necessary to apply a first filtering by which, either for lacking the required language proficiency, for not being able to hold office for at least half of the period before reaching the retirement age or for lacking expertise in terms of fundamental rights and in particular in the field of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the profiles of some candidates have not been considered eligible strictu sensu for office as a Judge to the European Court of Human Rights.

Among the remaining candidates, who a priori fulfil all requirements, the Committee believes that the following candidates are the most suitable, and allow to fulfil the recommendation of gender-balance:

Ms MARÍA ELÓSEGUI ICHASO

This candidate fulfils the criterion of being jurisconsult of recognised competence. Her professional career is essentially academic and, under it, she has served as an expert appointed to a Commission of the Council of Europe.

She has been Professor of Philosophy of Law since 2010. She has lived and has been educated for more than five years in a number of Member States of the Council of Europe, which confers her some familiarity with different judicial cultures such as the French-speaking, English-speaking or Germanic. She has also taken part in Conferences of the United Nations on the principle of equity of gender. In addition to her work on fundamental rights, she has specialized in methods of legal interpretation, legal arguments, weighing and applying the principle of proportionality, specifically regarding the implementation of those techniques to controversial questions on human rights.

Related to this, she has acted as consultant to different governments by drafting bills on gender equality, family law, development cooperation and also in the European Parliament initiative on the consequences of globalization for women immigrants from Mediterranean countries.

Mr JOSÉ MARTÍN Y PÉREZ DE NANCLARES

This candidate fulfils the criterion of being jurisconsult of recognised competence, with an essentially academic profile and with experience acting before international courts.

He has been Professor%20of%20Public%20International%20Law%20since%202011%2C%20with%20formal%20training%20in%20Constitutional%20Law%20through%20postgraduate%20studies.%20He%20holds%20a%20Master%E2%80%99s%20degree%20and%20a%20PhD%20in%20European%20Law%20from%20different%20German%20universities.%20He%20has%20extensively%20published%20within%20the%20scope%20of%20human%20rights%2C%20public%20international%20law%20and%20constitutional%20law%20and%20on%20the%20judicial%20dialogue%20between%20the%20ECJ%20and%20the%20ECHR.%20He%20has%20carried%20out%20a%20number%20of%20activities%20linked%20to%20the%20protection%20of%20human%20rights%2C%20especially%20within%20the%20field%20of%20NGOs%2C%20in%20particular%20his%20involvement%20as%20legal%20expert%20on%20international%20law%20in%20an%20international%20field%20mission%20on%20extrajudicial%20executions%20should%20be%20stressed.%20He%20therefore%20has%20a%20wealth%20of%20international%20experience%20and%20knowledge%20of%20legal%20systems%20from%20other%20States%20on%20both%20a%20theoretical%20and%20practical%20level.%0A%0AFinally%2C%20it%20is%20worth%20mentioning%20that%20he%20has%20been%20involved%20in%20collegiate%20bodies%20and%20international%20working%20groups%20of%20different%20scope%20(European%20Union%2C%20Council%20of%20Europe%20and%20United%20Nations)%2C%20which%20gives%20him%20the%20ability%20to%20connect%20different%20legal%20subsystems%20within%20the%20international%20order.%0A%0AMr%C2%A0FRANCISCO%20DE%20AS%C3%8DS%20P%C3%89REZ%20DE%20LOS%20COBOS%20ORIHUEL%0A%0AThis%20candidate%20combines%20both%20professional%20requirements%20alternatively%20provided%20for%20in%20Article%2021%20of%20the%20ECHR%20for%20judges%20of%20the%20European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights%2C%20due%20to%20his%20qualification%20derived%20from%20occupying%20the%20highest%20position%20in%20the%20constitutional%20order%20as%20for%20being%20a%20judge%20with%20recognized%20competence%20on%20fundamental%20rights%20with%20a%20long%20professional%20career.%0A%0AIn%20particular%2C%20he%20has%20been%20a%20Judge%20at%20the%20Constitutional%20Court%20(2011-2017)%20and%20its%20President%20(2013-2017).%20He%20has%20been%20Professor%20of%20Labour%20and%20Social%20Security%20Law%20since%201994.%0A%0AAll%20along%20his%20professional%20career%20he%20has%20widely%20devoted%20himself%2C%20from%20different%20angles%2C%20to%20the%20field%20of%20fundamental%20rights.%20As%20constitutional%20judge%2C%20he%20has%20been%20involved%20in%20the%20deliberations%20on%20three-hundred%20and%20fifteen%20judgments%20regarding%20appeals%20for%20protection%2C%20being%20rapporteur%20in%20forty-five%20of%20them.%20He%20has%20broad%20experience%20in%20the%20dialogue%20between%20the%20Constitutional%20Court%20and%20the%20European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights%20which%2C%20accordingly%2C%20proves%20his%20knowledge%20of%20the%20case%20law%20of%20both%20Courts.%20He%20has%20taken%20part%20in%20a%20number%20of%20encounters%20and%20meetings%20with%20European%20and%20Latin-American%20Constitutional%20Courts%2C%20having%20served%20as%20Permanent%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Latin-American%20Conference%20on%20Constitutional%20Justice.%20He%20has%20also%20taken%20part%20in%20various%20meetings%20of%20the%20Venice%20Commission.%0A%0AAccording%20to%20his%20academic%20profile%2C%20the%20expertise%20on%20human%20right%20comes%20from%20his%20doctoral%20thesis%20and%20covers%20a%20number%20of%20publications%2C%20mainly%20related%20to%20labour%20rights%20and%20its%20interaction%20with%20other%20fundamental%20rights.%0A%0AConsequently%2C%20the%20selection%20Committee%20submits%20to%20the%20Government%20the%20following%20list%20of%20candidates%20%E2%80%93%20in%20alphabetical%20order%2C%20as%20required%20by%20the%20applicable%20regulation%20%E2%80%93%20for%20election%20as%20Spanish%20judge%20to%20the%20European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights%3A%0A%0AEL%C3%93SEGUI%20ICHASO%2C%20MAR%C3%8DA%0AMART%C3%8DN%20Y%20P%C3%89REZ%20DE%20NANCLARES%2C%20JOS%C3%89%0AP%C3%89REZ%20DE%20LOS%20COBOS%20ORIHUEL%2C%20FRANCISCO%20DE%20AS%C3%8DS%0A%0ATHE%20PRESIDENT%2C%0A%0A%5BSignature%5D%0A%0AIldefonso%20Castro%20L%C3%B3pez%2C%20State%20Secretary%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%0A%0AMEMBER%20OF%20THE%20COMMITTEE%2C%0A%0A%5BSignature%5D%0A%0ACarmen%20S%C3%A1nchez-Cort%C3%A9s%20Mart%C3%ADn%2C%20State%20Secretary%20for%20Justice%0A%0AMEMBER%20OF%20THE%20COMMITTEE%2C%0A%0A%5BSignature%5D%0A%0A%C3%81urea%20Rold%C3%A1n%20Mart%C3%ADn%2C%20Undersecretary%20of%20Justice%0A%0AMEMBER%20OF%20THE%20COMMITTEE%2C%0A%0A%5BSignature%5D%0A%0AJos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Jover%20G%C3%B3mez-Ferre%2C%20Undersecretary%20of%20Presidency%20and%20Territorial%20Administration%0A%0AThe%20Council%20of%20Ministers%20Agreement%20dated%2025%20January%202017%2C%20in%20its%20published%20official%20version%2C%20along%20with%20its%20translation%20into%20French%20and%20English.%0A%0ABOLET%C3%8DN%20OFICIAL%20DEL%20ESTADO%20%0A%0ATuesday%2C%2031%20January%202017%0A%0AMINISTRY%20OF%20PRESIDENCY%20AND%20TERRITORIAL%20ADMINISTRATION%0A%

%20of%20the final decision are set forth.

It is worth pointing out, for these purposes, that high qualifications required from candidates for the post of judge at the Court, require a thorough, exhaustive selection process. It is therefore advisable that the three candidates proposed by the Council of Ministers should in general be able, before reaching the retirement age, to serve on the Court for all of the nine-year term of office for which they will be appointed by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

In the light of this background, the Council of Ministers has considered it appropriate to adopt some guidelines with a view to drafting the aforementioned list of candidates for the post of judge at the Court, in order to perform it whenever required.

In accordance with the power conferred by Article 97 of the Spanish Constitution, and within the exercise of their discretionary competence to submit a list of candidates to perform the highest international and jurisdictional functions, the final resolution shall correspond to the Council of Ministers by means of an agreement to submit it for further consideration by the Advisory Panel, prior to its referral to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

By virtue whereof, acting on the proposal of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Presidency and Territorial Administration, the Council of Ministers, at its meeting held on 20 January 2017, hereby

AGREE

First

Where, pursuant to the provisions set forth in the Convention, it proves necessary to propose candidates for the post of judge at the Court by the Kingdom of Spain, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation shall notify the need to adopt such decisions to the Ministers of Justice and Presidency and Territorial Administration and to the Executive Council on Foreign Policy, in order to produce a list of candidates in accordance with the provisions set out in this Agreement.

Second
