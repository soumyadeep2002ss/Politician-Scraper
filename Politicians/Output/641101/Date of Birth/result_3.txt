María Elósegui Itxaso (San Sebastián, 1957) [1] is a Basque jurist. He is Professor of Philosophy of Law at the University of Zaragoza. [2] She was the first woman to be nominated to be a judge in the European Court of Human Rights. [1]

When he sent his curriculum vitae to the European Court of Human Rights he lied to claim that he participated in the writing of the law for effective equality of women and men. [2] She denied such a fact. [3]

In January 2018 he became a judge of the European Court of Human Rights. [4] That month the Popular Party of La Rioja proposed it to elaborate a law of transsexuality. [5]

Thought [modifies]

It has linked homosexuality to diseases; He has stated that transsexuality is a disease that requires therapy, not surgery; He has negatively criticized the contraceptive pill and the condoms; and said that women die more when induced abortion is legalized. [6]

It is for this reason that on February 12, 2018 a group of 75 MEPs urged to revoke their appointment, by means of a joint letter. [7]

Prizes [modifies]

Has received the Luis Portero Prize for Human Rights. [8]
