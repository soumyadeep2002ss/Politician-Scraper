1 Sacked after disputes between the Government as he extended the Villa International Airport Maamigili lease to JP leader MP Qasim Ibrahim for 99 years.
2 Sacked after she strongly criticized the President and the Government, stating that her husband was beaten by the Police and his arrest was politically motivated, following the arrest of her husband MP Abdullah Jabir over suspicions of drinking alcohol. Prior to her dismissal, Media Secretary at the President's Office, Masood Imad told the press that she was dismissed because she acted in a manner not suited for a Minister.[6]
3 Sacked after he became the Running-mate of MP Abdulla Yameen, presidential candidate of PPM. Prior to his dismissal, Media Secretary at the President's Office, Masood Imad told the press that having a rival candidate's running-mate as the Home Minister would create a conflict of interest as the President himself is contesting in the presidential elections.[7]
4Dr. Abdul Samad Abdulla died early morning of Aug. 25, 2013 whilst receiving treatment in Singapore after he suffered from a critical kidney ailment. He was discharged from the Mount Elizabeth Hospital on Aug. 20, 2013 after undergoing dialysis. Butwas rushed to the hospital hours later after he suffered from heart complications resulting from the dialysis. He underwent a heart bypass surgery about 15 years ago. He died at the age of 67 and was survived by his wife and three children.
5 Lost the post as the Parliament passed a censure motion against her. The no-confidence motion was passed with the votes of 41 MPs accusing her of failing to protect state institutions and instead back the baseless allegations of a political party. She had been accused of advocating on behalf of JP after her office intervened in the case filed by the party at the Supreme Court seeking annulment of the first round of presidential elections held on 7 September 2013.
6 According to the Media Secretary at the President's Office, Masood Imad, Dr. Jamsheed resigned to take up a job at the WHO's Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO).
7 The Vice President's resignation came hours before the end of the presidential term, and after the country's last ditch attempt to elect a new president before the constitutional deadline of November 11 failed after the Supreme Court suspended the runoff which was slated for 10 November. Neither the Vice President nor the Government stated the cause of the resignation.
