the southern suburb of Córdoba led to the destruction of the place.[32] In the 10th and 11th centuries Córdoba was one of the most advanced cities in the world, and a great cultural, political, financial and economic centre.[33][34][35]

Córdoba had a prosperous economy, with manufactured goods including leather, metal work, glazed tiles and textiles, and agricultural produce including a range of fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and materials such as cotton, flax and silk.[36] It was also famous as a centre of learning, home to over 80 libraries and institutions of learning,[33][37] with knowledge of medicine, mathematics, astronomy, botany far exceeding the rest of Europe at the time.[36] Later, the vizier al-Mansur – the de facto ruler of al-Andalus from 976 to 1002 – burned most of the books on philosophy from the library of Caliph al-Hakam II to appease Maliki jurists (ulama); most of the others were sold off or perished in the civil strife not long after.[38][39]

After a period of weak central rule, Abd ar-Rahman III came to power as emir in 912 and campaigned lengthily and systematically to re-establish the authority of Córdoba across Al-Andalus. In 929, after years of military and diplomatic efforts, he felt confident enough to declare himself "caliph", a title challenging the Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad and the Fatimid caliphs in North Africa. This inaugurated the height of Córdoba's power and influence in the 10th century.[40][41] This century saw the construction of two palatine cities in the surroundings of Córdoba: Madīnat al-Zahrā to the west, built by Abd ar-Rahman III, and another one built later by al-Mansur (Medina Alzahira [es]) to the east.[42] The economic historian J. Bradford DeLong estimates the city's population at 400,000 around 1000 AD,[10] while estimates from other historians range from 100,000 to 1,000,000 during the same era.[43] Whatever Córdoba's population was, the city's apogee came to an abrupt halt after the 1009 crisis.[44]

On 15 February 1009, with Hisham II as caliph and Sanchuelo as hajib (and de facto ruler), a revolution broke out in Córdoba, which led to the proclamation of an alternative caliph.[45] This marked the beginning of a long period of civil war and conflict in Al-Andalus known as the Fitna. Berbers entered and sacked Córdoba in May 1013.[46] Hisham III was routed from Córdoba on 30 November 1031 and an oligarchic republic replaced the caliphate.[47][48]

High and Late Middle Ages[edit]

Under rule of the Banu Yahwar, Cordobese power did not extend far from the city, as other independent polities emerged in the rest of the former caliphate.[44][49] An estimation of 65,000 inhabitants has been proposed for 11th-century Córdoba.[50]

In 1070, forces from the Abbadid Taifa of Seville entered Córdoba to help in the defence of the city, that had been besieged by Al-Mamun, ruler of Toledo, yet they took control and expelled the last ruler of the taifa of Córdoba, Abd-Al Malik, forcing him to exile.[51] Al-Mamun did not cease in his efforts to take the city, and making use of a Sevillian renegade who murdered the Abbadid governor, he triumphantly entered the city on 15 February 1075, only to die there barely five months later, apparently poisoned.[52]: 40  Córdoba was seized by force in March 1091 by the Almoravids.[53] In 1121, the population revolted against the abuses of the Almoravid governor.[54]

Sworn enemies of the Almohads, Ibn Mardanīš (the "Wolf King") and his stepfather Ibrahim Ibn Hamusk allied with Alfonso VIII of Castile and laid siege on Córdoba by 1158–1160, ravaging the surroundings but failing to take the city.[55]

Almohad caliph Abdallah al-Adil appointed Al-Bayyasi [es] (brother of Zayd Abu Zayd) as governor of Córdoba in 1224, only to see the later became independent from Caliphal rule.[56] Al-Bayyasi asked Ferdinand III of Castile for help and Córdoba revolted against him.[57] Years later, in 1229, the city submitted to the authority of Ibn Hud,[58] disavowing him in 1233, joining instead the territories under Muhammad Ibn al-Aḥmar,[59] ruler of Arjona and soon-to-be emir of Granada.

Ferdinand III entered the city on 29 June 1236, following a siege of several months. According to Arab sources, Córdoba fell on 23 Shawwal 633 (that is, on 30 June 1236, a day later than Christian tradition).[60] Upon the city's conquest the mosque was converted into a Catholic cathedral dedicated to the Virgin Mary (Santa Maria).[61][62] This was also followed by the return to Santiago de Compostela of the church bells that had been looted by Almanzor and moved to Córdoba by Christian war prisoners in the late 10th century.[63] Ferdinand III granted the city a fuero in 1241;[64] it was based on the Liber Iudiciorum and in the customs of Toledo, yet formulated in an original way.[65] Unlike the case of other kingdoms of the Crown of Castile, the wider Kingdom of Córdoba distinctly lacked realengo (royal demesne) council towns other than the capital city itself.[66] In addition, the military orders had a comparatively lesser presence across the realm.[67] The city was divided into 14 colaciones,[citation needed] and numerous new church buildings were added.

By the end of the 13th century, the land belonging to the council of Córdoba peaked at about 12,000 km2.[68] It progressively reduced upon creation of new lordships, amounting to about 9,000 km2 by the end of the middle ages.[68]

The city's surrounding countryside was raided during the 1277–78 Marinid expedition in the Guadalquivir valley.[69] In 1282, in the context of the problematic succession of Alfonso X of Castile, an army formed by the latter's supporters as well as Marinid forces laid siege to the city (where prince Sancho was) for 21 days.[70][71][72] The city council had indeed joined a newly created brotherhood in 1282 together with other councils of the Upper Guadalquivir defending Sancho's dynastic rights against Alfonso's regal authoritarianism.[73]

Many decades after during the Third Siege of Gibraltar in 1333, a diversionary Granadian army raided the countryside of Cordoba and encamped on the far side of the Roman Bridge of Cordoba. However the diversionary army had to return to Gibraltar to help their Marinid counterparts so no further action was taken.[74] In 1368, during the Castilian Civil War, the city, loyal to the Trastámara side, was attacked by forces supporting of Peter I, with Granadan backing.[75]

Modern history[edit]

In the context of the Early Modern Period, the city experienced a golden age between 1530 and 1580, profiting from an economic activity based on the trade of agricultural products and the preparation of clothes originally from Los Pedroches, peaking at a population of about 50,000 by 1571.[76] A period of stagnation and ensuing decline followed.[76]

%0A%0AC%C3�rdoba has a hot Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa).[93] It has the highest summer average daily temperatures in Spain and Europe (with highs averaging 36.9 °C (98 °F) in July) and days with temperatures over 40 °C (104 °F) are common in the summer months. August's 24-hour average of 28.0 °C (82 °F) is also one of the highest in Europe, despite relatively cool nightly temperatures.[94] On average, Córdoba has 16 days with maximum temperatures over 40 °C (104 °F) and 68 days with maximum temperatures over 35 °C (95 °F).[95] In July 2022, there were 19 days with highs over 40 °C (104 °F) and 30 days with highs over 35 °C (95 °F), with the average high of 40.4 °C (104.7 °F) for that month, which is the highest ever recorded in Spain and Europe.[96][97]

Winters are mild, yet cooler than other low lying cities in southern Spain due to its interior location, wedged between the Sierra Morena and the Penibaetic System. Precipitation is concentrated in the coldest months; this is due to the dry summer climate pattern featured in large parts of the Iberian Peninsula. Precipitation is generated by storms from the west that occur most frequently from December to February. This Atlantic characteristic then gives way to a hot summer with significant drought more typical of Mediterranean climates. Annual rain surpasses 600 mm (24 in), although it is recognized to vary from year to year.

The registered maximum temperature at the Córdoba Airport, located at 6 kilometres (4 miles) from the city, was 46.9 °C (116.4 °F) on 13 July 2017 and 14 August 2021.[98] The lowest registered temperature was −8.2 °C (17.2 °F), on 28 January 2005.[99]

Landmarks[edit]
View of the Historic centre of Córdoba from the Guadalquivir River

The historic centre of Córdoba has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1994.[a][88]

Roman[edit]
Roman Mausoleum in the Paseo de la Victoria

The Roman Bridge, over the Guadalquivir River, links the area of Campo de la Verdad with Barrio de la Catedral. It was the only bridge of the city for twenty centuries, until the construction of the San Rafael Bridge in the mid-20th century. It was initially built in the early 1st century BC during the reign of emperor Augustus but significantly rebuilt in the 8th century under Umayyad rule. It has a length of about 250 m and has 16 arches.[101]

Other Roman remains include the Roman Temple, the Theatre, Mausoleum, the Colonial Forum, the Forum Adiectum, an amphitheater and the remains of the Palace of Emperor Maximian in the archaeological site of Cercadilla.[102]

Islamic[edit]
Great Mosque of Córdoba[edit]
Main article: Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba
Interior of the Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba

From 784- 786 AD, Abd al-Rahman I built the Great Mosque of Córdoba, one of the most famous monuments of Western Islamic (Moorish) architecture.[103][104][105] It integrated aspects of Islamic architecture with some indigenous elements of Roman and Visigothic architecture.[62] Later Umayyad rulers expanded the mosque, adding a minaret and extending the prayer hall. A major 10th-century expansion resulted in the elaborate mihrab and other ornate embellishments seen today.[62] After the Christian conquest of the city the mosque was converted to a cathedral. It underwent significant modifications in the 16th century but much of the original structure remains.[62] The building was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1984.[88]

Minaret of San Juan[edit]

Built in 930 AD, the mosque that this minaret adorned has been replaced by a church and the minaret re-purposed as a tower. It retains characteristics of Islamic architecture in the region, including a double horseshoe-arch windows.[104][106]

Mills of the Guadalquivir[edit]
The Tower of Calahorra to one side of the Roman Bridge

Along the banks of the Guadalquivir are the Mills of the Guadalquivir, an array of watermills from different periods that used the power of the water current to grind flour. They include the Albolafia, Alegría watermill, Carbonell, Casillas, Enmedio, Lope García, Martos, Pápalo, San Antonio, San Lorenzo and San Rafael mills.[107][additional citation(s) needed]

Calahorra Tower[edit]

The Calahorra is a fortified tower standing at the southern end of the city's Roman Bridge. Its original construction is attributed to the Almohad period.[108][109] It now houses the Al-Andalus Living Museum (Museo Vivo de Al-Andalus), a museum on the cultural achievements of Al-Andalus.[110][111]

Caliphal Baths[edit]
Main article: Caliphal Baths

Near the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos, on the site of the former Islamic-era Alcázar, are the Caliphal Baths, a partly-reconstructed hammam (baths) complex created in the 10th century and subsequently expanded. The archeological site has been open as a museum since 2006.[112][113]

Medina Azahara[edit]
Main article: Madinat al-Zahra

On the outskirts of the city lies the archaeological site of Madinat al-Zahra, the 10th-century palace-city. It is another major example of Islamic architecture in Spain and has been undergoing excavation and reconstruction since 1911.[114]

Jewish Quarter[edit]
Calleja de las Flores, with the Great Cathedral in the background
Main article: Judería de Córdoba

Near the cathedral is the old Jewish quarter, which consists of many irregular streets that preserve some of the city's medieval aspect.[106] It contains a museum, the Sepharad House,[115][116] and the Synagogue, built in 1315.[117]

Surrounding the large Old town are the Roman walls: gates include the Puerta de Almodóvar, the Puerta de Sevilla and Puerta del Puente, which are the only three gates remaining from the original thirteen. Towers and fortresses include the Malmuerta Tower, Torre de Belén and the Puerta del Rincón's Tower.

In the south of the Old town and east of the great cathedral, in the Plaza del Potro, is the Posada del Potro, a row of inns mentioned in literary works including Don Quixote and La Feria de los Discretos, and which remained active until 1972. Both the plaza and the inn get their name from the fountain in the centre of the plaza, which represents a foal (potro). Not far from this plaza is the Arco del Portillo (a 14th-century arch). In the extreme southwest of the Old Town is the Alcázar de los Reyes Cristianos, a former royal property and the seat of the Inquisition; adjacent to it are the Royal Stables, where Andalusian horses are bred. Palace buildings in the Old Town include the Palacio de Viana (14th century) and the Palacio de la Merced among others. Other sights include the Cuesta del Bailío (a staircase connecting the upper and lower part of the city).

Fernandine churches[edit]

The city is home to 12 Christian churches that were built (many as transformations of mosques) by Ferdinand III of Castile after the reconquest of the city in the 13th century. They were to act both as churches and as the administrative centres in the neighborhoods into which the city was divided in medieval times. Some of those that remain are:

Iglesia de Santa Marina de Aguas Santas, built in the 13th century
San Nicolás de la Villa.
San Miguel.
San Juan y Todos los Santos (also known as Iglesia de la Trinidad).
Santa Marina de Aguas Santas.
San Agustín. Begun in 1328, it has now an 18th-century appearance. The façade bell tower, with fOur bells, DATES to the 16th Century.
San Andrés, Largely Renovated in the 14th and 15th centuries. It has a Renaissance Portal (1489) and a bell tower from the same period, while the high altar is a baroque work by Pedro Duque Cornejo.
San Lorenzo.
Church of Santiago.
San Pedro.
Santa María Magdalena. Like the others, it combines Romanesque, Mudéjar and Gothic Elements.
St. Paul. In the Church's Garden in the 1990s the ruins of anncient Roman circus were discovered.[118]
Other Religious Structures[edits]

Museums[edit]
Magdalena by Julio Romero de Torres

The Archaeological and Ethnological Museum of Córdoba is a provincial museum located near the Guadalquivir River.[123] The museum was officially opened in 1867 and shared space with the Museum of Fine Arts until 1920. In 1960, the museum was relocated to the Renaissance Palace of Páez de Castillo where it remains to present day. The Archaeological and Ethnological Museum has eight halls which contain pieces from the middle to late Bronze Age, to Roman culture, Visigothic art, and Islamic culture.[124]

The Julio Romero de Torres Museum is located next to the Guadalquivir and was opened in November 1931.[125] The home of Julio Romero de Torres, has undergone many renovations and been turned into a museum and it has also been home to several other historical institutions such as the Archaeological Museum (1868-1917) and the Museum of Fine Arts. Many of the works include paintings and motifs done by Julio Romero de Torres himself.[126]

The Fine Arts Museum of Córdoba is located next to the Julio Romero de Torres Museum which it shares a courtyard with.[127] The building originally was for the old Hospital for Charity but after that the building went under many renovations and renewals to become the renaissance style building it is today.[128][129] The Museum of Fine Arts contains many works from the baroque period, medieval renaissance art, work from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, drawings, mannerist art and other unique works.[130]

The Diocesan Museum is located in the Córdoba's Episcopal Palace which was built upon the former Umayyad alcázar. The collection within houses many paintings, sculptures and furniture.[131]

Another museum within Córdoba are the Caliphal Baths.

Festivals[edit]
Interior patio during the Courtyards Festival of Córdoba - World Heritage

Tourism is especially intense in Córdoba during May as this month hosts three of the most important annual festivals in the city:[132]

Las Cruces de Mayo (The May Crosses of Córdoba).[133] This festival takes place at the beginning of the month. During three or four days, crosses of around 3m height are placed in many squares and streets and decorated with flowers and a contest is held to choose the most beautiful one. Usually there is regional food and music near the crosses.
Los Patios de Córdoba (The Courtyards Festival of Córdoba - World Heritage).[134] This festival is celebrated during the second and third week of the month. Many houses of the historic center open their private patios to the public and compete in a contest. Both the architectonic value and the floral decorations are taken into consideration to choose the winners. It is usually very difficult and expensive to find accommodation in the city during the festival.
La Feria de Córdoba (The Fair of Córdoba).[135] This festival takes place at the end of the month and is similar to the better known Seville Fair with some differences, mainly that the Sevilla Fair has majority private casetas (tents run by local businesses), while the Córdoba Fair has majority public ones.
