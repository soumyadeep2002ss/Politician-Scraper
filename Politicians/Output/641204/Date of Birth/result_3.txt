FAQs ABOUT GIGI STUDIOS

Who is GIGI Studios? We are a young brand, created by a dynamic, international team, with head offices in Barcelona, where we design our collections. Our main aim is to offer a high quality, sophisticated product that brings together aesthetics and functionality.
What inspires our designs? Our design team is inspired by art and by the latest trends, always aimed at creating a unique product, with passion for the details.
How can I contact GIGI Studios? You can contact us by email hello@gigistudios.com or directly by filling in the following form. ABOUT THE PRODUCT
How can I find my nearest GIGI Studios optician? You can access our Store Locator by entering your post code and town and our system will show you the opticians that are nearest to you. You will also find authorised points of sale in the option. Find your optician on each product data sheet.
Is the case included? You will receive a case, a protective sleeve, a cleaning cloth and a warranty certificate with your glasses.
Will I receive the same product I have seen in the photo? Yes. Our website has the latest photographic system to ensure that what you see is exactly what you receive. However, there may be minimal differences that do not affect the product’s essential characteristics.
How can I find out if an article is out of stock and becomes available again? We will be delighted to keep you up to date! Therefore, you can enter your email address on the data sheet of each article that is temporarily out of stock and you will receive a notification when the product is available in our warehouse again.
How can I find out if an article is out of stock and becomes available again? Our products have been produced using top quality materials, but they must still be treated with care to ensure their durability. Cleaning hints: The glasses are accompanied by a microfiber cloth with which you can clean them frequently. You may also use a fine cotton cloth that will absorb the grease well and prevent them from becoming scratched. Never use rough materials – such as a paper towel, as this has abrasive properties. If necessary, you can wash with water and a drop of very gentle soap; rinse them well and dry them using the same cloth. Never use alcohol, strong detergents or dissolvent. Avoid leaving them in places where they might be exposed to high temperatures, such as inside a car in the sunlight.
To what extent do they protect me from the sun? The sun lenses that we use are high range CR39, comfortable and safe. Thanks to their high optical quality they provide clear vision with a high absorption level of U.V.A and U.V.B. rays. Many of our models also have polarized filters that offer anti-glare protection. You will find this information in the product description on the box. ORDERING INFO
