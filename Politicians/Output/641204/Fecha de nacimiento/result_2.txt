About

"Galicia has always had wings. It has always been prone to crossing borders, touring the world as an Ícaro affected by the cultures that settled in the Iberian Peninsula. Still rooted in the villages or the seafront, Galicia raised the flight." The words of the writer Nélida Piñón in the catalog of the exhibition Galicia, a story in the world summarizes the spirit of a sample, and of a work, that tell us about paths and crossroads, encounters and disagreements, adventures and a story forged for millennia. With the symbol of the Galician people who reached the heart of the Roman Empire, the Caetra or a small circular shield that carries the iconic warrior of the Castro de Lesenho, starts this work: an exciting sequence of matches around the four cardinal points. North, south, east and west are precisely the titles of the four blocks that articulate the different specialized texts through which the reader can thematically travel the more than 300 pieces collected in the exhibition along its 278 pages.
