Adapt at structuring my course and extremely organized , I have added value to my students through my easy going approach with Students from 90 different countries.

My greatest strengths being: collaborative leadership, strategic planning, empowering the students to develop their leadership and instructional skills, independent academic program development in Spanish and leadership. I foster strong and facilitate integration of initiatives designed to enhance the class and school environment.

With experience working at primary, middle and secondary school levels, as well as in activities outside of the traditional classroom, I have a diverse background with much to offer. In me, you'll find someone who is dedicated, self-motivated, and who possesses the detail-orientation and technical skills to excel in a challenging environment. My most recent background, encompassing exposure to collaborative planning to enhance Qualitative Teaching across subject verticals, would be additional assets. My skill set also prominently features the ability to organize and manage multiple projects with a number of participants and the ability to collaborate effectively within a team while sharing information that contributes to our growth and the success of our students.
