Abstract 
This report provides an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of posting in Italy. Data availability improved  in recent years 
and this allows to highlight the specific features of posting and try to explain why this phenomenon, despite increasing public 
attention, does not figure prominently in the debate about working conditions and terms of employment in Italy. The analysis of 
the regulatory and legislative framework identifies some remaining weaknesses which can hinder the effective enforcement of 
EU Directive 2018/957/EU amending Directive 96/71/EC.
