SUMMARY
Director of the Office II technical-scientific activities for the provision and prevention of risks,
of the Department of Civil Protection, Presidency of the Council of Ministers. Manager of
Research of the National Research Council (CNR), from September 2009 to November 2019,
Director (or Director of F.F.) of the research institute for hydrogeological protection (IRPI) of
CNR. Graduated in Geological Sciences at the University of Perugia (1983) with a thesis in
Structural geology, I got a Ph.D. in Geography from the University of Bonn (2006) with
A thesis entitled Landslide Hazard and Risk Assessment. In 1985-1986 I was at the U.S.
Geological Survey, Menlo Park, where I worked on the creation of inventory cards of
Small scale landslides under the guidance of Dr. Earl E. Brabb. From 1992 to 2002 I coordinated the
AVI project: Italian vulnerate areas of the CNR Gndci, producing a vast archive
of information relating to landslides and historical floods in Italy. I participated in several projects
Europeans, including Damocles, E2-C2, Eurorisk-Preview and Riskaware. I was responsible
scientific of the Morfeo project of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) for the use of data e
Earth observation technologies for the identification and mapping of the landslides, for the
monitoring of landslide movements, and for the forecast of the instability. I coordinated the projects
European FP7 Doris: Ground Deformations Risk Scenarios: An Advanced Assessment Service, for
the use of earth's observation technologies for monitoring landslides e
Subsididenza phenomena, and FP7 Lampre: Landslide Modeling and Tools for Vulnerability
Assessment Preparedness and Recovery Management. For the National Department of
Civil Protection I coordinated a research project for the forecast of landslides induced by
rainfall and for the assessment of the risk of landslides. I was president of Natural
Hazards Division of the European Geosciences Union (Egu), of which I was founder, and
from which he received the Egu Union Service Award (2008) and Soloviev Medal (2021). Founder
of the international magazine Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences (Nhess), I was
Member of the Apartory Board (2001-2015), and Executive Editor of the magazine (2007-2013). I was
the coordinator of the technical and scientific activities carried out by the CNR in the area affected by
L'Aquila earthquake of 604/2009. From April 2009 to May 2010 I was responsible
The only one of the National Defense Group from the hydrogeological catastrophes (Gndci) of the CNR.
I was a member of the National Commission for the provision and prevention of
Great risks (2012-2019), and member of the Gev04 for the quality assessment of the
Research (VQR 2011-2014). I obtained the national scientific qualification to the functions of
University professor of first Fax, competition sector 04/A3. I worked in several
Research sectors in geomorphology, applied geology, geology and geo-information, among which:
(i) Identification and mapping of the landslides in different climatic, geological environments and
morphological, (ii) analysis of the type and spatial distribution of the instability in relation to
geological and structural conditions, (III) development of methods for the determination of the
susceptibility and the danger of landslides, (IV) temporal forecast of the instability, using
Historical-Cronachistic information and Multi-temporal inventory cards, (V) study of
Frequency distributions of the size of the failure, (VI) acquisition and use of
Historical information on landslides and floods for the assessment of danger and risk
geo-hydrological, (VII) definition of landslide vulnerability, (VIII) definition and mapping of the
landslide risk, including the assessment of social and individual risk, (IX) definition of
rain and hydrological thresholds for the possible trigger of landslide phenomena, (x) morphometry
General, (XI) application of GIS and Web-Gis technologies for the analysis and publication of
geomorphological information, and (XII) dissemination of information on danger, the
vulnerability and geo-hydrological risk. I am the author of over 130 articles in international magazines,
Ten chapters of books, over 100 articles in documents of international or national conferences, eleven cards
issues, over 200 communications to international and national conferences, and I took care of ten
Special numbers of international magazines.
