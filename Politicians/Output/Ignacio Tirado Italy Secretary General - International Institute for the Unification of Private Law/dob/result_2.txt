Wonderful to see Prof. Ignacio Tirado, Secretary General of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) again after all these years. Grazie Mille to the Consulate General of Italy Hong Kong for a really enjoyable evening.

Each year, White Collar Fighter presents the Barbara Sullivan Award to the highest charity fund raiser of the year. Thank you once again to Grant Sullivan and the White Collar Fighter organizers for presenting me with such a beautiful trophy and framed action shot. What a journey its been and an experience of a lifetime. So blessed to be able to say that raising GBP30,000 has made me the highest charity fund raiser in the history of White Collar Fighter. 💫

3 fights, 2 wins, a title belt and over GBP30,000 raised for charity. I feel so grateful for all the love, support and encouragement. Thank you to all my family, friends and clients for all your generous donations. Thank you to the organizers, coaches and staff of White Collar Fighter and to my amazing coach, @tomas__ferenc, I wouldn't have been able to go through this amazing journey without you. Thank you @sullyphotograph for presenting me with this beautiful trophy in honour of your dearest mother and framed shot of me in action. Retiring gracefully but you will all be in my hearts. ❤️❤️❤️

2012 (Winner of the IFS Vanda White Collar Boxing, Hong Kong) 2023 (White Collar Fighter Title Belt Champion and highest charity fund raiser in the history of White Collar, Manchester UK). Will I be 3rd time lucky in the Undisputed Belt Fight on 9th September? I have trained as hard as my body could and can endure. I don't think I am doing too bad for a 45 year old lady. 🤣🤣🤣 I cannot thank my family and friends enough for all the love and support you have given me during some of my toughest times. A special thank you always to my amazing coach @tomas__ferenc. Your unwavering support, words of encouragement, lifting me up when all I could do is tear up and break down have meant the world to me and I am so grateful for all that you have done to get me fight fit. You have put me through all the paces and been such a valuable part of my white collar journey. Hearing you say how proud you are of me really touched my core. I shall endeavor to do my best to keep making you proud.Thank you Coach❤💛 https://lnkd.in/eKWggRQj I have now surpassed the amount I raised in my previous fight. Last push to get to GBP12,888 which is my lucky goal. I can only do that with all your support so I would be grateful if you could kindly donate to my chosen charity, World Child Cancer Charity. Link is above. For those interested in coming to watch, it will be one of the biggest White Collar events ever and will take place at the Bowlers Exhibition Centre in Manchester. I still have a few tickets left so please DM me for the specs and details. 😊 Dad always used to say, if there is a will, there will always be a way. I got this 👊🏼🙏💫❤️ Thank you. Love & Light, Selma

WCF 146 Manchester WHITE COLLAR FIGHTER MANCHESTER💗 https://lnkd.in/eKWggRQj Many of you who already know me well know that I had recently won the White Collar Fighter Title Belt and became the highest charity fund raiser in the history of WCF by raising GBP10K for my chosen charity Save the Children International. Time flies when you are fighting fit and training hard🥰😍🤩4 weeks till the undisputed belt fight. Despite how tough things have been over the past couple of months, I remain focused and determined and I cannot thank my family and friends enough for all the love and support. My goal is to raise even more money for the World Child Cancer Charity and I hope you can all support me by giving a small donation so that I can reach my goal. Link is above.

WCF 146 Manchester WHITE COLLAR FIGHTER MANCHESTER💗 https://lnkd.in/eKWggRQj Many of you who already know me well know that I had recently won the White Collar Fighter Title Belt at the first instance in my first fight in the UK (2nd in total, the first being in 2012 in Hong Kong) and became the highest charity fund raiser in the history of WCF by raising GBP10K for my chosen charity Save the Children International. I have decided to take on the challenge and train for the undisputed belt and shall endeavor to raise even more money for another charity I hold close to my heart. World Child Cancer is the leading international children's charity dedicated to addressing the global inequality in childhood cancer care. Their vision is a world where every child with cancer has equal access to treatment and care. Their mission is to improve diagnosis, treatment and support for children with cancer, and their families, in low and middle-income countries around the world. Many of you who already know me well know that one of the most important values my parents engraved in me was to be a person with integrity and empathy and to be in a position to be able to give back to the community that blessed and gifted me with such an amazing childhood.  I will train hard, fight hard and most importantly, the journey will be yet another wonderful reminder that if there is a will, there will always be a way. Thank you. Much love, Selma xo My birthday wish would be to raise even more this time so I hope you can all support me with a small donation. 🥰
