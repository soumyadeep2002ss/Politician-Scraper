2. Areas of scientific interest 
 
Coral ecology and biology: demography, growth rates and population dynamics patterns in 
temperate and tropical corals and their relationships with environmental factors; growth and 
population dynamics modeling; the role of boring organisms in bioerosion of corals and coral reefs; 
effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on coral reef communities; modular growth and 
predictable patterns of colony and population growth; sexual and asexual reproduction; population 
genetic structure and connectivity; planula larval behaviour and metamorphosis; morphology of

gametogenesis; reef community structure; life history strategies; conservation ecology and 
management of coral reef; global climate change and its effect on temperate and tropical coral-reef 
communities; the use of contemporary corals in predictive models concerning with global climate 
change. 
Citizen Science: university research, industry, and policy interdisciplinary interactions; 
international cooperation; volunteers in research; marine conservation monitoring; sustainable 
tourism; biodiversity monitoring, recreational activities, education, scientific literacy and 
naturalistic awareness. 
Microgravity biomineralization: biomaterialsfor biomimetic scaffolds; biomineralized tissues; 
biomineralizing organisms; biominerals; calcification; corals; genetic and environmental control on 
biomineralization; marine mineralization; material research; mechanical and biogenic properties of 
biomaterials; porosity; space bioreactor.
