Scientific profile
Scientific and research interests are oriented towards the issues of environmental technological design, with
particular reference to the dynamics of innovation in the production process of the project induced by the new ones
organizational logic of the construction sector and the update of the legislative framework regarding quality
environmental. Studies and application experiments therefore develop insights referring to the aspects
regulations, procedural and techno-pypological, with the aim of governing multi-commissioner determinations and
multidisciplinary of the environmental project of complex building interventions and in contexts of urban redevelopment and
building.
Project innovation and new environmental technologies constitute areas of significant interest and topicality,
also in relation to the new and complex interdisciplinary connections of the design activity; the variables
"Quality" and "environment" have in fact determined a significant dilation of the building process, redefining i
contents of the project to all stairs, in relation to technological innovation factors and new needs of
control of the results of the interventions and effects from these induced on the environment. The centrality of the issues
of the redevelopment, recovery and maintenance of the built, with the enhancement of cultural, environmental assets
and landscapes, therefore urges a new project offer based on integrated multidisciplinary skills,
To support complex decision -making and social processes.
The development of this knowledge is located within the debate undertaken by the ICAR/12 SSD in relation to
renewal needs of disciplinary statutes for the formation of the architect, with significant repercussions for
as regards the updating of the skills of the designers and the definition of the training courses
The new didactic systems are structured. Also with contributions deriving from application experimentation activities
aimed at preparing instruments and operating devices.
Research interests are consistently testified by participation in commissions and scientific committees,
from the collaboration with research groups of national and international relevance, as well as by the Management e
coordination of numerous initiatives in the scientific and didactic fields, and with participation as
Speaker at conferences, seminars and workshops, including international ones.
Publicity activities reflects and documents research interests, with particular attention to possible
interconnections between the issues and disciplinary approaches of architecture technology and size
environmental project at the various stairs, for the scientific diffusion of the results and with transfer objectives
of methodological and operational tools for the control of the design process in the different levelsi of the
training.
