Joan-Anton Sanchez de Juan

2001, eui phd theses; Department of History and Civilization. European University Institute, Florence

"The city of society is the community, called from the citizens, that is from the city of [for the inhabitants of the city and contains the lives]. For the city, the city, but the stones are called." Saint Isidore of Seville, etymologiarum, 15, 2, 1 "le vrai sens de ce mot s'est presque entierement efface chez les moderns; La plupart prennent une ville pour une citoyen.

Remembering and forgetting the Ancient City

A basic newly: The idea of the ancient city, the ninth-century book Pontifical, and Civic thought in Early Medieval Italy

2022 •

Thomas Langley

Civic Traditions were vibrant in Early Medieval Italy, as the Common states, transactions of bishops and a number of other genres Reveal. These texts Drew on the Civic Model established in late antiquity and represent an evolution rather than a break with ancient traditions. Yet scholars often View Late Antiquity or the Early Middle Ages as Witnessing the End of the Ancient Civic Tradition. Ecclesiastical influence is often taken as the key distinguishing feature: namely that (a) the city of earth was replaced by the city of the contemporary thought and thus that (b) Individuals came to identify with their church rather than their city, with patriotism toward the latter more or less complementely eclipsed. Yet the ancient and medieval cities can not be so readily separated. An ambrose or an Augustine might have ardently washed for the city of earthly to be eclipsed by the city, but such a project was never completely realized. Rather, 1 will argue that although the interests of church and city were identified, one did not replace the other. Indeed, writers rejoiced in Rich Church, virtuous bishops and prosperous flocks as signs of a flourishing city, country and city. Explicitly City-Focused Terms Like these evidence the concem of their users with the city itself, and thus with civic ideas, although i will argue that such concerns can be inferred even when these terms are not used explicitly.

Reminder: CFP - Friars in Motion: Mendicant orders and Urban Development (1200-1500), EAUH2020

Catarina Almeida Marado, Gianmario Guidarelli

Specialist session: S-Urb-1 | Friars in Motion: Mendicant Orders and Urban Development (1200-1500) The Purpose of the Session is to study the Urban, architectural, social and economic consequences that the arrival of the beggant orders involved in the European cities of the Middle Ages. The development of the city, in fact, is profoundly influenced by the establishment of convents in the suburbs, where the new "Borghi" develop. The "Crown" of Convents Around the Center of the City Forms a "belt" of Urban Hubfrom which new neighborhoods develop, but also a place for the exchange of ideas and people. In fact, the friar moves from one city to another, importing ideas, styles of preaching, social issues. For this reason, the convent is an important place of passage. Moreover, the convent is an open space that functions as a place of study, but also as a place of welcome for the masses of the poor who come from their companions and for the pilgrims who use it as a stop on their journey. The session proposes to explore all these aspects of the role of convents in the Medieval and Early Modern city, considered as a place of interchange between cultures - even artistic- and people, in a multidisciplinary and international perspective. They are invited to present proposals of different historical disciplines (topics on built environment, on artistic and architectural history, on religious, economic, social subjects connect to urban history) aimed at investigating the theme proposed in the session. In particular, we believe it is useful to start a debate regarding some urban phenomena triggered by the convents of the mendicant orders and verify their actual consequences on the urban structure and architectural solutions adopted, starting from some specific cases. In this way, we aim to verify how a phenomenon on a European scale can interact with individual local cases, both in big cities and in small villages. Organizers: Silvia Beltramo, Politecnico di Torino, Catarina Almeida Marado, University of Coimbra, Gianmario Guidarelli, Università di Padova.
