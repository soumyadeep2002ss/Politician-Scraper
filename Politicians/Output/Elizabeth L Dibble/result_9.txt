Elizabeth L. Dibble is, since August 2022, the Director General of the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO). Headquartered in Rome, the MFO is an international peacekeeping organization, created by agreement between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the State of Israel.

Formerly Carnegie’s chief operating officer, Dibble worked closely with the president to oversee and manage all aspects of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In addition to directly overseeing the finance and human resources and administration departments, Dibble assisted the president in managing Carnegie’s relationship with its board of trustees.

Dibble was named one of 100 top global thinkers by Foreign Policy magazine in 2011 and was awarded a Presidential Meritorious Service Award in 2009. She has a BS from Georgetown University’s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service and studied at the Pontificia Universidade Catolica in Campinas, Brazil.

In a fireside chat, Amr Hamzawy, director of the Carnegie Middle East Program and a Carnegie senior fellow, will discuss, with Dibble, the history and significance of the peacekeeping mission on the Egyptian-Israeli border. Their conversation will cover the interaction between the mission and the local environment in Egypt, the role of the United States in facilitating the peacekeeping mission, and the legacy of both Republican and Democratic administrations supporting it, as well as other lessons learned from the region.

Join us on Wednesday, December 7 from 05:30 to 06:00 PM EET for this fireside chat with Elizabeth Dibble and Amr Hamzawy. The discussion will be held in English and live-streamed on YouTube and Facebook.
