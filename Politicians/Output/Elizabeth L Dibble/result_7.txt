Sinai: MFO Director General visits 10th Coastal Naval Group
written by Italian Defence Technologies 11 Gennaio 2023

On January 5, 2023, at the Tenth Coastal Naval Group in Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt), the Commander of the Italian Contingent, Frigate Captain Carlo Saverio D’Apote received the Director General of the Multinational Force & Observers (MFO), Ms. Elizabeth L.  Dibble, in the presence of the MFO Force Commander, Maj. Gen.  Evan G. Williams.

The visit began inside the headquarters of the Coastal Patrol Unit where the 78 Italian soldiers engaged in the MFO peace mission operate, both on land and on board the 3 units of the ‘Esploratore’ class, baptized precisely the “Ships of the Desert”.

During the visit, the Director General had the opportunity to participate in a patrol activity on board the ‘Staffetta’ ship in the Strait of Tiran, Red Sea, in the Gulf of Aqaba, and touch the activity carried out by the Italian Contingent, the only maritime component of the MFO, which last year celebrated the fortieth anniversary of participation in the peace mission. At the end of the visit, the Director-General expressed his appreciation for Italy’s valuable contribution to the Multinational Force & Observers peace mission, recognizing once again the versatility and strategic value of the naval instrument available to the organization that has continued to fulfill the primary mission of guaranteeing freedom of navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea,  in support of local authorities and to protect the marine environment.
