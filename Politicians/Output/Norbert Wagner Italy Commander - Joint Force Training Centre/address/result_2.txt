Supported by experts in the field of Human Security and Women, Peace, and Security, the #JFTC Grey Cell enables LOLE24 to safely immerse the Training Audience in realistic scenarios requiring them to navigate dilemmas they would likely encounter under Article 5. A detailed civil picture has been developed as the foundational layer of LOLE24 that will highlight the interconnected nature of the human terrain and the warfighter in the European Theater.
