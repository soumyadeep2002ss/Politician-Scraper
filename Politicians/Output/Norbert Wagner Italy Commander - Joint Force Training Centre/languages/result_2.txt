Scripting workshop for #NATO Exercise LOYAL LEDA 2024 in progress. 
Supported by experts in the field of Human Security and Women, Peace, and Security, the #JFTC Grey Cell enables LOLE24 to safely immerse the Training Audience in realistic scenarios requiring them to navigate dilemmas they would likely encounter under Article 5. A detailed civil picture has been developed as the foundational layer of LOLE24 that will highlight the interconnected nature of the human terrain and the warfighter in the European Theater. The strength of our Alliance is our People!Â
