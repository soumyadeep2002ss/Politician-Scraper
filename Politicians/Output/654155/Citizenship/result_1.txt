Of
Brothers of Italy,
Italy has awakened,
of the Scipio helmet
Her head has surrounded.
Where's the victory?
Give her hair,
that slave of Rome
God created it.
Rit. Tighten us to cohort,
we are ready to die.
We are ready to die,
Italy called.
Tighten us to cohort,
we are ready to die.
We are ready to die,
Italy called, yes!
We have been centuries for centuries
trampling, mocked,
Why don't we do it,
Because he divided.
Collect us a single
flag, a hope:
to merge together
The time already played.
Let's join, let's love each other,
the union, and love
reveal to peoples
The streets of the Lord;
let's jurist free
Native soil:
United for God
Who can win there?
From the Alps to Sicily
Wherever it is Legnano;
Each of Ferruccio
He has the core, he has his hand,
The children of Italy
It's called Balilla,
The sound of each rings
Vespers played.
They are rushes that bend
The swords sold:
Already the eagle of Austria
The pens has lost.
The blood of Italy,
Polish blood
drink, with the Cossa,
But the heart burned them.

Brothers of Italy
Digoffredo Mameli
Close to the symbols of the state
The tricolor is not simple teacher.
It is a banner of freedom, of a freedom
conquered by a people who recognize themselves united,
who finds his identity in the principles
of brotherhood, of equality, of justice
in the values of one's history and civilization.
