Home » About the League of Arab States » Member States
The League of Arab States was formed in Cairo on 22 March 1945 with six members: Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan (later renamed Jordan), Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Syria, with Yemen joining on 5 May 1945. It currently has 22 member states; Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordon, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Four countries have been admitted as observers: Brazil, Eritrea, India and Venezuela.

Each member state has one vote in the League Council, while decisions are binding only on those states that have voted for them.

The official language of the Arab League and its 22 member states is Arabic.
