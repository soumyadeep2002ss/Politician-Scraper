Quotes from the Director of UNICRI, Antonia Marie De Meo: 

"If you want to be effective, you have to work with communities at the community level, and you have to appeal to values that will resonate with that community.” 

“It’s the work that matters. For the United Nations to fulfil its mandate of promoting international peace and security, staff must respond and take action wherever that mandate takes them. The real work of the United Nations is taking place in the field, close to the people.”
