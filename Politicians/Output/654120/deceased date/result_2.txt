2020 will make history as the year when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world. While humanity has 
borne witness to an almost uninterrupted cycle of wars, health or humanitarian crises, in different parts of 
the  world,  a  health  crisis with  such  a  sudden  and  almost  simultaneous  onset worldwide,  with  similar 
intensity and effects, is an ordeal possibly never seen before. In the first months of the pandemic, confusion 
and fear spread and affected all areas, changed government priorities, and severely restricted activities, 
travel, and even undermined communication for some time. Obviously, the eruption of the pandemic had 
an enormous impact on UNIDROIT. Remote work was established for several months, although the Institute 
never closed. In the heart of a dystopic Rome, with empty streets and silent roads, someone always opened 
the  Institute  in  the  morning  and  closed  it  in  the  evening.  As  a  sign  of  resilience  and to honour  public 
service, UNIDROIT, throughout 2020, did not fail to convene any meeting of its institutional bodies (quite 
the  contrary,  two  Governing  Council  meetings  were  held instead  of  one,  and  three  Finance  Committee 
sessions  took  place  instead  of  two),  all  scheduled  formal  international  meetings were  celebrated, and 
working groups for the different projects met remotely. Notwithstanding the hardship brought about by 
the circumstances, the Institute intensified its work with the use of technology and was able to deliver at 
least as much as any other ordinary year. 
This was also the year when UNIDROIT’s highest Office was revived. On 1 September, Professor Maria 
Chiara Malaguti was appointed President, and the Institute was immediately energized with an injection of 
enthusiasm and a stream of ideas. The Secretariat welcomed her with relief. The future of the Institute, 
approaching its centenary, is looking bright following her able, audacious onward gaze. The arrival of our 
President was the personal upside of a year which had started with extremely sad news for the UNIDROIT 
community:  it  was indeed with  profound  sadness  that,  in  March,  we  learnt  of  the passing  of  Mr  Walter 
Rodinò. A Deputy Secretary-General, Secretary-General ad interim, and Director of the Library, Walter, a 
kind man above all, was the face that welcomed visitors and guests to the Institute for over 40 years. His 
passing  leaves  a  massive  void  in  the  hearts  of the  UNIDROIT  family, in  Rome  and  around  the  world. 
UNIDROIT occupied a large part of his life, and his memory will always be honoured.  
These twelve months have been a period of abundant harvest. After several years of hard work, as 
many  as  three instruments were finalized  and  adopted  by  the  Governing  Council: the  final  draft  of  the 
“Legal Guide on Agricultural Land Investment Contracts”, co-written  with  the  participation  of  IFAD  and 
FAO,  following  a  long  and  thorough public consultation process; the “Tripartite Legal Guide to Uniform 
Legal  Instruments  in  the  Area  of  International  Commercial Contracts (with a focus on sales)”, written 
jointly  with  our  sister  organisations  the  HCCH  and  UNCITRAL; and the “ELI/UNIDROIT  Model  European 
Rules of Civil Procedure”, drafted together with the European Law Institute. These three instruments are 
the  result  of  hard,  collegiate  work  with  other  intergovernmental  and  international  organisations,  and 
constitute an example of institutional synergy and maximization of public resources.  
Intense and productive efforts in the implementation and dissemination of our existing instruments 
were  deployed,  and,  inevitably,  affected  by  the  situation  generated  by  the  pandemic. The  Secretariat 
strived to keep the momentum generated by the Diplomatic Conference that approved the MAC Protocol. 
Although, since March, no missions were allowed and contacts with Governments limited, preparatory work 
to implement the Protocol continued at good pace, and strong support arrived with the signature of the 
MAC Protocol by the United States, whose Secretary of State visited Villa Aldobrandini for the event. The 
economic downturn caused by travel bans across the globe lead to a severe crisis of the aviation sector, 
with many airlines (traditional borrowers under Cape Town Convention schemes) undergoing restructuring 
procedures. This situation implied a real test to the resilience and effectiveness of the Aircraft Protocol and 
the Cape Town system in general. The challenge was faced and the test passed, and, although economic 
turbulence remains in the sector, the endurance of rights protected under the umbrella of the Cape Town 
Protocol has proven to be extraordinary. This is all, indeed, outstanding news for a treaty, which has been 
subject to a stress test like few other international legal instruments ever before. It is now apparent that 
Cape Town adds legal certainty to secured transactions, and this should prove instrumental to assist in the 
post-pandemic  recovery.  The  Cape  Town  system  is  in  excellent  shape, and  we  should  see  substantive 
progress in ratifications in the near future.

Measures  adopted  by  governments  to  contain  the  pandemic  produced  severe  interferences  in 
contractual  performance in international  and  domestic commercial  contracts  around  the  world. The 
situation  caught  many  jurisdictions  with  inadequate  legal  instruments  to  manage  an  ordeal  which 
potentially threatened the stability of their legal framework and court system. It was in this situation where 
the  UNIDROIT  Principles  on  International Commercial  Contracts  arose  as  a useful  solution,  with  special 
regard to its flexible, innovative treatment of force majeure and hardship. The Secretariat published a note 
including a toolkit for the use of the Principles in the pandemic context, which attracted much attention 
and gained the spotlight of academics, legislators and international organisations of lawyers. This has all 
significantly raised awareness on the Principles, as well as proving their usefulness. Here, too, the future 
is looking bright.  
2020 also saw  the kick-off and  rapid  development  of  the  projects  included  in  the  new  Work 
Programme. Following a considerable  amount  of  preparatory  work  and  refinement  of  their  scope,  the 
projects  on  Best  Practices  for  Effective  Enforcement  and  Digital  Assets  and  Private  Law  took  off  with 
extraordinary speed and interest from the international legal community. Technology has facilitated remote 
meetings, and projects have gained considerable velocity and efficiency thanks to the frequent convening 
of  subgroups  within  each  working  group.  This  new  methodology  is  no  doubt  here  to  stay,  and  has  the 
potential of substantially reducing the cost and the time in the drafting of instruments. Excellent progress 
has  also  been  made  in  the  project  to  draft  a  Model  Law  on  Factoring,  and  a  new  project,  to  be  jointly 
conducted  with  UNCITRAL,  to  draft  a  Model  Law  on  Warehouse Receipts was  admitted  into  the  Work 
Programme  by  the  General  Assembly  following  a  recommendation  by  the  Governing  Council  in  its  99
th
 
session. As will be apparent to the reader, consistency and complementarity of all ongoing projects is a 
feature of the current Programme.  
From a purely institutional standpoint, budgetary balance was observed and savings attained. The 
Institute  used  the  funds  saved  in  travel  and  missions  to  invest  in  infrastructure  and,  especially,  in 
technology, setting the basis for a work model that is likely to be part of our practice in the years to come. 
Hard  times  can  be  faced  defensively,  trying  to preserve  what  one  has,  hoping  for  the  storm  to  pass. 
Alternatively, they can be seen as an opportunity to transform hardship into virtue and work harder than 
ever, unfurling  all  sails so  the  storm  wind  takes  you  farther,  quicker allowing  you  to  reach  far  beyond 
where one had even dared to dream of. 2020 brought us a massive storm; and I am prouder than ever to 
say that UNIDROIT rose to the challenge.

1. Presidency 
In  accordance  with  Article  6(2)  of  the UNIDROIT Statute,  the  Italian 
Government  appointed  Professor  Maria  Chiara  Malaguti  as  President  of 
UNIDROIT for a five-year term commencing on 1 September 2020. Professor 
Malaguti holds a Chair of International Law in the Faculty of Economics of 
the  Catholic  University  of  Milan,  and is a  well-known,  highly  regarded 
academic, with wide expertise in the fields of unification and harmonisation 
of   international private law, and   with   substantial   experience   in 
intergovernmental organisations and international financial institutions. 
 
2.  Governing Council 
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Secretariat proposed that the 99
th 
session of the Governing 
Council
2
 be separated into two meetings. Mr Arthur Hartkamp was appointed First Vice President, 
and Mr Alexander Komarov Second Vice President in accordance with the special Rules of Procedure 
for both meetings that were established beforehand by consensus of the Council. 
A first meeting was held in April/May via remote written procedure, and addressed the most urgent 
matters concerning the 2020-2022 Work Programme, including a recommendation to include the 
drafting, jointly with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), of a 
Model Law on Warehouse Receipts as a new project with high priority status, and to upgrade the 
level  of  priority  of  two  projects  (Best  Practices  for  Effective  Enforcement  and  Digital  Assets  and 
Private Law). For additional information on the 99
th
 session (A), see the Governing Council Report).  
Professor Maria Chiara Malaguti, the then newly appointed President of UNIDROIT, chaired the second 
meeting held in hybrid format from 23 to 25 September 2020. 
The Governing Council praised the work done by the Secretariat notwithstanding the difficult context 
created  by  the  pandemic, and showed  satisfaction  at the UNIDROIT Foundation  for  its  improved 
performance. When  discussing  the  draft Budget for 2021,  the  Council  commended  the  positive 
impact of cost-saving measures and management efficiencies.  
The Council was also presented with a progress report on the work undertaken by the Secretariat 
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: the preparation of a series of guidance documents regarding 
how COVID-19 affects a number of leading UNIDROIT instruments and how they can help overcome 
the  challenges  deriving  from  the  pandemic  and  its  economic  consequences,  as  well  as  related 
outreach initiatives.  
The Governing Council adopted three instruments during its 99
th
 session:

Committee  was  originally  called  as  a  physical  meeting,  to  be  held  at  the  seat  of UNIDROIT on  19 
March 2020. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, led the Secretary-General to adopt a 
remote written procedure to ensure the timely approval of the administrative documents. The 89
th
 
session was an extraordinary session called by the Chair on 25 June 2020 to discuss the impact of 
the  outbreak  of  the  COVID-19  on UNIDROIT’s  activities  and  on  its  finances,  and  to  allow  the

The Secretariat continues consultations with several non-Member States with a view to their possible 
accession  to  the UNIDROIT Statute. Due  to  the  limitations  imposed by the  COVID  19  pandemic, 
mission travel and visits to UNIDROIT’s Seat by Government Officials were considerably fewer than 
in an ordinary year. Bilateral and multilateral exchanges with Government officials, plentiful both 
with Member and with non-Member States, took place through videoconference. Exceptionally, the 
following in-person meetings took place:

On 8 January 2020, the Ambassador of the State of Qatar in Italy, His Excellency Mr Abdulaziz Bin 
Ahmed  Al  Malki  Al  Jehani,  visited UNIDROIT to  deposit  Qatar’s  instrument  of  accession  to  the 
Convention  on  International  Interests  in  Mobile  Equipment  (Cape  Town  Convention)  and  to  its 
Protocol on Matters specific to Aircraft Equipment (Aircraft Protocol).  
From  the 22

Bank   for   Reconstruction   and   Development   (EBRD) 
focussing on the cost of possible missed opportunities to 
implement reform in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis. As 
the  COVID-19  pandemic  continues  to  trigger  serious 
economic  impacts  in  both  the  developed  and  emerging 
markets,  the  expert  panel  was  invited  to  discuss  the 
implications of the pandemic in terms of demographic and 
economic  changes,  the  effects  of  a  potential  wave  of  insolvency,  and  the  effects  on  the  most 
vulnerable  economic  players,  to  provide  arguments  as  to  why  legislators  should  seize  the 
opportunity  to  introduce  reforms.  Secretary-General  Tirado  highlighted  how,  given  the  enhanced 
political will, this situation can be turned into an opportunity to undertake a thorough modernisation 
of  existing  legal  frameworks,  which  is  to  be  undertaken  alongside  investments  both  in  capacity 
building and in improvement of the legal infrastructure, specially through IT upgrades.

On 13 February 2020, the Pretoria MAC Protocol was presented in the context of the workshop on 
the Implementation of Secured Transactions Reforms in Latin America organised by UNCITRAL and 
UNIDROIT and co-sponsored with Confcámaras of Colombia in Cartagena, Colombia, hosted by the 
Universidad de los Andes (see above page 14), in a panel with participation of Deputy-Secretary 
General  Anna  Veneziano,  Jae  Sung  Lee  (UNCITRAL),  John  Wilson  (WBG),  and  Néstor  Santiago 
Arévalo Barrero (Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism). 
On  14  February  2020, UNIDROIT and  UNCITRAL  co-sponsored  with  Confcámaras of  Colombia  a 
workshop on the Implementation of Secured Transactions Reforms in Latin America in Cartagena, 
Colombia,  hosted  by  the  Universidad  de  los  Andes  and  with  participation  as  panellists  of  several 
experts  from  academia,  private  practice,  government  and  international  organisations.  This 
conference featured a presentation on the MAC Protocol. 
On 30 April 2020, the MAC Protocol was discussed as part of an online forum entitled “Toward 
Coordinated Implementation of International Standards for Secured Transactions” co-organised by 
the NatLaw and the World Bank Group.  
In the context of the webinar organised by the OAS on 13 July 2020, discussing improvement of 
access to credit in a post-COVID economy, the Deputy Secretary-General addressed, among other 
issues, the potential benefits of the MAC Protocol to the Cape Town Convention on access to credit. 
For more information on this event see above page 13. 
On 3 December 2020, UNIDROIT participated  in a 
virtual  forum  organised  by  the  NatLaw  Center 
which    examined    the    importance    of,    and 
opportunities created by the MAC Protocol in Latin 
America.   The   Forum   featured   presentations 
focusing on the potential of the MAC Protocol for 
Latin American States by Professor Ignacio Tirado 
(Secretary-General  of UNIDROIT),  Rafael  Castillo-
Tiriana (CEO Latín América and Emerging Markets 
at The Alta Group), Teresa Rodríguez de las Heras Ballell (Associate Professor in Commercial Law at 
Universidad Carlos III de Madrid), and Carlos Sierra (Partner at Sierra Abogados). 
On 17 December 2020, UNIDROIT, in partnership with the U.S. Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome 
organised a panel discussion on ‘The Global Reach of the Cape Town Convention: The Potential for 
the Mining, Agriculture, and Construction (MAC) Sectors’. This panel was an official side-event to 
the 79
th
 session of the UNIDROIT General Assembly taking place earlier that day. The event brought 
together over 90 legal  experts, government representatives and industry stakeholders to discuss 
the  potential  of  the  Cape  Town  Convention  and  its  MAC  Protocol  for  the  Mining, Agriculture,  and 
Construction sectors in developing and developed countries alike. Opening remarks were delivered 
by Professor Ignacio Tirado, Secretary-General of UNIDROIT, followed by a panel discussion chaired 
by Professor Anna Veneziano, Deputy Secretary-General of UNIDROIT. The Panel featured remarks 
from Advocate Sandea De Wet (Chief State Law Advisor of the Department of International Relations 
and Cooperation of South Africa, and President of the Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of the 
MAC   Protocol),   Mr   Daryl   Bouwkamp   (Senior   Director 
International Business Development and Government Affairs 
at  Vermeer  Corporation,  and  member  of the  MAC  Working 
Group), and Professor Henry Gabriel (Professor of Law, Elon 
University and Member of the Governing Council of UNIDROIT). 
The panel was followed by a short Q&A session, after which 
closing remarks were delivered by Ambassador Kip Tom, U.S. 
Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies in Rome.

2. Private Law and Agricultural Development 
a.  Legal Guide on Agricultural Land Investment Contracts  
• Approval of the ALIC Guide 
In September 2020, the UNIDROIT Governing Council approved the Final Draft of the ALIC Guide, 
subject  to  possible  minor  adjustments  during  the  process  leading  to  the  approval  by  the  partner 
Organisations (FAO and IFAD). 
The ALIC Guide contains seven chapters and is to be used by legal counsels involved in the leasing 
of  agricultural  land  (e.g.  investment  contracts,  concessions,  leases)  in  order  to  support  the 
preparation, negotiation  and  implementation  of  agricultural  land  investment  contracts  that  are 
consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Voluntary Guidelines 
on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the context of National 
Food Security (VGGT), the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems 
(CFS-RAI Principles) and other international instruments.  
The  Legal  Guide,  which  is  to  build  upon  the  success  of  the UNIDROIT/FAO/IFAD  Legal  Guide  on 
Contract Farming and the UPICC – will not promote large-scale land acquisition but will acknowledge 
that leases of agricultural land continue to occur and that they present many challenges. In doing 
so, the ALIC Guide will seek to respond to the need for greater and more responsible agricultural 
investment by raising awareness about alternative investment models and by helping to ensure that 
stakeholders’ rights, including those of legitimate tenure right holders, are both protected and 
respected. 
• Working Group  
A UNIDROIT Working  Group  for  the  preparation  of  a  Legal  Guide  on  Agricultural  Land  Investment 
Contracts was set up in 2016. The Working Group, chaired by Mr José Antonio Moreno Rodríguez, 
Member of  the UNIDROIT Governing  Council,  was  composed  of  contract  law  and  international 
investment  law  experts,  representatives  of  FAO and  IFAD as  partner  organisations,  and  included 
observers from other multilateral organisations as well as representatives of agricultural producers 
and agribusiness. The Working Group held in total two informal meetings in 2016 and 2017, and 
four formal meetings in 2017 and 2018. 
• Consultations 
To inform the preparation of the final draft, consultation meetings took place in Beijing, São Paulo, 
Nairobi followed by consultations on Internet (see Annual Report 2019, pp. 21-22). The reports of 
the   consultations   held   throughout   the   year   of   2019   containing   all   the   comments   and 
recommendations received from the online consultation and the regional consultation events were 
submitted to the Working Group members in February 2020.  
• Drafting Committee meeting 
The UNIDROIT Secretariat  organised,  in  coordination  with  FAO  and  IFAD,  a  drafting  committee 
meeting on 2 – 3 March 2020. During this meeting, the Secretariat provided a brief overview of the 
outcome of the consultations and an update on the next steps for finalisation of the ALIC Guide. 
Members of the drafting committee, including experts from the ALIC Working Group, reviewed each 
comment and recommendation received on a chapter-by-chapter basis and decided how the various 
chapters of the ALIC Zero Draft should be accordingly adapted. A number of issues were discussed, 
such  as:  (a)  terminology;  (b)  the  framing  of  guidance;  (c)  the  appropriate  level  of  detail;  (d) 
references to other instruments and sources; and (e) revisions of an editorial nature as to clarity of 
expression and user-friendliness. The Secretariat subsequently revised the ALIC Zero Draft in order 
to account for the decisions taken by the drafting committee on the basis of the feedback received 
throughout the consultation process.

b. Legal structure of agricultural enterprises 
In the context of UNIDROIT’s ongoing collaboration with FAO and IFAD, the project regarding “Legal 
structure of agricultural enterprises” was selected by the Governing Council at its 98
th
 session to be 
developed  during  the  2020-2022  Work  Programme.  In  2020,  the  Secretariat  conducted  a 
stocktaking  exercise  and  feasibility  analysis  with  respect  to  the  legal  structure  for  investment  in 
agriculture activities, in order to ascertain whether UNIDROIT could make a useful contribution in this 
field. The feasibility study highlighted that the project could, tentatively, work on the contractual 
and corporate aspects of the different business models envisaged in FAO’s and IFAD’s guidance 
documents,  addressing  questions  to  improve  access  to  market,  increase  the  size  of  agricultural 
enterprises,  ease  access  to  critical  resources  and  insurance,  as  well  as  cover  unfair  commercial 
practices. 
At  its  99
th 
session,  the  Governing  Council  took  note  of  the  feasibility  study  and  authorised  the 
Secretariat  to  conduct  further  research  and  preliminary  consultations  with  a  view  to  convene  a 
colloquium in 2021 and subsequently establish a core expert group to define the potential scope, 
content, and form of such an instrument.  
3. Transnational Civil Procedure 
a. ELI-UNIDROIT Model European Rules on Civil Procedure 
• Approval of the ELI-UNIDROIT Model European Rules on Civil Procedure 
The  “ELI-UNIDROIT Model  European  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure” 
were approved in the second half of 2020 by both organisations 
as   the   finalised   outcome   of   the   project,   which   saw   the 
involvement   of   over   fifty   experts   from   different   European 
jurisdictions, observer organisations and additional advisers. The 
finalised    instrument    is    composed    of    Model    Rules    and 
accompanying Comments  and  is  preceded  by  a  Preamble  on  the  history  and  development  of  the 
project as well as its purpose, methodology and underlying principles. The Model Rules, which are 
divided into twelve Chapters covering the whole spectrum of civil procedure, aim at offering detailed 
guidance for further development of legal systems in this sector in Europe and beyond. 
As regards the developments during 2020, in accordance with ELI’s practice the draft of the black-
letter Rules and Comments in English prepared in the course of 2019 by a Final Drafting Team was 
submitted in January 2020 to the scrutiny of two ELI Assessors in order to obtain their comments. 
UNIDROIT and  ELI simultaneously  circulated  the  draft  to  the  ELI  Senate,  Advisory  Committee, 
Membership Consultative Committee, as well as to the Members of the UNIDROIT Governing Council. 
The revised version of the black-letter Rules and Comments in English resulting from the round of 
comments was submitted to the ELI Executive Council on 3 June 2020 for approval, accompanied 
by the French version of the black-letter Rules, as well as a separate document containing articulated 
replies to the issues raised by the ELI Assessors and other commentators. 
The draft was approved by the ELI Council on 15 July 2020 and following ELI’s rules of procedure 
also by the ELI Membership through electronic vote on 5 August 2020.  
Finally, the ELI-UNIDROIT Model European Rules of European Civil Procedure were submitted to the 
UNIDROIT Governing Council, at its second meeting of its 99
th
 session on 23 – 25 September 2020, 
when they were formally approved and authorised for publication.   
• Linguistic versions and publication 
The UNIDROIT Secretariat provided the translation of the comments of the French version of the ELI-
UNIDROIT Model Rules. As to other linguistic versions, ELI and UNIDROIT agreed on a procedure for 
the joint approval of translations of the Model Rules. 

Legislative activities 
 23 
ELI and UNIDROIT also signed a Memorandum  of  Understanding  concerning  the  publication  of  the 
Rules, whereby the ELI undertook to provide for open-access publication by Oxford University Press 
in 2021. 
• Presentations, seminars and conferences  
The ELI-UNIDROIT Rules were featured in a number of conferences, lectures and other dissemination 
events. Those with the participation of UNIDROIT representatives included: 
On  30  March  2020,  the  ELI-UNIDROIT project  on  European  Rules  of 
Civil  Procedure  was  presented  in  a  lecture  at  the  IE  Law  School 
(Madrid), featured as part of the Jean Monnet Chair in European Civil 
Procedure,  under  the  direction  of  Professor  Marco  de  Benito.  The 
lecture   was   conducted   by the Deputy   Secretary-General   and 
Fernando  Gascòn  Inchausti  (Professor  at  Universidad  Complutense, 
Madrid and Co-Reporter within the ELI-UNIDROIT Project), with active 
remote participation of enrolled students from various jurisdictions. 
On 10 September 2020, the ELI-UNIDROIT Rules were presented at 
a  webinar  organised  by  ELI  in  the  context  of  its  virtual  9
th
 Annual  Conference.  The  Programme 
included an introduction by Co-Chairs Diana Wallis and Deputy Secretary-General Anna Veneziano, 
and  presentations  by  Paul  Oberhammer,  Rolf  Stürner  and  John  Sorabji,  followed  by  external 
discussant Marco De Benito.  
The  Rules  were also presented on  25  September  2020, in  an 
International Workshop webinar that was held in hybrid format as a 
closing event of the 99
th
 session of the UNIDROIT Governing Council. 
The event was opened by President Maria Chiara Malaguti, Secretary-
General Ignacio Tirado and ELI President Christiane Wendehorst, and 
featured three panels, respectively on: the History of the Project and 
an   Introduction   to   the   Rules, Party   Disposition   and   Case 
Management, and  the  Rules  as  a  Model  for  Supranational  and 
National Legislators.  
b. Best Practices for Effective Enforcement 
• Development of the project 
The project on Best Practices for Effective Enforcement (BPEE) was included in the 2020-2022 Work 
Programme by the General Assembly (A.G. (78) 12, paras. 41 and 51, and A.G. (78) 3), confirming 
the recommendation of the Governing Council (C.D. (98) 17, para. 245), upon a proposal of the 
World Bank, and as a continuation, and a refinement, of the scope of the “Principles of Effective 
Enforcement” project. While there was substantial agreement on the importance of the topic and on 
the legal, social and economic impact of the work to be conducted, the Secretariat was asked to 
produce a more refined scope of the project to be presented at the 99
th
 session of the Governing 
Council in 2020. 
During the first part of that session, held  remotely in April/May 2020, Council Members commented 
on the revised Secretariat’s paper (C.D. (99) A.3), and authorised the setting up of an Exploratory 
Working Group to receive expert feedback on the questions raised (C.D. (99) A.8, paras. 43-44).  
In  response  to  this  mandate,  the UNIDROIT Secretariat  developed  a  Consultation  Document 
containing a set of questions based on the comments received during the session. The document 
was  designed  to  better  define  the  most  appropriate  guidance  for  the  future  Working  Group  in 
determining the type of envisaged instrument and the scope of the project, and formed the basis 
for a first round of remote consultations with selected international experts and organisations. The 
Secretariat  received  answers  and  feedback  from  several  individual  experts  in  comparative  civil 
procedure, secured transactions, insolvency, contract law, and technology as applied to law, and 
from a number of intergovernmental and international organisations. 

UNIDROIT – Annual Report – 2020 
24 
In  addition,  on  21  September  2020  the  Secretariat  organised  an 
Internal Consultation Workshop with participation of invited experts, 
relevant organisations and members of the Governing Council, which 
focused on issues of scope of the future instrument and the impact 
and relevance of technological developments for enforcement. The 
Workshop was opened by Secretary-General Ignacio Tirado and Nina 
Pavlova   Mocheva   (Senior   Financial   Sector   Specialist,   Finance, 
Competitiveness & Innovation Global Practice, World Bank Group), and featured one panel on issues 
of scope, chaired by Governing Council Member Kathryn Sabo, as well as a panel on the impact of 
new technologies on enforcement.  
At the September meeting of its 99
th
 session (23 – 25 September 
2020), the Governing Council discussed the revised Secretariat’s 
document  including  the  outcome  of  the  consultations  (C.D.  (99) 
B.3), approved the guidelines provided by the Secretariat regarding 
the proposed scope of the project, confirmed the high priority status 
assigned  to  the  project,  and  authorised  the  establishment  of  a 
Working Group. 
• Working Group 
The  first  meeting  of  the  Working  Group  on  BPEE was  held  in  Rome  and  on  Zoom between 30 
November and 2 December  2020, and  was  chaired  by Governing  Council  Member Kathryn Sabo. 
The Working Group focused, for the most part, on the more precise determination of scope of the 
project,  as  well  as  on  methodology  and  organisational  issues,  and  discussed  the  impact  of 
technology in enforcement. 
For more information, see the documents (Study LXXVIB – W.G.1 – Doc. 1 rev.; Study LXXVIB – 
W.G.1 – Doc. 2) and the Report of the first Working Group session. 
• Presentations, seminars and conferences 
On 12 November 2020, UNIDROIT’s work in the field of transnational civil procedure, including the 
project  on  BPEE,  was  presented  in  the  context  of  the  conference  co-sponsored  by UNIDROIT,  the 
HCCH, and UNCITRAL, on “International Commercial Litigation: Recent Developments and Future 
Challenges”, organised by the Judicial Policy Research Institute (JPRI) and held in Seoul, Korea (see 
above page 11). In particular, Deputy Secretary-General Professor Anna Veneziano participated in 
a panel moderated by Professor Hwang Hyun Suk, on “Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign 
Judgments”, together with Justice David Goddard (New Zealand Court of Appeal) and Presiding 
Judge  Jiyong  Jang.  The  panel  was  followed  by  a  discussion  with  the  additional  participation  of 
Professor Gyooho Lee and Judge Yoon Jong Kim.  
4. Model Law on Warehouse Receipts  
• Development of the project 
The proposal of developing a joint instrument had originated from an invitation from UNCITRAL’s 
Secretariat  to  consider  joint  work  on  warehouse  receipts,  pursuant  to  a  resolution  from  its  52
nd
 
Commission  Session  in  July  2019.  UNCITRAL’s  invitation  could  be  contextualised  in  the  long-
standing  relationship  between  both  institutions,  their  expertise  on  topics  relevant  to  warehouse 
receipts, and the project’s adequate fit within their current work programmes.  
Warehouse  receipts  are  titles  to  commodities  stored  in  a  warehouse.  The  holder  of  the  title  can 
exercise  ownership  over  the  commodities, and is therefore  able  to  access  financing  by  either 
transferring the commodities without the commodities moving out of the warehouse, or by way of 
establishing  a  security  right  over  the  title.  This  is  a  very  important  instrument  from  a  practical 
standpoint, as it drastically enhances the possibility, especially of small businesses in the agricultural 
sector, to access finance.  

Legislative activities 
 25 
It is envisaged that the Model Law shall consist of a set of black letter rules covering the private law 
aspects of a warehouse receipt system. Importantly, the Model Law will contemplate the issuance 
and  transfer  of  electronic  warehouse  receipts,  including  through  the  use  of  electronic  platforms, 
distributed ledger technology systems, and other technological mechanisms. It is anticipated that it 
will be a standalone instrument for adoption by States seeking to reform their national legislation. 
As all UNCITRAL and UNIDROIT instruments, the Model Law shall be compatible with both common 
law and civil law jurisdictions. 
At  the first  meeting  of  the 99
th
 session  of  the  Governing  Council  held  in  April/May  2020,  the 
Secretariat introduced the proposal to include the joint project to draft a Model Law on Warehouse 
Receipts as a new item  in the 2020-2022 Work Programme. The Governing Council unanimously 
approved the project with high priority status for the 2020-2022 Triennial Work Programme (C.D. 
(99)  A.8), followed by UNCITRAL’s Commission at its 53
rd
 session  in  September  2020  (UN  Doc. 
A/75/17), and the UNIDROIT General Assembly at its 79
th
 session in December 2020 (A.G. (79) 10). 
• Working Group 
Following approval of the project, a Working Group was established. It is composed of ten expert 
members  from  different  legal  systems  and  geographical  regions,  as  well  as  six  international 
organisations  and  eleven  public  and  private  sector  stakeholders  participating  in  the  project  as 
observers.
4
 It is chaired by Professor Eugenia Dacoronia, Member of the UNIDROIT Governing Council. 
The Working Group held its first session on 2 – 4 December 2020 in a hybrid format. The Group’s 
discussions were  guided  by  an Issues  Paper  which  had  been  prepared  by  the  Secretariat,  in 
collaboration with several Working Group members, where the key elements that should be covered 
by the Model Law were analysed. These elements included the following: definitions; legal status 
and format of warehouse receipts; receipt details and form; transfer of warehouse receipts and their 
registration;  execution  and  priority  of  security  rights  and  liens;  and  rights  and  obligations  of  the 
warehouse  operator.  Furthermore,  the  Issues  Paper  provided  a  brief  overview  of  the  relevant 
international instruments that the Working Group should take into consideration for the preparation 
of the Model Law. 
Following  that  first  session,  the  Secretariat  set  up  a  Drafting  Committee  which  prepared  two 
suggested draft chapters for the future Model Law, namely Chapter II “Issue of a warehouse receipt”, 
which also included draft provisions on the form and content requirements for a warehouse receipt, 
and  Chapter  IV  “Transfer  of  warehouse  receipts.  Protected  holders  and  other  transferees. 
Warranties. Miscellaneous provisions regarding transfer”. In addition, an informal subgroup on 
selected technological aspects was created, which collected information on the transfer of electronic 
warehouse receipts and, more broadly, on possible legislative approaches to addressing both paper 
and  electronic  receipts  in  the  Model  Law  provisions.  The  two  suggested  draft  chapters  and  the 
technology-specific information were to be presented to the Working Group at its second session 
held on 10 – 12 March 2021.  
• Presentations, seminars and conferences  
On   26   March   2020, UNIDROIT and   UNCITRAL   co-organised 
a Webinar on a Model Law on Warehouse Receipt Project to discuss 
the proposal of legislative joint work on warehouse receipts, with 
particular  focus  on  the  possible  drafting  of  a  Model  Law.  The 
Webinar gathered input from a multidisciplinary group of experts 
from    various    geographic    regions    representing    academia, 
stakeholders,  institutional  actors,  and  international  organisations 
active in the field. The conclusions and recommendations of the Webinar confirmed the desirability 
and potential benefits of a Model Law that would be endorsed at the international level.

5. UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts  
a. Formulation of Principles of Reinsurance Contracts  
• Development of the project 
The  continuation  of  the  project  on  Principles  of  Reinsurance  Contract  (PRICL),  which  links 
reinsurance contracts with the UPICC, was approved by the UNIDROIT General Assembly in 2019 as 
part  of  the  Work  Programme  2020-2022,  upon  the  recommendation  of  the  Governing  Council  to 
accept the proposal by the PRICL Working Group for an extension of the subject matter covered by 
the project. The second part of the project will comprise the following topics: “Back-to-back-cover”; 
“Non-contractual liability clauses”, “Termination and recapture”, and “Limitation periods”. UNIDROIT’s 
continued participation was envisaged because of the strong connection between these topics and 
the UPICC.  
Though 2020, full meetings of the PRICL Working Group were adjourned because of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the Working Group members continued their activity, including the publication of private 
translations of the 2019 PRICL into Japanese, Polish, Spanish and Turkish. These translations can 
be found at https://www.ius.uzh.ch/de/research/projects/pricl/Private-Translations.html. 
• Presentations, seminars and conferences  
On  17  September  2020,  AIDA  Europe,  in  cooperation  with  the 
PRICL Project Group, the AIDA Reinsurance Working Party, and 
the AIDA Dispute Resolution Working Party set up a PRICL Mock 
Arbitration  to  examine  the  application  of  the  PRICL  in  a  live 
environment with arguments presented by the parties in front of 
a single arbitrator and with a legal opinion for the case, rendered 
by  an  Advocate  General. The  documentation,  as  well  as  access  to  the 
recording,  can  be  found at https://aidainsurance.org/meetings/pricl-mock-
arbitration_2020-09-17. 
On  9  October  2020,  Secretary-General  Ignacio  Tirado  provided  a  closing 
speech at the “II International Congress of Insurance Law”, which was co-
hosted  by  ICADE  Business  School,  the  Faculty  of  Economics  and  Business 
Administration at Comillas Pontifical University and the Uria-Menendez Law 
firm (Madrid,  Spain).  Professor  Tirado  contributed  with  a  presentation  on 
Restatement  over  Reinsurance  Contracts,  where  he  illustrated  the PRICL 
project.  
• Publications 
The presentations of the panel that was held on 10 May 2019 as a closing event to the 98
th
 session 
of  the UNIDROIT Governing  Council  were  published  in  March  2020  in  the  Uniform  Law  Review,

b. UNILEX database 
The UNILEX database, with Michael Joachim Bonell, Emeritus Professor, University of Rome I, as 
Editor-in-Chief, is accessible free of charge directly at www.UNILEX.info as well as on the UNIDROIT 
website. It has two sections, one on the UPICC (Co-Editor-in-Chief: Eleonora Finazzi-Agrò) and the 
other  on  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  Contracts  for  the  International  Sale  of  Goods  (CISG) 
(Co-Editor-in-Chief: Roberta Peleggi). They   include   analysed and   classified   case   law   and 
bibliographies, as well as the texts of the instruments. The collected decisions are  accessible not 
only by date, court or arbitral tribunal, and article(s) of the instrument expressly referred to, but 
also by “issues” listed under each article in a systematic order, thereby making it possible to find 
out immediately if and, if so, how, a particular question concerning the application of the provision 
has already been decided by a court or arbitral tribunal. In the section on the UNIDROIT Principles 
the  decisions  are  further  classified  according  to,  respectively,  the  type  of  contract  to  which  they 

Legislative activities 
 27 
relate, the nationality of the parties involved, as well as those cases where the UNIDROIT Principles 
were used to interpret a particular domestic law or international law. 
Both  sections  are  updated  regularly  and, as  of  31  December  2020,  the  section  on  the UNIDROIT 
Principles contained a total of 524 cases (315 decided by domestic courts of 35 countries plus the 
Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Communities,  the  Economic  Court  of  the  Commonwealth  of 
Independent States (CIS), the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), 
the  Iranian-U.S.  Arbitral  Tribunal  and  the  United  Nations  Compensation  Commission,  and  209 
arbitral awards rendered by international arbitral tribunals); the section on the CISG contained a 
total of 956 cases decided by domestic courts of 40 countries and of 88 arbitral awards. 
6. International Sales Law - “Tripartite” UNCITRAL-HCCH-UNIDROIT Legal Guide  
• Approval of the “Tripartite” UNCITRAL-HCCH-UNIDROIT Legal Guide  
2020  saw  the  finalisation  and  subsequent  approval  by  all  three  sponsoring  organisations  of  the 
“Tripartite”  UNCITRAL-HCCH-UNIDROIT  Legal  Guide  to  Uniform  Instruments  in  the  Area  of 
International Commercial Contracts (with a focus on sales). The Guide was the outcome of a project 
initiated by UNCITRAL and supported by the Secretariats of the three “sister” organisations, with 
participation of an International Expert Group composed of Professors Neil B. Cohen, Lauro Gama 
Jr., Hiroo Sono, Pilar Perales Viscasillas, and Stefan Vogenauer. 
Following up on a round of consultations on a first completed draft of the Guide conducted at the 
end of 2019, the draft Tripartite Guide was re-submitted to the HCCH membership for discussion at 
the Council on General Affairs and Policy (CGAP) on 3 – 6 March 2020. The CGAP approved the first 
three  Chapters  of  the  Guide  and  invited  the  Permanent  Bureau  to  continue  its  cooperation  with 
UNCITRAL    and UNIDROIT towards    its finalisation, publication    and    promotion    (see 
https://assets.hcch.net/docs/70458042-f771-4e94-9c56-df3257a1e5ff.pdf). 
At  the  same  time,  the UNIDROIT Secretariat  shared  the  draft  with  the Members of  its Governing 
Council and received comments from some of them as well as from the Organization of American 
States, which were incorporated in the Draft. 
The Tripartite Legal Guide was unanimously approved at the first meeting of the 99
th
 session of the 
UNIDROIT Governing  Council,  subject  to  such  minor  amendments  as  might  be  introduced  by  the 
discussion which would take place at the UNCITRAL session in 2020 (see UNIDROIT C.D. (99) A.8, 
para. 38).  
At  its  53
rd
 session  held  virtually  in  July  2020,  the  UNCITRAL  Commission  discussed  the  draft 
Tripartite   Guide   together   with the   proposed adjustments,   as   detailed   in their document 
A/CN.9/1030, and  deriving  from:  (a)  consideration  of  comments  received  by  the  UNCITRAL 
Secretariat in advance of the session (particularly by the CISG Advisory Council); (b) insertion of a 
reference to the HCCH Convention of 2 July 2019 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign 
Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters; (c) insertion of a reference to the ICC Force Majeure and 
Hardship clauses 2020; (d) insertion of the contribution of OHADA on the OHADA Uniform Act on 
General Commercial Law; (e) formal corrections. All proposed adjustments were agreed upon by 
the  three  Secretariats.  In  recognising  the  usefulness  of  such  a  guidance  instrument  and  the 
importance  of  the  cooperation  and  coordination  among  HCCH,  UNCITRAL  and UNIDROIT,  the 
UNCITRAL  Commission  authorised  the  Secretariat  to  publish  the  Guide  with  the  proposed 
adjustments, recommending the addition of an executive summary.  
The  revised  Tripartite  Guide  was  presented  at  the  second  meeting  of  the  99
th
 session  of  the 
Governing Council (B) that took note of the approval by UNCITRAL and authorised the publication 
of the Guide.  
As a follow up to the approval of the Guide, UNCITRAL undertook to produce a consolidated text in 
English and translations in all other UN official languages.

• Presentations, seminars and conferences  
On 22 September 2020, on the eve of the second meeting of the 99
th
 Governing Council session, 
the UNIDROIT Secretariat hosted a hybrid international conference 
illustrating the contribution of HCCH, UNCITRAL and UNIDROIT to 
the  harmonisation  of  the  law  of  international  sales  and  the 
Tripartite  Legal  Guide  to  Uniform  Instruments  in  the  Area  of 
International Commercial Contracts (with a focus on sales).  
The  event  featured  opening  addresses  from  the  President  and 
Secretary-General of UNIDROIT, the Secretary-General of the HCCH and the Secretary of UNCITRAL, 
and  was  followed  by  three  panels,  respectively  chaired  by  HCCH Senior Legal Officer Ning  Zhao, 
Governing  Council Member Professor  Henry  Gabriel  and UNIDROIT Secretary-General  Professor 
Ignacio  Tirado,  with  participation  of  the  experts  who  contributed  to  the  drafting  of  the  Guide 
(Professors Neil B. Cohen, Lauro Gama Jr., Hiroo Sono, Pilar Perales Viscasillas, Stefan Vogenauer), 
as well as additional  experts (Professor Michael Joachim Bonell, UNCITRAL Principal Legal Officer 
José Angelo Estrella Faria, and Governing Council Members Professors Bénédicte Fauvarque-Cosson 
and Jinxia Shi). The event was concluded by a discussion with UNIDROIT Governing Council Members 
and about 60 attendees participated live with a very interesting Q&A session.  
The video of the conference is available in the UNIDROIT YouTube channel: Playlist 
7. Digital Assets and Private Law  
• Development of the project 
The  General  Assembly,  at  its  78
th
 session,  approved  the  inclusion  of  the  project  in  the  Work 
Programme of the Institute for the 2020-2022 triennium as recommended by the Governing Council 
(A.G. (78) 12, paras. 43 and 51, and A.G. (78) 3 paras. 69-71). The General Assembly asked the 
Secretariat to further determine the scope of the project and present it for reconsideration at the 
next  session  of  the  Governing  Council.  To  carry  out  the  mandate  received  from  the  General 
Assembly,  a  second  joint UNIDROIT and  UNCITRAL  workshop  was  convened  at  the  UNCITRAL 
Secretariat in Vienna on 10 – 11 March 2020 with the aim of developing “a legal taxonomy of key 
emerging technologies and their applications”. 
On the basis of the discussions during the first and second workshops (Rome, 6-7 May 2019, and 
Vienna, 10 – 11 March 2020, respectively) a document was submitted to the Governing Council at 
its first meeting of the 99
th
 session  (C.D. (99) A.4, paras. 23-33) which set out the Secretariat’s 
proposal  on a more  refined  and  limited scope  for  this  project.  The  Governing  Council  agreed  to 
approve  the  scope and to upgrade  the project  to  high priority,  as  well  as  to  follow  the amended 
proposed action by the Secretariat (C.D. (99) A.8, paras. 57-58).  
• Exploratory Working Group 
Carrying out the mandate received from the Governing Council, the 
Secretariat set up an Exploratory Working Group, chaired by Professor 
Hideki Kanda, Member of the UNIDROIT Governing Council, which held 
five  meetings  between  July  and September  2020  and  prepared  a 
preliminary draft Issues Paper. Additionally, the Exploratory Working 
Group  facilitated  the  organisation  of  an  Exploratory  Workshop  on 
Digital  Assets  and  Private  Law  which  was  held  on  17  and  18 
September 2020 in a hybrid manner.  
The Secretariat presented the result of the deliberations of the Exploratory Working Group and the 
outcomes of the Exploratory Workshop at the second meeting of the 99
th
 UNIDROIT Governing Council 
(C.D. (99) B.4 rev.). The UNIDROIT Governing Council confirmed approval the “Digital Assets and 
Private Law” project at a high priority, allowing the Secretariat to establish a Working Group (C.D. 
(99) B Misc. 2, paras. 7 and 8).

• Working Group 
Under the guidance of its Chair Professor Hideki Kanda, the Working 
Group  held  its  first  session on 17 – 19  November  2020.  A  further 
three sessions of the Working Group were planned for 2021. As part 
of  intersessional  work  conducted  between  the  Working  Group’s 
sessions,  four  Sub-Groups  have  also  been  set  up:  Sub-Group  1  is 
dealing with control and custody; Sub-Group 2 is dealing with control 
and transfer; Sub-Group 3 is dealing with secured transactions, and Sub-Group 4 which has two 
separate  workstreams  dealing  with  taxonomy  and  with  private  international  law  related  matters, 
respectively. 
The Governing Council also decided in favour of an “enhanced” structure for the project which would 
entail the setting up of a Steering Committee on Digital Assets and Private Law in addition to the 
establishment of a Working Group (C.D. (99) B Misc. 2, paras. 7 and 8). It is envisaged that the 
Steering Committee will be comprised of experts from different fields (both technical and legal) and 
is expected to act in a consultative capacity, to allow for wider participation, ensuring all sensitivities 
and  domestic  realities  are  considered,  increase  transparency,  and  provide  invaluable  context-
specific feedback to the Working Group. The Steering Committee will be chaired by Professor Monika 
Pauknerová, member of the UNIDROIT Governing Council. 
• Presentations, seminars and conferences  
On 10 September 2020, Senior Legal Officer Carlo Di Nicola delivered a presentation on the UNIDROIT 
Digital  Assets  and  Private Law  project at the conference “Society,  Law, Artificial  Intelligence  and 
Robotics” (SOLAIR). The SOLAIR 2020 was a continuation of two successful conferences organised 
in September 2018 and in September 2019 and focused on the “Fundamental Rights and Values in 
the Digital Age”. The  conference was organised  by  the  Institute  of  State  and  Law  of  the  Czech 
Academy of Sciences in cooperation with the Government Office of the Czech Republic, the Ministry 
of Industry and Trade of the CR and Microsoft.  
Professor Carmen Tamara Ungureanu, Member of the UNIDROIT Governing Council, presented the 
UNIDROIT project on Artificial Intelligence, Smart Contracts and DLT in the introduction to the fourth 
International  Conference “Legal perspectives on the Internet”, organised at the Faculty of Law 
“Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University of Iasi, Romania on 31 October 2020. She then published an article

1. UNIDROIT/FAO/IFAD Legal Guide on Contract Farming 
Co-authored by UNIDROIT, FAO and IFAD, the UNIDROIT/FAO/IFAD Legal Guide on Contract Farming 
was  published  in  2015  in English and French,  and subsequently translated  in Spanish (2017), 
Portuguese (2017)and Chinese (2018). 
• Presentations, seminars and conferences  
The UNIDROIT/FAO/IFAD Legal Guide on Contract Farming was presented 
and  discussed  at  several  events,  including during  one  of  the break-out 
sessions of the workshop held on 14 February 2020 in Cartagena (Colombia) 
hosted  by  the  Universidad  de  los  Andes  and  co-sponsored  by UNIDROIT, 
UNCITRAL  and  Confcámaras  of  Colombia.  The  break-out  session entitled 
“The impact of the Legal Guide on Contract  Farming  on  the  financing  of 
agricultural production” was  devoted  to  Contract  Farming  and  Warehouse 
Receipt  Financing, and saw the  participation  of  Deputy  Secretary-General 
Anna  Veneziano,  Marek  Dubovec  (NatLaw)  and  Paula  Zuleta  (Colombian 
Ministry of Agriculture). 
In the context of the webinar organised by the OAS on 13 July 2020, discussing improvement of 
access to credit in a post-COVID economy, the Deputy Secretary-General addressed, among other 
issues, the impact of the UNIDROIT/FAO/IFAD Legal Guide on Contract Farming on access to credit.

• Other implementation activities 
UNIDROIT and  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO), and  the 
International  Chamber  of  Commerce  Italy  (ICC  Italy), together  with  Professor  Fabrizio  Cafaggi 
(University  of  Trento,  Italy),  and  in  coordination  with  the  International  Fund  for Agricultural 
Development  (IFAD), are  collaborating  to  prepare  a  joint  document  providing  guidance  on  the 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and similar disastrous events on the performance of food supply 
chain contracts — in particular contract farming arrangements.  
In 2020, UNIDROIT and  its  partners  undertook  research  and  reached  out  to  stakeholders  and 
organisations active in the field (producers and producer organisations, extension service providers, 
and  similar  entities  dealing  primarily  with  agricultural  producers,  law  firms  and  multinational 
companies) to gather information on the legal implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results 
showed  that  the  pandemic  and  the  related  government  actions  to  limit  its  spread  could  hinder 
contractual  performance  by  parties;  that  contracts  at  the  level  of  producers  and  producer 
organisations did not usually contain clauses on force majeure or change of circumstances/hardship 
balancing such risks; and that parties commonly aim to renegotiate their contractual relationships 
informally.  
The  guidance document  being  prepared  aims  to  identify best  practices  and  lessons  learned  from 
national  legal  frameworks  and  practice  in  order  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework  underpinning 
contract farming. It will include analysis, based on the UNIDROIT/FAO/IFAD Legal Guide on Contract 
Farming, on how contract clauses on force majeure, hardship/change of circumstances and remedies 
would apply in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. It will provide guidance for the design or adaptation 
of contractual arrangements to accommodate similar future pandemics, and will provide guidance 
for preparing flexible contracts allowing for the need for adjustments and cooperation in overcoming 
contractual performance difficulties, with a view to promoting a fair balance of risks between the 
contracting parties.  
2. Cape Town Convention and its Protocols 
• Presentations, seminars and conferences  
During 2020 the Cape Town Convention and its Protocols were the focus of a number of conferences, 
seminars and lectures around the world. With particular regard to the activities in which UNIDROIT 
was directly involved, the following are representative examples.  
Between 15–17 February 2020 UNIDROIT participated in several APEC-related meetings in Putrajaya, 
Malaysia. On  15  February  Senior Legal  Officer  William  Brydie-Watson  presented  on  “UNIDROIT 
instruments that support access to credit” at a Workshop for APEC Member Economies on the World 
Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index. The presentation focused on how the Cape Town Convention 
and its Protocols could facilitate access to credit in the Asia-Pacific region.  
On 12 November 2020, the Cape Town Convention and its Protocols were presented in the context 
of  the  conference  co-sponsored  by UNIDROIT, HCCH and UNCITRAL on “International Commercial 
Litigation: Recent Developments and Future Challenges”, organised by the Judicial Policy Research 
Institute (JPRI) and held in Seoul, Korea.

b. Release of the UNIDROIT Secretariat’s Note on the UNIDROIT Principles and the 
COVID-19 health crisis 
On  30  July  2020,  the UNIDROIT Secretariat  published  a Note  on  the  UNIDROIT Principles  of 
International Commercial Contracts and the COVID-19 health crisis. The Note, which benefited from 
the  assistance  of  Professor  Michael  Joachim  Bonell  and  detailed  comments  by  Professor  Marcel 
Fontaine,  as  well  as  further  comments  by  Professor  Bénédicte  Fauvarque-Cosson,  Christopher 
Seppala, Federico Parise Kuhnle and Professor Don Wallace, was aimed at offering guidance, in the 
context  of  the  outbreak  of  COVID-19,  as  to  how  the  Principles  could  help  address  the  main 
contractual disruptions caused by the pandemic directly as well as by the measures adopted as a 
consequence thereof. The Note analysed in particular whether parties may invoke COVID-19 as an 
excuse for non-performance, and if so, based on which concepts and under what conditions (force 
majeure, hardship). The analysis also covered the scenario, likely to be common in practice, where 
performance is still possible, but has become substantially more difficult and/or onerous under the 
circumstances.  The  Principles  offer  parties  and  interpreters  a  much-needed  flexibility  in  such  an 
extreme  context,  constituting  an  efficient  tool  to  offer  nuanced  solutions  that  can  help  preserve 
valuable  contracts  for  the  parties.  Especially  in  mid-to-long  term  contracts,  and  in  view  of  the – 
apparently – temporary  nature  of  the  impediment,  mechanisms  that  allow  for  an  adequate 
renegotiation and proportionate allocation of losses could ultimately help preserve the contract and 
maximise value for the jurisdiction(s) involved. While the Note was not meant to express an official 
position of UNIDROIT on the use or interpretation of the UNIDROIT Principles, it was presented as a 
document for public discussion and elicited much interest and debate. 
4. International Protection of Cultural Property

UNESCO-UNIDROIT  Model  Provisions  on  State  Ownership  of  Undiscovered 
Cultural Objects 
• Status 
On 31 December 2020, there were 49 Contracting States of the UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or 
Illegally  Exported  Cultural  Objects (cf. Annexe II). Côte d’Ivoire ratified the Convention on 23

• 25
th
 anniversary of the 1995 Convention 
UNIDROIT celebrated  the  25
th
 anniversary  of  its  1995  Convention  with  an 
International Conference held in Rome and online on 8 and 9 May 2020. The 
Conference garnered a lot of interest and, despite the pandemic, the hybrid 
format of the conference allowed the participation of over 300 participants 
from all over the world, and an array of prominent speakers and statements 
delivered  by  many  States  party  and  non-party  to  the  Convention. UNIDROIT is  working  at  the 
publication  of the  contributions.  The video of  the  conference available  on UNIDROIT’s YouTube 
Channel.

The Conference was an event to take stock of the achievements of the 
Convention’s implementation thus far, raise awareness on the importance 
of  uniform  laws  for  the  restitution  and  return  of  cultural  property, 
reinforce  synergies  between  the  Convention  and  other  international 
instruments, as well as to explore future steps in the projects aimed at 
promoting    a    favourable    legal    framework    for    the    successful 
implementation of the Convention’s vocation, such as – prominently - the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention 
Academic Project (UCAP).  
Following  the  words  of  welcome  of  President  Maria Chiara  Malaguti  and  General  Riccardi  of  the 
Command of the Carabinieri Unit for the Protection of Cultural Heritage representing Minister Dario 
Franceschini  (Minister  for  Cultural  Heritage  and  Activities  and  for  Tourism), the  opening  session 
featured speeches from UNIDROIT’s many partners in the fight against the illicit trafficking of cultural 
property (such as Webber Ndoro (Director General, ICCROM), H.E. Salim AlMalik (Director General, 
ICESCO), Ernesto Ottone Ramírez (Assistant Director-General for Culture, UNESCO), Corrado Catesi 
(Works of Art Unit Coordinator, INTERPOL), Alberto Garlandini (President ICOM).  
The rich programme of the Conference featured a Keynote Speech on 
the  Impact  of Uniform  Laws  on  the  Protection  of Cultural  Property  by 
Professor  Toshiyuki  Kono  (Executive  Vice  President  and  Distinguished 
Professor, Kyushu University - President ICOMOS), and three sessions. 
Session I focussed on Cultural Objects - Protection and Circulation and 
was  coordinated  by  Manlio  Frigo  (Full  Professor  of  International  Law, 
Milan  Università  degli  Studi – Of  Counsel  BonelliErede),  Session  II  on 
the  Interplay  and  Interdependence  of  Rules  and  Cultural  Instruments 
and moderated by Marina Schneider (Principal Legal Officer and Treaty 
Depositary, UNIDROIT), whereas Session III focussed on Challenges and 
Future Steps and was moderated by Ignacio Tirado (Secretary-General, UNIDROIT). This session gave 
an  opportunity  to  discuss  the  proactive  role that civil  society  can  and  should  play  as  well  as  the 
benefits for all of an enhanced and constructive collaboration with the art market. Joanna van der 
Lande (Antiquities Dealer’s Association) and Martin Wilson (Chief General Counsel at Phillips London) 
explained  how  the  market  evolved  in  the  last  25  years  and  how 
important  the  means  to  enforce  the  law  are.  Bennahi  Lemrabott 
(Minister of Culture, Handicrafts and Relations with the Parliament 
of Mauritania) attended the Conference, together with Nami Salihy 
(Director  of  Heritage  of  Mauritania) to  announce  his  country’s 
decision to accede to the 1995 Convention. 
Other institutions and universities had 
chosen    to    celebrate    the 25
th
 
anniversary of the UNIDROIT 
Convention  by  means  of  conferences 
(often  in  conjunction  with  the 50
th
 
anniversary of the 1970 Convention). 
On  24  and  25  November  2020,  the 
National Heritage Board of Latvia 
organised   an   international   online 
Conference  entitled  “Opportunities 
and Challenges of Art and Antiques Market Management”. The aim of the Conference was to promote 
understanding  among  private  representatives  of  art  and  antiques  trade  about  their  role  in  the 
protection of cultural objects, as well as to promote cooperation between public administration and 
business in the field of cultural objects by strengthening and developing the management of art and 
antiques market. Marina Schneider, Principal Legal Officer and Treaty Depositary at UNIDROIT, took 
part in the opening session.  
Some other events had to be cancelled or postponed to a later date due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
and  the  closure  of  borders.  Such  events  include,  for  example,  the  annual  conference  of  the 
Maastricht Centre for Arts and Culture, Conservation and Heritage (MACCH), which was originally

scheduled in March 2020 in conjunction with the European Fine Arts Fair (TEFAF), entitled “Trust 
and  Transparency  in  the  World  of  Art  and  Heritage  and  its  Practices”;  the  Second  Brazilian 
Conference  on  Law and  Art,  to  be  held  in  João Pessoa  from  20  to  22  May  2020 (but  a thematic 
edition of the Brazilian Journal of International Law, dedicated to Art Law and Cultural Heritage Law 
and celebrating the 25 years of the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention and the 50 years of the 1970 UNESCO 
Convention was published in 2020); as well as the “Symposium on New Directions in the Fight 
against  Cultural  Property  Crime”,  co-organized  by  the  Criminal  Justice  Center  of  Queen  Mary 
University in London, the Department of Sociology of the University of Virginia, the Division of Social 
Sciences of Mount Saint Mary College and the Centre for Heritage of the University of Kent, to be 
held on 13 and 14 July 2020 and postponed to 2021. 
• UNIDROIT celebrated  the  first  International  Day  against  Illicit  Trafficking  in  Cultural 
Property 
14  November – date  of  adoption  of  the  1970  UNESCO  Convention – has  been  chosen  as  the 
International Day against Illicit Trafficking in Cultural Property. UNIDROIT joined UNESCO and others 
to  promote  international  frameworks  for  the  prevention  of  theft  and looting,  and  the  return  of 
illegally traded cultural objects, in parallel with other advances in the fight against illicit trafficking. 
A video was prepared and shared on the UNIDROIT YouTube Channel. 
b. The 1995 UNIDROIT Convention Academic Project 
UNIDROIT was  invited  to  deliver  lectures on  its  instruments  relating  to  cultural  property in  many 
universities and  such activities  are  developed  within  the  framework  of  the UNIDROIT Convention 
Academic Project (UCAP). 
In 2020, the Law Schools Global League (LSGL), an association of 31 top law schools from all five 
continents, joined UCAP as institutional partner and discussions on joint projects are underway.  
C. UNIDROIT and partners in the field of Cultural Property 
UNIDROIT continued to collaborate closely with UNESCO and other organisations such as INTERPOL, 
UNODC, WCO, ICCROM and ICOM and developed new collaborations.  
UNIDROIT has strengthened its links with the judiciary in particular in Latin 
America, and was invited to a webinar organised on 16 June 2020 by the EL 
PAaCTO programme (Europe Latin America Programme of Assistance 
against Transnational Organised Crime) on the theme “Illicit Trafficking 
in Cultural Property in Latin America” and attended by representatives of 
the public prosecutors’ offices of eleven partner countries of the programme 
(Argentina,  Bolivia,  Chile,  Costa  Rica,  Ecuador,  El  Salvador,  Mexico, 
Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay), as well as by the Public Prosecutor’s 
Office  of  Spain. The Secretary-General  of UNIDROIT and  Jorge  Sánchez 
Cordero, Member of the UNIDROIT Governing Council, participated in the online meeting. UNIDROIT 
contributed to a research and analysis paper entitled “Diagnosis of the situation and tools in the 
fight against offences related to illicit trafficking in cultural property”, including the 1995 UNIDROIT 
Convention. 
On  Tuesday  28  July  2020, UNIDROIT participated  in  an  international 
virtual Conference on “Combatting Illicit Trafficking of Cultural Property 
and its Restitution” organised by the Islamic  World  Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (ICESCO), in cooperation with 
the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities in the Arab Republic of Egypt, 
discussing  mechanisms  for  the  fight  against  trafficking  in  cultural 
property.

UNIDROIT was invited to attend the Eighth Session of the Subsidiary Committee of the Meeting of 
States Parties to the UNESCO 1970 Convention (online meeting, 
27 – 28  October  2020). UNIDROIT also  participated  in the 
international  online  Conference  “Cultural  Heritage  and 
Multilateralism:  Regional  and  International  Strategies  for  the 
Protection  of  Cultural  Heritage” (16  to  18  November  2020) 
hosted by the German Federal Foreign Office in partnership with 
UNESCO, the European Union and the Council of Europe. Professor Maria Chiara Malaguti, President 
of UNIDROIT,  participated  on  17  November  in  the  high-level  roundtable celebrating  the  50
th
 
anniversary of the 1970 UNESCO Convention together with Ghada Fathi Waly (Executive Director, 
UNODC);  Kunio  Mikuriya (Secretary  General  WCO) and  Alberto  Garlandini (President  ICOM). 
Professor Malaguti presented the role of UNIDROIT in the fight against the illicit trafficking, highlighted 
some recent major achievements and gave UNIDROIT’s vision for the major challenges that need to 
be addressed in this field. On 18 November, Marina Schneider, Principal Legal Officer and Treaty 
Depositary  at UNIDROIT, participated in the session entitled “Mechanisms to fight trafficking in 
cultural property”. 
d. Training and capacity-building workshops 
UNIDROIT was invited to participate in various capacity-building workshops or other expert meetings 
organised in 2020, including: 
• a workshop organised in Kingston, Jamaica, from 2 to 
5  March  2020  by  the  Jamaican  National  Commission 
for   UNESCO,   the   Ministry   of   Culture,   Gender, 
Entertainment and Sport of Jamaica and the UNESCO 
Cluster  Office  for  the  Caribbean  to  discuss  the  1995 
Unidroit Convention and the 1970 UNESCO Convention 
in view of accession. Government authorities as well as experts from the cultural sector, 
police and customs officials, lawyers and museum directors from the Caribbean Small 
Island   Developing   States   met   to   open   a   dialogue   with   UNESCO   and   Unidroit 
representatives  and  exchange  best  practices  on  the  means  of  preventing  the  illicit 
trafficking  of cultural  property  and  of  submitting  or  receiving  international  restitution 
claims; 
• a sub-regional expert meeting organised by the UNESCO Regional Bureau for Science 
and Culture in Europe entitled “Fighting the illicit traffic of cultural property: Impact-
assessment meeting on seven years of cooperation in South-East Europe” held in Venice

The broad aim of the legal co-operation programme is to promote relations between UNIDROIT and 
Member and non-Member States with a view to achieving the statutory aims of the Organisation. 
Above all, the Programme is designed for countries lacking sufficient resources to participate in the 
legal harmonisation process, particularly developing countries and countries in economic transition. 
It  essentially  focuses  on  the  efforts  undertaken  to  implement  and  disseminate  the  work  of  the 
Institute,  and  provides  training  and  research  opportunities  for  high-level  jurists,  by  means  of  a 
Scholarship Programme. For the Organisation’s institutional relations with Governments (visits and 
seminars in Member and non-Member countries), see supra p. 9. 
1. Co-operation with partner organisations 
The UNIDROIT Secretariat  maintains  close  institutional  co-operation  links  with  a  broad  range  of 
organisations with an international or regional mandate. This includes the exchange of information 
and consultations with respect to topics of common interest, particularly in the framework of the 
Institute’s legislative activities (see supra p. 17). 
2. Internship and Research Scholarship Programme 
Since it was first launched in 1993, the Internship and Research Scholarship Programme has enabled 
the Institute to host over 400 scholars from more than 66 countries with a view to their conducting 
in-depth research on their chosen subject, in line with UNIDROIT’s activities involving uniform law, in 
the Institute Library for an average of two months. 
In 2020, donations were received from the UNIDROIT Foundation, the Ministry of Commerce of the 
People’s Republic of China (MOFCOM), the UNIDROIT Alumni Association, the FeldensMadruga Law 
Firm (Brazil), as well as from Members of the UNIDROIT Governing Council. 
The implementation of the Internship and Research Scholarship Programme in 2020 was significantly 
impacted  by  the  outbreak  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic. Due  to  travel  restrictions  for  international 
students  and professionals,  several  interns  and  scholars  expected  to  conduct  research  at  the 
Institute’s Library in 2020 have deferred their visits to 2021. At the same time, the Library welcomed 
a higher number of independent researchers based in Italy. 
Visiting Scholars 
Under  the  Legal  Co-operation  Programme,  the  Secretariat  has  hosted  three  scholars  from  three 
different countries in 2020: 
Ms JAVADI FARAHZADI Sanaz (Iran), Doctoral Researcher, Fribourg University - Research on: “Contract 
Farming  Geographical  Indications  and  Upgrading  of Small-Scale Producers  in  Global  Agriculture 
Value Chains” – UNIDROIT General Fund Scholarship – Invited researcher (6 July – 4 September 
2020); 
Ms KROLIKOWSKA Katarzyna (Poland), PhD, Warsaw University, Lecturer, Kozminski University and

UNIDROIT website - http://www.unidroit.org 
The UNIDROIT website was first created in the 1990s. In 2012, the Secretariat began work on the 
creation of a new, more user-friendly website. The new website became operative on 10 January 
2014.  The  time  has  come  to  again  review  the  website  completely,  as  the  fast  development  of 
technology and the need to make the website ever more attractive make the preparation of an up-
to-date website necessary, bearing in mind that the architecture of the website and its aesthetic 
appearance must always serve its contents.  
The Secretariat is in the process of scanning and up-loading historic UNIDROIT documents. While the 
new projects are fully accessible on the website, many of the older studies, and also administrative 
documents (Governing Council or General Assembly), are still accessible only on paper. 
The  website  is  monitored  with  Google  Analytics.  Most  users  of  the UNIDROIT website  were  in  the 
United States (10.36%), France (8.87%), the United Kingdom (5.65%) and Italy (5.44%). The first 
Latin  American  country  to be  listed  was  Mexico  in  9
th
 position  with  2.63%  of  the  users,  the  first 
Asian country was India, in 5
th
 position (3.82% of the users), and the first African country Morocco, 
in 28
th
 position (0.77%). Continent by continent, of the first 100 countries from which users came, 
34 were European (Russia and Ukraine included), 7 were Euroasian, 19 Asian, 16 American (North 
and South), 15 African, 6 from the Middle East, and 2 from Oceania. One was unaccounted for. 
The page most consulted was the English page on the UNIDROIT Principles 2016 (7.41% of the pages 
consulted, but it should be noted that individual chapters are recurrently listed separately), followed 
by the page “About UNIDROIT” (3.49%), the page on contracts (2.96%), the Cape Town Convention 
(2.46%), the page on research and internships (1.84%), the status of the Cape Town Convention 
(1.83%),  the  MAC  Protocol  (1.53%),  the UNIDROIT Principles  2010  (1.43%),  the  Aircraft  Protocol 
(1.31),  the 1995  Cultural  Property  Convention (1.12%),  the  page  on  the Member States  of  the 
organisation (1.10%) and the page on the Model Clauses for Use of the Principles (1.07%). The ALI-
UNIDROIT Principles of Transnational Civil Procedure came in 16
th
 position (0.93%), but the work-in-
progress on Transnational Civil Procedure (ELI-UNIDROIT Regional Rules) came only in 52
nd
 position 
(0.26%).  The  agricultural  land  investment  online  consultation  came  in  41
st

users). Most pages consulted were in English. The French pages start in twelfth position with the 

Legal cooperation programme and non-legislative activities 
 41 
general welcome page (1.30%). All in all, as in past years, the pages consulted were varied and 
included older materials, such as the 1973 Wills Convention (20
th
 position, 0.78% of users), and the 
1964 Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the International Sale of Goods (ULIS) (28
th
 position, 
0.52%).  The 1988  Convention  on International  Factoring came  in  22

1988 Convention on International Financial Leasing in 60
th
 position (0.23%). The Model Franchise 
Disclosure Law in English came in 47

Convention was in 44
th
 position with 0.31% of users. Publications came in 25
th
 position, with 0.58% 
of users, and the Uniform Law Review in 53

 position (0.26%). 
UNIDROIT on Social Media  
UNIDROIT launched its social media program during the Institute’s 90
th
 anniversary celebrations in 
April 2016. The purpose of the program is to promote the Institute’s work to a wider audience in an 
innovative, efficient and cost-effective manner. UNIDROIT currently maintains accounts on LinkedIn 
(2016), Facebook (2016), Twitter (2018) and YouTube. At the start of 2019 UNIDROIT relaunched its 
presence on YouTube in order to promote videos of expert presentations made at the Institute by 
international  legal  experts and  visiting  scholars,  as  well  as  to  share  promotional  videos  about 
UNIDROIT instruments and events. 
The three key performance indicators for the Institute’s social media program are: (i) number of 
followers; (ii) the “reach” of the social media program (the total number of people that see UNIDROIT 
social media content); and (iii) the number of referrals to the UNIDROIT website. Since its launch, 
the UNIDROIT social  media  program  has  exceeded  expectations  on  all  three  key  performance 
indicators. In 2020, the Institute had more than 12,500 followers on LinkedIn, 3,900 followers on 
Facebook, and 1,000 followers on Twitter. In relation to the Institute’s “reach” on social media, over 
the past twelve months UNIDROIT content was delivered 133,166 times to people on Facebook, while 
it was displayed on news feeds 412,512 times on LinkedIn, and around 211,800 times on Twitter.  
UNIDROIT participates in a Social Media roundtable organised by the US Mission to the UN Agencies 
in  Rome  which  brings  together  the  social  media  officers  of  the  largest  Rome-based  international 
agencies to share knowledge and coordinate promotional campaigns. This has allowed UNIDROIT to 
benefit from the expertise and experience of larger organisations which have entire teams dedicated 
to digital communication.  
C. DE P O S I T O R Y  LI B R A R I E S   F O R  UN I D R O I T  DO C U M E N T A T I O N 
Before  the  age  of  websites, UNIDROIT asked  Member  States  to  appoint  specific  libraries  or  other 
official institutions to act as Depository Libraries for UNIDROIT documentation and to indicate what 
materials they would be interested in storing (only documents, or also publications, the Uniform Law 
Review, etc.). With the adoption of the policy to post all documentation on the website, the interest 
in Depository Libraries waned, but some States are still keen to maintain them. The list of Member 
States on the website indicates also if Depository Libraries have been appointed. 
At the end of December 2020, 54 libraries in 48 Member States have been designated depositories 
for UNIDROIT documentation. For a list of Depository Libraries see Annexe IV. 
D. UN I D R O I T  LI B R A R Y   
The loss of Walter Rodinò 
It is with profound sadness that UNIDROIT had to mourn the loss of 
Mr Walter Rodinò, who passed away on the morning of 26 March 
2020,  surrounded  by  the  affection  of  his  loved  ones. While  his 
career   saw   him   as former   Deputy   Secretary-General and 
Secretary-General  ad  interim,  his  memory  and  legacy  is  best 
served by recalling him as the heart of the UNIDROIT Library, where 
he served as Director. He was the face that welcomed visitors and 
guests  to  the  Institute  for  over  40  years,  and  the main  reading

room that bears his name since 2016 remains the heart of our academic and institutional life. His 
passing leaves a massive void in the hearts of all his colleagues, both past and present. Our thoughts 
go out to his wife Teresa, his daughter Paola, his sons Luca and David and his entire family. 
Library cooperation and networking 
In  2020  the UNIDROIT Library  continued  its  cooperation  strategy  with  other  Roman  and  foreign 
libraries.  In  particular,  first  steps  have  been  taken  to  create  a  future  collaboration  between  the 
UNIDROIT Library and Library of the IILA (Organizzazione Internazionale Italo-Latinoamericana).  
Library management software upgrading 
The Library’s software  management  system  Aleph500  was  upgraded  to  the  latest  version  Aleph 
23.4.3 without any interruption of services for the Institute’s professional staff or the researchers in 
the Library.  
Digitisation 
On the occasion of the Governing Council’s 97
th
 session, Rome, 2 - 4 May 2018, it was agreed to 
proceed with the proposed in-house digitisation project, as an attractive opportunity to make the 
collection  of  a  large  library,  such  as  the UNIDROIT Library,  accessible  in  digital  form.  In  2020, 
therefore, work progressed on the digitisation project of the Library. In 2020, 281 monographs (115 
titles of the Gorla collection, furthermore 166 titles regarding, in particular, the ‘Chiomenti collection’ 
and  monographs  regarding  comparative  law  and  unification  of  laws,  were  digitally  prepared  and 
added to the Library’s electronic collection. 136 scanned articles were added to the Library’s online 
collection. Special attention was paid to the digitisation of the historical ‘Gorla Collection’ in order to 
preserve one of the Library’s rarest and most valuable historical collections, from the 17
th
 to the 
early part of the 19
th
 Century.  
Update of Law Reviews List 
In 2020, work continued on the upgrade of the Library’s the list of law reviews. The links of those 
publications that are also available online have been included in the relevant bibliographic data sheet 
in the online catalogue. In particular, a large number of articles available in the databases the Library 
is subscribed to, had been added to the bibliographical information of the Library’s online catalogue, 
and can now be easily consulted by readers. 
Acquisitions, donations, exchanges 
In 2020, the Library’s holdings increased by 901 titles, of which 489 were purchased outright, 118 
were obtained on an exchange basis, while 294 further titles were received as gifts for a total value 
of € 11.251,00. The expansion of the Library’s holdings has been hampered by steady increases in 
the price of publications and a chronic lack of resources. In 2020, as in previous years, the Library 
received donations in kind from the Max-Planck-Institute of Foreign Private and Private International 
Law in Hamburg. 
Visitors 
The Library continued, following strong sanitary measures due to the pandemic, to attract readers 
from all over the world. Among the 683 visitors welcomed in 2020, the 32 foreign guests came from 
25 different countries.

The Uniform Law Review  
The Uniform Law Review, published by Oxford University Press (OUP), is available both on paper 
and  online.  Subscriptions  can  be  to  either  or  to  both.  Data  on  subscriptions  indicate  that 
subscriptions to print (i.e. paper) copies have decreased. At the same time, subscriptions to online 
copies  have  increased,  the  greatest  increase  being  to  collection  subscriptions,  i.e.  subscriptions 

Legal cooperation programme and non-legislative activities 
 43 
through  the  OUP  collection  of  journals  available  online.  In  2020  there  were  1,863  collection 
customers with access to the journal via the OUP collection, and 76 customers subscribing outside 
the collection. In addition, the OUP has a special arrangement for developing countries, which offers 
subscriptions to journals online at a low rate, at times cost-free. 
The  visits  to  the  Uniform  Law  Review  pages  on  the  OUP  site  which  include  at  least  one  article 
downloaded, have increased steadily. In 2020 there were an average of 3,241 visits per month. The 
geographical breakdown of the access to Uniform Law Review by region in 2020 was the following: 
Europe (37%), North America (15%), East and South East Asia (11%), Africa (9%), Central and 
South Asia (8%), Oceania (5%), Central and South America (2%), and West Asia (2%). 11% of 
access could not be tracked to its origin. 
Monographs 
• Official  Commentaries  on  the  Cape  Town  Convention  on  International  Interests  in 
Mobile Equipment and its Protocols. 
The  Official  Commentaries  on  the  Cape  Town  Convention  and  its 
protocols are authored by Sir Roy Goode, the Institute acting as agent 
for the author. Until 2019, Sir Roy Goode donated his royalties to the 
UNIDROIT Foundation. In 2019 it was decided that the royalties should 
instead  be  used  to  fund  the  newly  instituted Sir  Roy  Goode UNIDROIT 
Scholarship.  The  Scholarship  provides one  outstanding  post-graduate 
(doctoral) law student, lawyer, academic or government official with the 
opportunity  to  research  in  the UNIDROIT Library  and  work  with  the 
UNIDROIT Secretariat for a period of 6-9 months on a topic related to one 
of  the  Institute’s  high  priority  legislative  projects  or  existing 
instruments.  The Sir  Roy  Goode  Scholarship will  provide  a  unique 
opportunity to gain valuable insights into the methods of private uniform 
law making. 
The fourth edition of the Official Commentary on the Convention on Interests in Mobile Equipment 
and the Protocol thereto on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment was printed in April 2019. The 
draft  Official  Commentary  on  the  Convention  on International  Interests  in  Mobile  Equipment  and 
Protocol thereto on Matters specific to Mining, Agricultural and Construction Equipment has been 
sent  out  for  comments  and  is  expected  to  be  published  early  in  2021.  The  fourth  edition  of  the 
Aircraft Official Commentary exists also in an electronic, pdf version, with internal and external links. 
This was prepared in 2020 following an agreement between the Institute and Aviareto, the Registrar 
of the Cape Town Convention and Protocols, as the latter wanted an electronic version for the users 
of  the  Registry.  Access  to  this  electronic  version  is,  for  the  time  being,  limited  to  users  of  the 
Registry, it is not accessible to anyone else. 
• UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts 2016 
To facilitate distribution of the Principles in Latin America, the Spanish version of the fourth, 2016 
edition of the Principles of International Commercial Contracts was published also in Chile, Colombia, 
Mexico and Paraguay, by the Ediciones Universitarias de Valparaíso (Chile); the Editorial Ibañez and 
the Centro de Estudios de Derecho Comparado (Bogotá, Colombia); the Centro Mexicano de Derecho 
Uniforme A.C. and Instituto de investigaciones jurídicas UNAM (Mexico City, Mexico); and the Centro 
de  estudios  de  derecho,  economía  y  política  (Cedep) and Intercontinental  Editora (Asunción, 
Paraguay). 
In 2020, the UNIDROIT Principles were published in languages other than the official languages of 
the Institute: 
- The Japanese translation, prepared by Mr Takashi Uchida, Professor at Waseda University and 
Emeritus Professor at the University of Tokyo, was published in early 2020; 
- The Russian translation, prepared by Mr Alexander Komarov, Member of the UNIDROIT Governing 
Council, was published late in 2020; and

- The Turkish translation, prepared by a team led by Mr Ergun Özsunay, Emeritus Professor of 
Civil  Law,  Comparative  Law  and  EU Private Law,  Istanbul University Faculty of  Law, was 
published late in December 2020. 
 
• The Future: Electronic publications 
Following  the  positive  reaction  of  the  users  of  the  Aviareto  electronic Registry to  the  electronic 
version  of  the  Official  Commentary  on  the  Cape  Town  Convention  and  Aircraft  Protocol,  the 
possibility of preparing electronic versions for sale also of the other UNIDROIT publications was taken 
up. Considering the nature of the publications, their utility for practicing lawyers and other users 
would be greatly enhanced by a linked, electronic version. This would be the case not only for users 
of the four Official Commentaries, but also of publications such as the UNIDROIT Principles, which 
have a considerable number of internal cross-references, and the Guides prepared specifically with 
practicing lawyers in mind.

Throughout  2020,  the UNIDROIT Foundation  (http://www.unidroitfoundation.org)  continued  to 
support both the substantive and non-legislative work of UNIDROIT.  
UNIDROIT Alumni Association 
In January 2020, with the support of the UNIDROIT Foundation, UNIDROIT 
launched the UNIDROIT Alumni Association, a platform dedicated to 
the  distinguished guests,  which have  been  welcomed  to  the UNIDROIT 
Library  as  part  of UNIDROIT’s  research  scholarship,  internship,  and 
independent  research  programmes. Learn  more  about  the  Alumni 
Association at: https://unidroitfoundation.org/education-and-research/ 
unidroit-alumni-association/  
The Annual Membership fee is 50 euros for lawyers, jurists, academics, 
and others, and 25 Euros for young professionals and students (under the age of 35 on 1 January 
2020). 
Proceeds from the UNIDROIT Alumni Association will go towards supporting the UNIDROIT Internship 
and  Research  Scholarship  Programme  to  allow  more  young  professionals  and  students  from 
developing countries to come to Rome and undertake their legal research. 
UNIDROIT COVID-19 Essay Competition 
In July 2020, supported by the law firm Stibbe, and facilitated by the UNIDROIT Foundation, UNIDROIT 
organised  the UNIDROIT COVID-19  Essay Competition inviting  contributions  examining  the  impact 
and usefulness of UNIDROIT instruments either during the COVID-19 pandemic, or in the post COVID-
19 economy.  
A  webinar  was  subsequently  organised  to  celebrate  the  winners  of  the  competition  on  11  March 
2021. Watch the webinar at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n64vLPwxc98&t. 
The   6
th
 Workshop   of   the   Economic   Assessment   of   International 
Commercial  Law  Reform  Project  was  held  on  8  September  at  the 
UNIDROIT Headquarters  in  Rome.  Due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  the 
meeting was held in hybrid format, with 10 participants present at the 
Institute,  25  remote  participants  and  over  30  remote  observers.  The 
project  is  managed  under  the  auspices  of  the Cape  Town  Convention 
Academic Project, in partnership with the UNIDROIT Foundation, and the Aviation Working Group. Its 
primary  purpose  is  to  develop a  framework  for  conducting  economic  analyses  of  international 
commercial  law  reform.  The  project  involves  stakeholders  from  all  segments  of  the  law  reform 
process, including international and national policy makers and standards setters, academic experts, 
international economists and officials of intergovernmental organisations. Building on the outcomes 
of the fifth workshop in April 2019, the 6
th
 workshop further explored the relationship between the 

Legal cooperation programme and non-legislative activities 
 45 
framework’s  variables  and  how  the  framework  is  to  be applied  during  different  phases  of  a 
commercial law reform project. Participating experts also discussed the content of the practical guide 
being developed alongside the framework. A report for the Workshop will be published in the coming 
months. 
The  4
th 
Workshop  for  project  on  Best  Practices  in  the  Field  of 
Electronic Registry Design and Operation took place at the UNIDROIT 
Headquarters  in  Rome  on  9  September.  Due  to  the  COVID-19 
pandemic the meeting was held in hybrid format, with 9 participants 
present at the Institute, 42 remote participants, and over 20 remote 
observers. It is run under the auspices of the Cape Town Convention 
Academic  Project,  in  partnership  with  the UNIDROIT Foundation, 
Aviareto, and the Aviation Working Group, with the aim of providing guidance on the design and 
operation  of  electronic  registries. To  assess  best  practice,  this project  has  identified  Critical 
Performance Factors (CPFs) against which electronic registries can be measured. The project brings 
together  international  stakeholders  with  expertise  in  the  design, 
operation and evaluation of different types of electronic registries, 
including government representatives, officials from regional and 
intergovernmental  organisations,  policy  makers,  private  sector 
experts  and  academics.  The  fourth  workshop  built  upon  earlier 
workshops  in  2018  and  2019,  and  provided  an  opportunity  to 
evaluate the project’s progress, share international experiences, 
and  identify  common  problems  associated  with  the  design  and 
operation of electronic registries. A report for the Workshop will be 
published in the coming months.
