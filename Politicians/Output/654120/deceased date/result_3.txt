2017: A salute to a remarkable Captain 
 
 
As  regular  readers  will  note, UNIDROIT has  a  history  of  utilising  metaphors  to  summarise  the 
Institute’s activities at the beginning of each year’s Annual Report. While the tradition was started by 
Secretary-General Herbert Kronke, it was ably continued by Secretary-General José Angelo Estrella Faria. 
In honour of Mr Estrella Faria’s service to the Institute, I take this opportunity to renew the maritime theme 
he adopted in the Annual Reports of 2012 and 2013. 
In July 2017 Secretary-General Estrella Faria resigned his post after nine years at the keel. During 
his tenure, Mr Estrella Faria navigated UNIDROIT through both stormy conditions and calm seas with great 
ability. Under his leadership, the Institute advanced its core mission to deliver and implement high quality 
instruments.  In  addition,  the  Secretary-General’s  captaincy  saw  the  Institute  diversify  its  Work 
Programme, strengthen its relationships with partner organisations and modernise its internal operations. 
In many ways, 2017 reflected the principal elements of the Secretary-General’s command, as the 
Institute experienced great success in the delivery of quality instruments, inter-organisation cooperation 
and improvements in internal administration.  
The  crowning  achievement  of  2017 was  the  adoption  of  the UNIDROIT Legislative  Guide  on 
Intermediated Securities (Legislative Guide) by the Governing Council during its 96
th
 session (Rome, 10-
12 May 2017). A key component in the Institute’s work in the area of capital markets, the Legislative Guide 
will play an important role in assisting States in their consideration of the Convention on Substantive Rules 
regarding  Intermediated  Securities  (Geneva,  5-9  October  2009)  and  its  key  principles  and  rules  for 
improving the legal framework for holding and transferring such securities. Before its consideration by the 
Governing Council, the Legislative Guide was recommended for adoption by the Committee on Emerging 
Market Issues, Follow-Up and Implementation at its fourth meeting in Beijing (29-30 March 2017) and is 
available as of this writing in English, French, Chinese and Spanish.  
Another of the Institute’s prosperous voyages in 2017 was the continued work on a fourth Protocol 
to the Cape Town Convention on International Interests on Mobile Equipment on Matters specific to Mining, 
Agricultural  and  Construction  Equipment  (the  MAC  Protocol).  The  Committee  of  Governmental  Experts 
entrusted  with  preparing  a  draft  text  met  twice  in  2017,  with  both  sessions  attracting  over  120 
representatives  from  various  States  and  international  organisations.  Interest  in  the  project  from  the 
international  community  was  partially  driven  by  the  completion  of  a  preliminary  economic  analysis  in 
September 2017, which projected that the MAC Protocol will have significant economic benefits  in both 
developing and developed nations.  
The  Secretariat  also  continued  to  make  great  progress  in  implementing  the  Institute’s  Work 
Programme  for  the  2017-2019  triennium,  especially  in  relation  to  the  preparation  of  an  international 
guidance  document  on  agricultural  land  investment  contracts  and  the  development  of  regional  rules  of 
European civil procedure. Both projects are being delivered in collaboration with other organisations and 
institutions – the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  and  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural 
Development for the former and the European Law Institute for the latter – and are the type of partnerships 
that are a hallmark of Secretary-General Estrella Faria’s era.

It  is  also  noteworthy  that  at  its 76
th
 session  (Rome,  7  December  2017),  the  General  Assembly 
approved important reforms to the Institute’s staff compensation, pension and insurance schemes. This 
concluded an extensive Finance Committee process which ensures that these schemes are fair, transparent 
and efficient.  
Secretary-General Estrella Faria’s work over the past nine years has made certain that the good ship 
UNIDROIT is well equipped and provisioned to undertake expeditions long into the future. It has been an 
honour to lead the Institute as Secretary-General ad interim, and I am thankful to the very able “crew” at 
the Secretariat who have worked hard to ensure that the transitional period has been smooth sailing.

1. Presidency and Governing Council 
The 96

 was held in Rome from 10 to 10 May 2017 under the 
chairmanship of the President of the Institute, Professor Alberto Mazzoni. The Governing Council, 
after approving the Secretary-General’s report on the activity of the Institute in 2016, appointed M. 
Arthur Hartkamp as First Vice-President, and renewed Professor Lyou Byung-Hwa as Second Vice-
President until its 97
th
 session.  
Following the decision taken by the Governing Council at its 90
th
 session (Rome, 9-11 May 2011) to 
make systematic use of the authority given to it by article 16 of the UNIDROIT Regulations to request 
representatives of member Governments that have no nationals sitting on the Council to attend its 
meetings in a consultative capacity. 14 such Member States were represented at the 96

the Council. 
When  discussing  the  draft budget  for  2017,  the  Council  commended  the  positive  impact  of  cost-
saving measures and management efficiencies have had.  
The  Governing  Council  approved the  re-appointment  of  the  Deputy  Secretary-General,  Professor 
Anna Veneziano, for a second term beginning 1 October 2017. The Council congratulated the Deputy 
Secretary-General and thanked her for her significant contributions to the work of the Institute. 
The Council finally noted that the Secretary-General’s appointment would expire on 30 September 
2018 and, as he expressed his unavailability to accept re-appointment, the Council authorised the 
Permanent Committee to begin the selection process for a successor to the Secretary-General, so 
as to be able to submit a nomination to the Council at its 97

“International Commercial Law Today: Old Habits and New Challenges”. 
On 10 October 2017, UNIDROIT was invited to participate in the session panel on “Agricultural supply 
chains in Southeast Asia: legal considerations from ‘farm to the fork’” in the framework of the Annual 
IBA Conference in Sydney to discuss ‘Developments of contract farming in South Eastern Asia’. Ms 
Frederique Mestre, Senior Legal Officer, discussed ‘Developments of contract farming in South 
Eastern Asia’ focusing on good practices in contract farming to support sustainable economic and 
social development. 
On 2 and 3 November 2017, the 9
th
 Transnational Commercial Law Teachers’ Meeting took place at 
Radboud University in Nijmegen. Beyond many topics of particular relevance to UNIDROIT, such as 
the  Cape  Town  Convention  and  its  Protocols  as  well  as  indirectly  held  securities,  the  Secretary-

General a.i., Professor Anna Veneziano, was a moderator on a panel concerning UNIDROIT’s work on 
Contract Farming and Land Investment Contracts, which involved a presentation by Professor Henry 
Gabriel (Elon School of Law and UNIDROIT Governing Council Member). 
Members  of  the  Secretariat  also  participated  in  various  meetings  and  conferences  where  they 
presented  the UNIDROIT instruments  and  the  work  of  the  Institute  in  general.  Details  of  some  of 
these meetings are set out elsewhere in this report. 
Cooperation with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
On  24  and  25  February  2017, UNIDROIT represented by  Mr  William-Brydie  Watson,  Legal  Officer, 
provided  legal  expertise  at  an Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  Seminar  on  the  use  of 
International Instruments to Strengthen Contract Enforcement in Supply Chain Finance for Global 
Businesses in Nha Trang, Viet Nam. The seminar was sponsored by the Hong Kong Department of 
Justice and held under the auspices of the APEC Economic Committee's "Strengthening Economic 
Legal Infrastructure" Group. 
In July 2017, following successful cooperation in Peru in 2016 and in Viet Nam in 2017, the APEC 
member  economies  have  granted UNIDROIT a  three-year  guest  status  in  the  APEC  Economic 
Committee. 
Cooperation with the Global Forum on Law, Justice and Development (GFLJD)  
A partner of the Global Forum on Law, Justice and Development (GFLJD) – an initiative of the World 
Bank Legal Vice-Presidency - and a member of its Steering Committee, and as a follow up to UNIDROIT’s 
preliminary work toward the preparation of a legal regimen governing social enterprises carried out in 
2010, UNIDROIT joined the GFLJD Project “The Human-Centered Business Model (HCBM): A Holistic 
Approach to a New Model for Doing Business”. The Project aims to bridge the gap between for-profit 
and non-profit models of doing business. In accordance with the Governing Council’s decision at its 
96
th
 session  (10-12  May 2017) UNIDROIT agreed  to  take  a  co-leading  role  with  the  University  of 
Florence for the second pillar of the project, which focuses on legal frameworks and governance. The 
UNIDROIT Secretariat  has  provided  support  to  the  project  with  preliminary  research  work  and  the 
participation in promotion events together with a broad range of interested stakeholders, aiming at 
eliciting the interest of sponsoring institutions for the project. 
On 17 February 2017, UNIDROIT hosted an event organised with other partners of the GFLJD, under 
the patronage of the Italian Agency for Cooperation for Development. On 22 November 2017, Professor 
Alberto  Mazzoni,  President  of UNIDROIT,  and  Ms  Frederique  Mestre, UNIDROIT Senior  Legal  Officer, 
participated in a meeting in Paris organised and hosted by the Conseil Supérieur du Notariat, with the 
support of the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs. 
2. Co-operation agreements 
In 2017, UNIDROIT signed several co-operation agreements with the following different institutions:

1. Private Law and Agricultural Development  
Preparation of an international guidance document on agricultural land investment 
contracts 
At its 95
th
 session (Rome, 18-20 May 2016), the Governing Council considered the feasibility study 
that had been prepared by the Secretariat (UNIDROIT 2016 – C.D. (95) 7(b)) and took note of it, 
ultimately deciding to recommend to the General Assembly that it retain work on an international 
guidance document on agricultural land investment contracts in the UNIDROIT Work Programme for 
the  2017-2019  triennium  with  a  high  level  of  priority. The  General  Assembly  endorsed  that 
recommendation at its 75
th
 session (Rome, 1 December 2016). 
Consistent  with  the  high  level  of  priority,  the  Working  Group  on  agricultural  land  investment 
contracts was constituted and held two meetings in 2017. The Working Group is chaired by Mr José 
Antonio Moreno Rodríguez, a member of the UNIDROIT Governing Council, and currently includes: Mr 
Lorenzo  Cotula,  Principal  Researcher  in  Law  and  Sustainable  Development  at  the  International 
Institute for Environment and Development (IIED); Mr Daryono, Professor at Universitas Terbuka, 
Jakarta; Ms Bénédicte Fauvarque-Cosson, Professor at Université Paris 2; Mr James Gathii, Wing-
Tat Lee Chair in International Law and Professor of Law at Loyola University Chicago School of Law; 
Ms Jean Ho, Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore; Mr Pierre-Etienne Kenfack, 
Professor  at Université Yaoundé  2;  and  Ms  Yuliya  Panfil,  Associate,  Investments  at  the  Omidyar 
Network.  The  Working  Group  also  includes  representatives  of  FAO;  IFAD;  the  International  Land 
Coalition, a global alliance of civil society and farmers’ organisations, UN agencies, NGOs and 
research  institutes;  the  World  Farmers  Organisation,  made  up  of  national  producer  and  farm 
cooperative  organisations;  and  the  Private  Sector  Mechanism  at  the  Committee  on  World  Food 
Security (CFS), which provides views on behalf of the wider private sector. 
At the Working Group’s first meeting (Rome, 3-5 May 2017), the Working Group began by discussing 
various  general  matters,  including: UNIDROIT and  its  work  on  private  law  and  agricultural 
development; alignment of the work with existing initiatives, in particular the Voluntary Guidelines 
on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the context of National 
Food  Security  (VGGT)  and  the  Principles  for  Responsible  Investment  in  Agriculture  and  Foods 
Systems  (CFS-RAI  Principles); co-operation  with  the  UN  agricultural  development  agencies,  non-
governmental organisations, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders; and the possible 
scope, structure and target audience of the future instrument. Following those general discussions, 
the Working Group reviewed a preliminary draft outline of the future instrument on agricultural land 
investment contracts, which had been prepared by the UNIDROIT Secretariat for discussion purposes. 
The  Group  amended  and  provided  expert  input  on  the  initial  outline,  which  would  be  subject  to 
ongoing review.  
At  the  Working  Group’s  second  meeting  (Rome,  13-15  September  2017),  the Working  Group 
discussed recent developments and general considerations in relation to the work, in particular with 
respect to the future instrument’s scope and target audience and its alignment to existing initiatives. 
In  this  regard,  the  Working  Group  recommended  that,  subject  to  ongoing  review,  the  future 
instrument should be a guide focusing on leases and concessions of agricultural land and that the 
guidance should be targeted to not just legal counsels for investors, but legal counsels for the various 
parties involved in those contracts. The Working Group then examined in detail an updated draft 
outline of the future instrument and initial draft contributions for certain chapters. Regarding the 
organisation  of  future  work,  the  Working  Group  considered  possible  events  and  other  means  for 
raising awareness about the work, consulting stakeholders and seeking their input. It then decided 
that the third meeting would be held in Rome on 25-27 April 2018.

In addition, the Secretariat organised a second informal meeting that was held – in collaboration 
with FAO and IFAD – with experts and interested stakeholders at FAO on 11 October 2017 during 
the CFS’ 44
th
 plenary  session.  Like  the  previous  informal  meeting,  which was  held  at  FAO  on  20 
October 2016 during the CFS’ 43
rd
 plenary session, the meeting raised awareness about UNIDROIT’s 
work in this area and solicited input on the scope, target audience, form and content of the future 
instrument on agricultural land investment contracts. Participants reviewed and commented on the 
draft  outline,  and  the  input  received  was  provided  to  the  Working  Group  for  its  consideration  in 
preparing the future guide on agricultural land investment contracts. 
2. International Interests in Mobile Equipment  
a. Space Protocol to the Cape Town Convention 
Preparatory Commission for the establishment of an International Registry 
Pursuant to Resolution  1 of  the diplomatic Conference for the adoption of the draft Protocol to the 
Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Space Assets (Berlin, 
27 February-9 March 2012), a Preparatory Commission was set up to act as Provisional Supervisory 
Authority for the establishment of the International Registry for Space Assets under the guidance of 
the UNIDROIT General Assembly. The Commission is chaired by Sergio Marchisio, former Chairman of 
the Commission of the Whole at the Berlin Conference and the following States agreed to serve as 
members of the Preparatory Commission: Brazil, the People’s Republic of China, the Czech Republic, 
France,  Germany,  India,  Italy,  the  Russian  Federation,  Saudi  Arabia,  South  Africa  and  the  United 
States of America.  
The fifth session of the Preparatory Commission for the establishment of the International Registry for 
Space  Assets  was  held  in  Rome  on  6  December  2017. The  Commission  convened  to  discuss  the 
progress in, the appointment of a Supervisory Authority and the selection of the Registrar as well as 
a series of future promotional events for 2018. 
b. Luxembourg Rail Protocol to the Cape Town Convention  
Preparatory Commission for the establishment of an International Registry 
A Preparatory Commission was established by Resolution 1 of the Luxembourg diplomatic Conference 
in order to prepare the International Registry under the Rail Protocol. The Preparatory Commission, at 
its 7
th
 Session held in Rome in December 2014, set up a special Ratification Task Force. The Ratification 
Task  Force  (composed,  for  the  time  being,  of  the  Co-Chairs  of the  Preparatory  Commission,  the 
Government  of  Luxembourg,  representatives  of  the  Rail  Working  Group,  Regulis  SA  as  designated 
Registrar and SITA as well as OTIF and UNIDROIT) set up an intense agenda for its work and continued 
to meet several times (mostly through teleconference) also during 2017, with the aim of coordinating 
the strategy towards early implementation of the Protocol. 
In particular, the Ratification Task Force met in Rome on 27 September 2017 to discuss the progress 
of  ratification  in  key  countries.  The  meeting  was  honoured  by  the  presence  of  H.E.  Paul  Dühr, 
Ambassador of Luxembourg to Italy. Professor Anna Veneziano, Secretary-General a.i. of UNIDROIT, 
and Mr Peter Bloch, co-chair of the Preparatory Commission and Ratification Task Force, opened the 
meeting, in which Mr Howard Rosen (Chairman, Rail Working Group), Ms Elizabeth Hirst (Managing 
Director,  Regulis  SA),  and  Mr  Andy  Smith  (SITA),  were  present.  The  Secretary-General  of  the 
Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF), Mr François Davenne, and 
the  Head  of  Finance  and  Administration  of  OTIF,  Mr  Gousébasha  Gaffar,  and  Rail  Working  Group 
Secretary Mr Martin Fleetwood, participated via remote connection.

c. Preparation  of  a  future  Protocol  to  the  Cape  Town  Convention  on Matters 
specific to Mining, Agricultural and Construction equipment 
At its 95
th
 session  (Rome,  18–20 May 2016), the Governing Council  requested that the UNIDROIT 
Secretariat convene a Committee of Governmental Experts for the preparation of a draft Protocol to 
the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters specific to Agricultural, 
Construction and Mining Equipment (“MAC Protocol”).  
The first session of the Committee of Governmental Experts was held at the headquarters of the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome from 20-24 March 2017. 
The  session  was  attended by  126  representatives  from  48  Governments  (30 UNIDROIT member 
States  and  18  non-member  States),  six  regional  and  intergovernmental  organisations  and  four 
international non-governmental organisations. 
At the first session, the Committee of Governmental Experts made strong progress in reviewing the 
preliminary draft text provided by the Study Group, and the majority of the text proposed by the 
Study Group was adopted by the Committee. The most debated issues were: (a) the scope of the 
Protocol in relation to MAC equipment; (b) how the Protocol should address interests arising out of 
the association of MAC equipment with immovable property; and (c) the amendment procedure for 
the Protocol, with particular regard to the Harmonized System codes (“HS codes”) contained in the 
Annexes  to  the  preliminary  draft  Protocol.  At  the  end  of  the  session,  the  Committee  decided  to 
establish an Intersessional Working Group on Registration Criteria, which was tasked with preparing 
a new draft Article XVI.  
After the first session, the Secretariat supported the operation of the Working Group on Registration 
Criteria and prepared additional legal analysis for consideration by the Committee of Governmental 
Experts. On the request of the Committee, the Secretariat also commissioned a team of economists 
to conduct an economic impact analysis on the MAC Protocol. The economic analysis was majority 
funded by the MAC Protocol Working Group, which represents private sector interests in the MAC 
Protocol project. 
The second session of the Committee of Governmental Experts was held at FAO’s in Rome from 2-
6  October  2017.  126  representatives  from  51  Governments,  six  regional  and  intergovernmental 
organisations  and  three  international  non-governmental  organisations  registered  to  attend  the 
meeting.  During  the  session,  further  refinements  were  made  to  the  MAC  Protocol.  In  particular, 
additional provisions were inserted to address private sector concerns regarding how the Protocol 
would deal with inventory. The Committee also adopted amendments to Article XVI, as proposed by 
the Intersessional Working Group on Registration Criteria.  
At the end of the session, the Committee of Governmental Experts adopted the preliminary draft 
MAC  Protocol  and  made  a  recommendation  to  the UNIDROIT Governing  Council that  a  Diplomatic 
Conference  be  convened  to  conclude  the  MAC  Protocol.  The  Governing  Council  will  consider  the 
preliminary draft Protocol adopted by the Committee at its 97
th
 session in May 2018.  
As part of its strategy to maximise engagement with the MAC Protocol and attendance at the future 
Diplomatic Conference, the Secretariat undertook missions to Budapest in November 2017 and Cairo 
in December 2017 to assist Hungary and Egypt in their consideration of the preliminary draft text.   
d. Preparation of other Protocols to the Cape Town Convention 
On recommendation from the Governing Council, the General Assembly at its 75
th
 session (Rome, 
1  December  2016)  decided  to include  on  the  Institute’s  2017–2019  Work  Programme  the 
preparation of additional Protocols to the Cape Town Convention on matters specific to (i) ships and 
maritime transport equipment, and (ii) renewable energy equipment. Both projects were assigned 
a low priority by the General Assembly.  
For ships and maritime equipment, the Secretariat continued to monitor developments in this area. 
This  includes  the  ongoing  work  by  an  International  Working  Group  of  the Comité  Maritime 
International (CMI),  which  has  collected  from  various  jurisdictions – via  a  questionnaire  made 
available  in  April  2016 – information  regarding  maritime  security  interest  practices  and  industry

needs and for which a progress update was provided at CMI’s recent General Assembly meeting 
(Genoa, 7-8 September 2017).

As consistent with its low priority, in 2017 a limited amount of research was undertaken to assess 
the viability of extending the Cape Town Convention to renewable energy equipment. The research 
undertaken  focused  on  core  issues  such  as  (i)  whether  an  asset-based  financing  treaty  was 
appropriate  in  facilitating  the  financing  of  renewable  energy  projects,  (ii)  whether  extending  the 
Cape  Town  Convention  would  support  ongoing  activities  by  other  international  organisations  in 
promoting renewable energy and (iii) whether there was private sector support for the project. 
3. Transnational Civil Procedure – Formulation of Regional Rules 
In 2014, UNIDROIT and the European Law Institute (ELI) agreed on a Memorandum of Understanding 
specifically  related  to  a  project  on  European  civil  procedure  rules  based  on  the  American  Law 
Institute (ALI) – UNIDROIT Principles of Transnational Civil Procedure. A Steering Committee was set 
up,  co-chaired  by  ELI  President  Diana  Wallis  and  the UNIDROIT Secretary-General  José  Angelo 
Estrella Faria and composed of representatives of both organisations and of Reporters for the first 
three Working Groups that were established (“Access to information and evidence” “Provisional and 
protective measures” and “Service of documents and due notice of proceedings”). Two additional 
Working Groups were established during the 2014 plenary meeting of the Steering Committee and 
the Working Group members on the topics of “Lis pendens and res judicata” and “Obligations of the 
parties and lawyers”. Finally, between 2015 and 2016, three other groups (respectively on “Costs”, 
“Judgments” and “Parties in the proceedings”) were set up, so as to provide coverage of most of 
the issues addressed in the ALI-UNIDROIT Principles and for which European rules were considered 
to be both useful and feasible. Finally, a horizontal “Structure” Working Group was established, with 
participation  of  two  members  of  the  Steering  Committee  and  with  the  aim  of  coordinating  the 
preparation of the consolidated text of the rules. 
Steering  Committee  Members,  Co-Reporters  and  members  of  the  Working  Groups  of  the  ELI-
UNIDROIT joint  project  convened  on  5-7  April  2017  in  Rome  to  discuss  issues  pertaining  to  the 
finalisation of the drafts of the first three Working Groups and progress drafts and reports of the 
other Working Groups, as well as the formal establishment of a sub-group on Appeals On the first 
day, the Working Group on “Structure” discussed, together with the Steering Committee and 
representatives of Co-Reporters of the Working Groups, the consolidated text of three final drafts 
on “Service and due notice of proceedings”, “Access to information and evidence” and “Provisional 
and protective measures”, as well as general points regarding project coordination. 
The official part of the Joint Steering Committee Meeting with Members of the Project took place on 
the  next  two  days,  under  the  chairmanship  of  the  Secretary  General  of UNIDROIT,  José  Angelo 
Estrella Faria, and the ELI President, Diana Wallis. All  Members of the Steering Committee were 
present as well as Co-reporters and numerous Members of all of the Project’s Working Groups.  
On 7 September 2017, the ELI-UNIDROIT project was presented at the 2017 ELI Annual Conference 
in Vienna. ELI President Diana Wallis and Secretary-General ad interim of UNIDROIT Anna Veneziano 
co-chaired a panel of the “Structure” Group. The panel presented the first consolidated draft of the 
Rules  resulting  from  the  work  of  the  first  three  Working  Groups  (Provisional  and  Protective 
Measures, Access to Information and Evidence, and Service of Documents), which had already been 
presented to the UNIDROIT Governing Council at its 96
th
 session on 10-12 May 2017. 
On  16-17  November 2017,  Steering  Committee  members,  Co-Reporters  and  Members  of  the 
Working Groups, as well as Advisers and Observers convened in the Palais Trautson of the Austrian 
Ministry of Justice for a plenary meeting. During the two-day event, Members of the Project heard 
presentations  and  debated  on  such  topics  as res  judicata and  pendency,  parties,  costs,  and 
judgments in civil procedure. The overarching working group “Structure” also presented an updated 
version of the consolidated draft of European Principles of civil procedure, encompassing the work 
of the first three Working Groups of the Project (access to information and evidence, provisional

4. UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts  
a. Formulation of Principles of Reinsurance Contracts 
In July 2015, the Secretariat was approached by a group of scholars and practicing lawyers led by 
Professor Anton K. Schnyder and Professor Helmut Heiss (University of Zurich, as "Lead Agency"), 
Professor  Martin  Schauer  (University  of  Vienna)  and  Professor  Manfred  Wandt  (University  of 
Frankfurt),  who  were  examining  the  feasibility  of  formulating  "Principles  of  Reinsurance  Contract 
Law"  (PRICL).  The  purpose  of  the  project  is  to  formulate  a  “restatement”  of  existing  global 
reinsurance law, which is largely embedded in international custom and usage, but is seldom the 
object  of  legislation.  The  project  leaders  expressed  the  view  that  the  proposed  principles 
presupposed the existence of adequate rules of general contract law. Rather than attempting to re-
create such rules, the proposed new principles should be drafted as a “special part” of the UNIDROIT 
Principles of International Commercial Contracts. With a view to ensuring consistency between the 
PRICL and the UNIDROIT Principles, UNIDROIT was invited to participate. 
The  Governing  Council  decided  to  recommend  this  topic  for  inclusion  in  the UNIDROIT Work 
Programme for the triennium 2017-2019 by the General Assembly, and recommended to assign it 
with a low level of priority. The General Assembly endorsed this recommendation of the Governing 
Council at its 75
th
 session, on 1 December 2016. 
In 2017, the Secretary General, Mr José Angelo Estrella Faria, actively participated in two workshops 
held in Frankfurt (8-12 March 2017) and Zurich (28 June-1 July 2017).  
b. UNILEX 
The UNILEX database, with Mr Michael Joachim Bonell, emeritus professor, University of Rome I, 
and Consultant, UNIDROIT, as Editor-in-Chief, is accessible through the UNIDROIT website as well as 
directly. It has two sections, one on the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International 
Sale  of  Goods  (CISG)  (Vienna,  1980),  the  other  on  the UNIDROIT Principles  on  International 
Commercial Contracts. They include analysed and classified case law and bibliographies, as well as 
the  texts  of  the  instruments.  Both  sections  are  updated  regularly.  The  section  on  the UNIDROIT 
Principles was updated in 2017 with the text of the UNIDROIT Principles 2016. To date, it has a total 
of 234 cases decided by national courts in 30 countries plus the Court of Justice of the European 
Communities,  the Economic  Court  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  (CIS),  the 
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and the Iranian-U.S. Arbitral 
Tribunal, and 194 decisions by arbitral tribunals, including the ICC International Court of Arbitration 
and the Permanent Court of Arbitration.  
The UNILEX database is consulted extensively, its analytical apparatus facilitating consultation and 
offering a value-added product. 
5. International Sales Law 
Preparation  of  a  guidance  document  on  existing  texts  in  the  area  of  international 
sales  law  in  cooperation  with  UNCITRAL  and  the  Hague Conference  on  Private 
International Law 
On 14 December 2015, the Secretariat received a communication from the Secretariat of the United 
Nations  Commission  on  International  Trade  Law  (UNCITRAL)  inviting UNIDROIT and  the  Hague 
Conference on Private International Law to cooperate on a project for the “creation of a roadmap to 
the  existing  texts  in  the  area  of  international  sales  law  (sales  contracts)  prepared  by  each 
organisation, primarily the CISG, the UNIDROIT Principles, and the Hague Principles, and providing 
an assessment  of  interactions  between  the  texts,  their  actual  and  potential  use, application,  and 
impact, all with the goal to facilitate promotion of their appropriate use, uniform interpretation, and 
adoption.”  
The  Governing  Council  decided  to  recommend  this  topic  for  inclusion  in  the UNIDROIT Work 

Legislative activities 
 17 
Programme for the triennium 2017-2019 by the General Assembly, and proposed to assign it a high 
level  of  priority.  The  General  Assembly  endorsed  this  recommendation  at  its  75
th
 session,  on  1 
December 2016. 
During  2017,  the  small  joint  panel  of  experts  established  by  the  three  organisations  held  a 
teleconference  on  18  July, followed  by  a  meeting  generously  hosted  by  Working  Group  Member 
Stefan Vogenhauer at the Max Planck Institute for European Legal History in Frankfurt on 25 October 
2017. The Group of Experts as well as representatives of the three Secretariats met with the aim to 
clarify  scope,  methodology  and  timeline  of  the  project.  The  meeting  saw  the  participation  of 
Professor  Anna  Veneziano (UNIDROIT Secretary-General a.i.),  Mr  Luca  Castellani  (Legal  Officer - 
UNCITRAL),  Ms  Ning  Zhao  (Senior  Legal  Officer - HCCH),  as well  as  Professors  Pilar  Perales 
Viscasillas  (Universidad  Carlos  III  de  Madrid),  Hiroo  Sono  (Hokkaido  University,  School  of  Law), 
Lauro  Gama  (Binenbojm,  Gama  &  Carvalho  Britto  Advogados),  and  the  remote  participation  of 
Professor Neil Cohen (Brooklyn Law School). 
6. Transactions on international and connected capital markets  
UNIDROIT Legislative Guide on Intermediated Securities 
The final session of the diplomatic Conference to adopt a Convention on Substantive Rules regarding 
Intermediated Securities (Geneva, 5-9 October 2009), inter alia, adopted the UNIDROIT Convention 
on Substantive Rules for Intermediated Securities (“Geneva Securities Convention”) and established 
a  Committee  on  Emerging  Markets  Issues,  Follow-Up and Implementation (“Emerging Markets 
Committee”) to assist with the Convention’s promotion and implementation. The Emerging Markets 
Committee  has  been  responsible  for  overseeing  the  preparation  of  a  draft  Legislative  Guide 
containing principles and rules capable of enhancing trading in securities in emerging markets, which 
is a high priority item in UNIDROIT’s Work Programme for the triennium 2017-2019. 
The Emerging Markets Committee held its fourth meeting (Beijing, 29-30 March 2017) at the kind 
invitation  of  the  China  Securities  Regulatory  Commission,  who  hosted  jointly  with  the  China

Pennsylvania), Mr Luc Thévenoz (Professor of Law, University of Geneva), and Ms Wu Jing (Senior 
Manager, Legal Department, China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation). In reviewing 
the  draft  Legislative  Guide – which  had been  twice  circulated  for  comments  from  States, 
organisations   and   stakeholders – the Emerging   Markets   Committee   agreed   upon   certain 
amendments and additions and ultimately recommended that the draft Legislative Guide, as revised, 
be submitted to the UNIDROIT Governing Council for review and adoption. 
Following the Committee’s meeting and in accordance with the Committee’s recommendation, the 
draft  Legislative  Guide  was  prepared  and  submitted  to  the UNIDROIT Governing  Council  for 
consideration  and  adoption  at  its  96
th
 session  (Rome,  10-12  May  2017).  At  that  session,  the 
Governing  Council  adopted  the  Legislative  Guide  and  authorised  the  Secretariat  to  promote  its 
dissemination and implementation.

Since its adoption, the Legislative Guide underwent formatting and related work to prepare it for 
publication, both online and in print, in English, French and Chinese during the fall of 2017, with a 
Spanish  version  to  be  ready  in  early  2018.  Immediately following the General Assembly’s 76
th
 
session (Rome, 7 December 2017), there was a panel presentation celebrating and promoting the 
launch of the Legislative Guide.

The Secretariat continued to do its utmost, in 2017, to promote the UNIDROIT Conventions and other 
instruments by presenting them at conferences or by publishing articles focussing on them. 
Annex  II provides  an  overview  of  the  instruments drawn  up by UNIDROIT as  well  as  the  state  of 
implementation  of  Conventions  prepared  by UNIDROIT and  approved  by  diplomatic  Conferences 
convened by UNIDROIT member  States. For  the  implementation  of  instruments  based  on  work 
conducted within UNIDROIT, see Annex III.

UNIDROIT/FAO/IFAD Legal Guide on Contract Farming  
The IFAD/FAO  Project  of  Implementation  of  the  UNIDROIT/FAO/IFAD  Legal  Guide  on  Contract 
Farming implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) under 
a grant delivered by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) came to completion 
at the end of 2017. In its capacity of co-author of the Guide and member of the Advisory Board, 
UNIDROIT provided substantial inputs in the elaboration of outreach materials. 
Also, UNIDROIT participated in the project with the Community of Practice on Legal Aspects of Contract 
Farming  (CoP/LACF). The CoP/LACF, also  linked  with the Global  Forum  on  Law,  Justice  and 
Development  (GFLJD),  was  launched  by UNIDROIT in  2016 with the  main  objective  of  promoting  a 
favourable  legal  environment  for  contract  farming  operations  through  knowledge  sharing  and 
dissemination, as well as projects pursued individually by the partners and members or the basis of 
joint initiatives. The CoP’s website (http://www.unidroit.org/community-of-practice/home) serves as 
a repository of information, and particularly worth of mention is the Legal Resources Webpage which 
offers a wealth of references on legal bibliography, regulations and good practices regarding contract 
farming and agricultural contracts.

UNESCO-UNIDROIT Model  Provisions  on  State  Ownership  of  Undiscovered 
Cultural Objects 
Status  
On 31 December 2017, there were 41 Contracting States of the UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or 
Illegally Exported Cultural Objects (cf. Annex II). Tunisia (on 2 March), Bosnia and Herzegovina (on 
8 May), Lao People’s Democratic Republic (on 18 May) and Botswana (on 28 August) acceded to the 
Convention. Other instruments of ratification/accession are to be deposited with the Depositary and 
procedures are in progress in other countries. 
Informal Ratification Task Force  
A special  event  on “Promoting  and  Strengthening  the  International  Legal Framework  for  The 
Protection of Cultural Heritage – The 1995 Convention” took place at UN Headquarters in New York, 
on 28 February 2017. The Secretary General of UNIDROIT and the Senior Legal Officer in charge of 
the International Protection of Cultural Objects at UNIDROIT attended the meeting.  
Considering  the  fundamental  role  played  by  international  conventions  in  the  fight  against  illicit 
trafficking of cultural property, during the event, UNIDROIT and the Missions of Cyprus and Italy to 
the UN announced the establishment of an informal Ratification Task Force to enhance participation 
in the Convention and other related instruments.  
The 1995 UNIDROIT Convention Academic Project 
On  November  2017, UNIDROIT officially  launched  the  1995 UNIDROIT Convention  Academic  Project 
(“UCAP”). 
7
 UCAP  takes  the  form  of  an  online  platform  of  shared  materials  related  to  the  1995 
UNIDROIT Convention, UNIDROIT/UNESCO  Model  Provisions  on  State  Ownership  of  Undiscovered 
Cultural  Objects  and  related  international  instruments. UCAP  is  designed  primarily  to  raise 
awareness on UNIDROIT’s instruments aiming at protecting cultural heritage from illicit conduct. 
UCAP addresses universities and professors holding classes in the field of cultural heritage law or 
art  law,  which  will  be  encouraged  to  set  up  courses  in  partnership  with UNIDROIT to  create  an 
academic  network. UCAP  also  aims  at  involving, inter  alia, practicing  lawyers,  judges,  other 
governments’ officials,  as  well  as  art  market  players so  as  to  assess  the  implementation  of  the 
Convention at national level and the influence of the UNIDROIT Convention in States not yet party to 
the Convention.  
UNIDROIT and the G7 on Culture  
On 30-31 March 2017, UNIDROIT was invited to attend the first G7 Culture meeting of the history of 
G7, held  in  Florence,  under  the  Italian  Presidency,  as  a speaker  at  the  Meeting  of  Experts  and 
observer  at  the  Ministerial  Session.  The  event,  that  ended  with  the  signature  of  the  Florence 
Declaration,
8
 gave a large-scale visibility to the current and past work carried out by UNIDROIT and 
its partners. 
On 3 October 2017, UNIDROIT was invited to participate in the G7 Rome-Lyon Group ad hoc expert 
meeting organised by the Italian Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage (TPC) 
in Rome.

property through criminal law”, organised in  Lucca  (3-4  February  2017) by  the  IMT  School  for 
Advanced Studies.  
UNIDROIT was  also  invited  to  participate  in  various  capacity-building  workshops  or  other  expert 
meetings organised by its partners in 2017 among which: 
- 4
th
 EU CULTNET Meeting: “Law Enforcement Authorities and Expertise Competent in the Field

UNESCO and the Italian Carabinieri (Amman, Jordan, 17-20 December 2017). 
UNIDROIT contributed to a course of the Geneva Summer School of International Cultural Heritage 
Law – University of Geneva, on 14 June 2017. The module taught by Ms Marina Schneider, UNIDROIT 
Senior  Legal  Officer  and  Treaty  Depositary,  focused  on the  weaknesses  of  the  1970  UNESCO 
Convention,  the  1995 UNIDROIT Convention  and  UNESCO-UNIDROIT Model  Provisions  on  State 
Ownership of Undiscovered Cultural Objects. 
b. Private art collections  
Taking into  consideration  the  fact this  subject  is  on  the  Work  Programme  2017-2019  with  a  low 
priority, UNIDROIT is continuing to consider the project to identify the private law aspects that fall 
within  its  mandate. UNIDROIT therefore  proposed  to  host  in  Rome,  on  16  and  17  March  2017,  a 
conference  on Private  Collections:  Historical  and  Legal  Perspectives and  invited Professor  Elina 

Legislative activities 
 25 
Moustaira,  professor  of  comparative  law  at  the  School  of  Law  of  the  National  and  Kapodistrian 
University of Athens,
9
 to make a presentation.  
The Conference was co-organised with the International Society of Research and Cultural Heritage 
Law (ISCHAL), the Institut des sciences sociales du politique (CNRS-ENS Cachan-Université Paris-
Nanterre)  and  BonelliErede  law  firm.
10
 At  the  end  of  the Conference, UNIDROIT asked  Professor 
Moustaira  to  prepare a  document  indicating  private  law  aspects  on  which UNIDROIT’s particular 
expertise would be of additional benefit in this field. 
To  date, UNIDROIT is evaluating the topic’s potential and moving towards new collaborations for 
future studies. The Institute conducted preliminary exchanges with the IBA Art, Cultural Institutions 
and Heritage Law Committee during the IBA Annual Conference in Sydney, Australia (8 to 13 October 
2017) which showed interest in the topic and willingness to co-operate.  
5. Capital markets instruments 
UNIDROIT’s work in the area of capital markets has resulted in three instruments for all of which the 
Secretariat is ready to assist implementing States.  
Geneva Securities Convention 
The  Convention,  which  was  adopted  at  the  final  session  of  the  diplomatic  Conference  to  adopt  a 
Convention on Substantive Rules regarding Intermediated Securities (Geneva, 5-9 October 2009), 
seeks  to  enhance  the  internal  stability  of  domestic  financial  markets  and  their  cross-border 
compatibility, and currently has one Signatory State, Bangladesh.  
Principles on the Operation of Close-out Netting Provisions 
The Netting Principles were adopted by the UNIDROIT Governing Council at its 92
nd
 session (Rome, 
8-10 May 2013) and provide detailed guidance to national legislators of implementing States seeking 
to revise or introduce legislation relevant to the functioning of close-out netting.  
Legislative Guide on Intermediated Securities 
The Legislative  Guide aims  to  enhance  legal  certainty  in  capital  markets  and  is  intended  to 
complement and promote (a) the Geneva Securities Convention by summarising the Convention’s 
key principles and rules and by offering guidance on choices to be made and matters to be addressed 
or clarified in establishing an intermediated securities holding system or evaluating an existing one; 
and (b) the Netting Principles by offering guidance consistent with those Principles and incorporating 
references to them. The Legislative Guide was launched at a panel presentation held in connection 
with the General Assembly’s 76
th
 session (7 December 2017) and, as of this writing, is available in 
English, French and Chinese, with a Spanish version to be made available in early 2018.

  Professor Moustaira is the author or a book which had been the source of inspiration of the proposal to 
insert the subject of private art collections in the UNIDROIT Work Programme. Art Collections, Private and Public: 
A comparative Legal Study. Springer. Cham Heidelberg New York Dordrecht London. 2015.

  The Conference was sponsored by the Università degli Studi di Milano, the Art-Law Centre of Geneva, 
the Institut d’études de droit public (IEDP) and the Institut Droit Ethique Patrimoine (IDEP)  of  the  Université 
Paris-Saclay.

The broad aim of the legal co-operation programme is to promote relations between UNIDROIT and 
member and non-member States with a view to achieving the statutory aims of the Organisation. 
The Programme is designed above all for countries lacking sufficient resources to participate in the 
legal harmonisation process, in particular developing countries and countries in economic transition, 
and  essentially  focuses  on  the  efforts  undertaken  to  implement  and  disseminate  the  work  of  the 
Institute,  and  provides  training  and  research  opportunities  for  high-level  jurists,  by  means  of  a 
Scholarships Programme. For the Organisation’s institutional relations with Governments (visits and 
seminars in member and non-member countries), see supra p. 7. 
1. Co-operation with partner organisations 
The UNIDROIT Secretariat  maintains  close  institutional  co-operation  links  with  a  broad  range  of 
organisations with a universal or regional mandate. This includes the exchange of information and 
consultations  with  respect  to  topics  of  common  interest,  in  particular  in  the  framework  of  the 
Institute’s legislative activities (see supra). 
2. Research Scholarships Programme 
Since  it  was  first  launched  in  1993,  the  Programme  has  enabled  the  Institute  to  host over  350 
researchers from more than 60 countries with a view to their conducting in-depth research on their 
chosen subject, provided it is in line with UNIDROIT’s activities or at any rate involves uniform law, 
in the Institute Library for an average of two months. 
In 2017, donations were received from the Transnational Law and Business University (TLBU), the 
UNIDROIT Foundation, the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China (MOFCOM), as well 
as from members of the UNIDROIT Governing Council.

UNIDROIT on Social media  
UNIDROIT entered into the social media world in 2016 by the opening of accounts on Facebook and 
LinkedIn.  The  purpose  of  the  Institute’s  social  media  program  is  to  promote  the  work  being 
undertaken by the Institute to a wider audience in a fast, efficient and cost effective manner.

Library cooperation and networking 
In  2017 the UNIDROIT Library  continued  its  cooperation  strategy  with  other  Roman  and  foreign 
libraries. 
Library management software upgrading 
The  Library’s software management system Aleph500 was upgraded to the latest version Aleph 
21.3.4 without any interruption of services for the Institute’s professional staff or the researchers in 
the Library.  
Cataloguing 
With regard to cataloguing, work continued with regard to the development of a so called “Legal 
thesaurus”, which allows an even more precise search result in all languages. The project is very 
innovative, as just a few other libraries in the world operate a legal thesaurus in various languages.  
Digitisation  
On the occasion of the Governing Council’s 96
th
 session, Rome, 10 - 12 May 2017, it was agreed to 
proceed with the proposed in-house digitisation project, as an attractive opportunity to make the 
collection of a large library, such as the UNIDROIT Library, accessible in digital form.  
In 2017 the Library continued, therefore, on the implementation of an in-house digitisation project. 
About 500 monographs and articles were scanned in-house by the Library staff. The software module 

Legal co-operation programme and non-legislative activities 
 29 
ADAM for the implementation of the digitised objects into the online catalogue, distributed by the 
firm Ex Libris, was acquired in November 2017. It has been integrated into the ALEPH 500 library 
management system. Thanks to the ADAM library management software module, it is now possible 
to easily connect a large quantity of electronic documents to the catalogue data. 
The professional book scanner “ALPHA PLANETARIO”, was ordered in December 2017, and will be 
delivered in February 2018.  
Thanks to the greatly improved technical resources, the full entry into the partial digitisation of the 
UNIDROIT library collection has been secured. A great quantity of library material can now be added 
to the electronic collection. It will be made available for readers after quality control by library staff 
and the firm SIAI (Servizi Integrali alle Imprese), the experts in the field of the digitisation of books. 
Acquisitions, donations, exchanges 
In 2017, the Library’s holdings increased by 1118 titles, of which 642 were purchased outright, 147 
were obtained on an exchange basis, while 329 further titles were received as gifts for a total value 
of € 12.870,00. The expansion of the Library’s holdings has been hampered by steady increases in 
the price of publications and a chronic lack of resources.  
In 2017, as in previous years, the Library received donations in kind from the Max-Planck-Institute 
of   Foreign   Private   and   Private   International   Law   in   Hamburg,   and   from   the   Deutsche 
Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).  
Visitors 
The Library continues to attract readers from all over the world. Among the 1054 visitors in 2017, 
the 63 foreign guests came from 39 different countries.

Booklets with UNIDROIT Instruments 
The  Secretariat  has  adopted  the  policy  of  printing  booklets  containing  the  text  of UNIDROIT 
instruments  that  are  not  for  sale  but  for  use  at  conferences  and  other  events. In  2017,  the 
Secretariat published the booklet with the French version of the Aircraft Protocol after completion of

2017 was a watershed year for the UNIDROIT Foundation in a number of respects.  
Following an internal change in the management of the Foundation, a review of its operation and 
performance  was  undertaken.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  review,  the  Foundation  prepared  a 
Strategic  Plan  for  consideration  by  the  Board  of  Governors.  The  Strategic  Plan  set  out  clear 
objectives  for  the  Foundation  in  relation  to  its  core  activity  of  promoting UNIDROIT through  (i) 
fundraising for the Institute and (ii) the undertaking of complementary projects that assist in the 
implementation  of UNIDROIT Instruments.  The  Strategic  Plan  was  approved  by  the  Board  of 
Governors on 29 May 2017.  
Significant progress was made on the Foundation’s active projects. Two workshops on the economic 
assessment of international commercial law reform were held at the Harris Manchester College in 
Oxford in March and September 2017. At these workshops, the framework for undertaking economic 
assessments  was  substantially  refined  and  tested  in  relation  to  the  preparation  of an  economic 
impact analysis for the future fourth Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile 
Equipment in matters specific to Mining, Agriculture and Construction Equipment. Towards the end 
of 2017 the University of Washington joined Harris Manchester College and the Foundation as official 
partners on the project.  
Initial steps were also made in the Foundation’s support of UNIDROIT’s work in the field of protection 
of cultural objects. The Foundation provided funding and technical expertise in establishing the 1995 
UNIDROIT Convention Academic Project website (https://1995unidroitcap.org/).  
A further workshop was also held on the Best Practices in the Field of Electronic Registry Design and 
Operation from 27–28 March 2017 at Harris Manchester College.  
As part of its Strategic Plan, the Foundation also developed a new Fundraising Strategy, with grateful 
pro  bono  assistance  from  Mr  Michael  Farley  of  EMD  Consulting  Group.  The  Fundraising  Strategy 
established a more active role for the Foundation is attempting to raise funds to support the work 
of UNIDROIT. In implementing the new Strategy, the Foundation wrote to over 50 targeted entities 
in the second half of 2017 to request support for the Foundation’s work.  
To  enhance  the  profile  of  the  Foundation,  a  comprehensive  redesign  of  the UNIDROIT Foundation 
website  was  undertaken  (http://unidroitfoundation.org/).  The  Foundation  also  established  social 
media accounts on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.  
To support the new strategic direction of the Foundation, the Board of Governors met twice in 2017. 
On  9  May  2017  the  Board  of  Governors  held  its  traditional  meeting  in  Rome  in  advance  of  the 
UNIDROIT Governing Council meeting. At this meeting, the Foundation’s administrative matters were 
attended to (the review of the Foundation’s work in 2016, the approval of the previous year’s 
accounts and approval of the 2017 budget). On 29 May 2017, the Board of Governor’s held its first 
successful  meeting  via  videoconference. At this meeting, the Board of Governor’s discussed and 
renewed the Foundation’s active projects and approved the Strategic Plan.   
To assist in the execution of this substantial workload, the Foundation recruited a legal assistant (Mr 
Hamza Hameed) who worked with the Foundation from March – September 2017.
