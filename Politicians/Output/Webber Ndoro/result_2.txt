Best wishes from Webber Ndoro, ICCROM Director-General




Dear ICCROM friends,  

I would like to thank all of you for the outstanding support I received during my six-year term as Director-General. Some moments have proved challenging but always very stimulating, and through the continuous and valuable support of our Member States and partners, the Organization has successfully achieved many goals for the protection and preservation of cultural heritage.  

ICCROM would not be the same without its community. We accomplish much more together than we ever could apart. In 2023, we successfully wrapped up some of our key projects while embarking on new initiatives; we renewed milestone joint commitments with our Member States and forged new partnerships. As we continue to grow, we are also strengthening ICCROM for the future.

In this season of change following the election held during the 33rd session of the General Assembly, Ms Aruna Francesca Maria Gujral will begin her term as Director-General of ICCROM from January 2024. I wish her all the best for a journey full of success and satisfaction, and I am confident that the ICCROM community will support her work and that the Organization will flourish under her leadership in the coming years.

Thank you for a year worth remembering. We look forward to all that 2024 holds.

Happy holidays,

Webber Ndoro
Director-General
ICCROM
