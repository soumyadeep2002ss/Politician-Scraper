On 17 January 2024, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the accession of the Republic of South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ to ICCROM.

Together with the African World Heritage Fund, the Youth.Heritage.Africa (YHA) programme has made remarkable progress in helping young heritage leaders transform Africa's heritage into a catalyst for economic and social opportunities.
Â 
Last year, our latest engagement with Iziko Museums played a pivotal role in implementing the South African #HeritageHub. ICCROM's joint efforts with South Africa have also fostered the emergence of a strong network of professionals dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the country's cultural legacy, as done in 2023 to safeguard the World Heritage site of Robben Island.Â

On 17 January, the DG of ICCROM, Aruna Gujral, had the honour of receiving H.E. Carlos Garcia de Alba, Ambassador of Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ to Italy. Accompanied by Official Mauricio Guerrero, Deputy Head of Mission in charge of multilateral relations, the meeting provided an opportunity to revisit the longstanding partnership established in 1961. Delving into historical graphic materials from ICCROM's archives, the discussions highlighted the pivotal role of Mexico in promoting professionals in heritage conservation.

Together, we shared a vision for the upcoming years, emphasizing our collective commitment to heritage conservation and protection as drivers of well-being, progress and sustainable development.

On 16 January 2024, the Director-General of ICCROM, Aruna Francesca Maria Gujral, received a courtesy visit from H.E. Mirta Granda Averhoff, Ambassador of Cuba to Italy.

The meeting focused on discussing potential heritage conservation initiatives for both tangible and intangible heritage in Cuba and in the broader Latin America and Caribbean region. These include reducing risks to cultural heritage, especially in rapidly urbanizing cities in the region due to higher frequency and intensity of disasters that are exacerbated by climate change.
The meeting also included sharing images and videos from ICCROM archives about the courses held in Cuba since the 1980s, along with archival documents related to Cuba's accession to the Organization. These historical references served to highlight the longstanding collaboration between ICCROM and Cuba in the field of heritage preservation.

We thank the Ambassador for visiting and look forward to continuing our broad efforts to preserve and promote heritage in LAC.

Explore the rich history of the Great Mosque of Kairouan with ICCROM's January #ResourceOfTheMonth! This photograph shows the mihrab of the Great Mosque in Kairouan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1988, made of curved wood and thick plaster and adorned with plant motifs, demonstrating the essence of Islamic art and architecture.Â 
Captured in 1973 by Franco Rigamonti, this image is part of a series documenting the restoration work on the mihrab in the 1970s. 

Since 1962, ICCROM has carried out technical and advisory missions to Tunisia to train specialized staff and advise on conserving monuments, museums, historic city centres and archaeological sites. 

The Great Mosque of Kairouan received special attention from ICCROM, with consultations on mural paintings, the mihrab, and even the restoration of a wooden sarcophagus dating back to the Punic period. 

The journey didn't stop there â€“ ICCROM also assessed the Sfax Great Mosque and contributed to architectural and urban studies for the protection and enhancement of historic towns like Sfax and Testour. 

Delve into the fascinating history and conservation efforts through correspondence, reports, photographs, architectural drawings, and heritage samples available in the ICCROM Archives.

Happy National Youth Day! Today, we shine a light on the work one of our Net Zero groups is doing to engage youth in India. GRRID Corps nurtures young minds to become not only risk-aware but risk-savvy. They put into action their belief that equipping youth with the right tools is essential to navigate the complexities of tomorrow. 

ICCROM's flagship programme FAR, in partnership with the Swedish Postcode Foundation, supports GRRID Corps' journey in Jodhpur to provide knowledge and empowerment using a blend of science and tradition. In partnership with the Living Waters Museum, the East India Dastangos and the Mehrangarh Museum Trust, GRIDD Corps has provided young people with a scientific understanding of risks, empowering them to face challenges head-on while acknowledging the invaluable insights of traditional knowledge for resilience and adaptation that have stood the test of time.

TheÂ ICCROM-IUCN World Heritage LeadershipÂ (WHL) programme, the Unit for the Caribbean and Latin America of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, and the Regional World Heritage Institute in Zacatecas (IRPMZ) have come together to support World Heritage in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). 

In the second half of 2023, a 3-day course on applying the newÂ Enhancing Our Heritage Toolkit 2.0Â (EOH 2.0) was organized for World Heritage site managers. Between October and November 2023, three World Heritage properties in the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Peru received support in conducting a management effectiveness assessment for their sites.Â 

The course gave participants an overview of the importance of assessing the effectiveness of management efforts to understand what is working and what needs improvement using the EOH 2.0 methodology to conduct a full assessment of their sites' management systems. The course explained the uses of EOH 2.0 and how it should be applied and provided a thorough explanation of how to carry out the entire assessment process, including an explanation of how to use all the toolkit's worksheets

Today, we warmly welcomed our first visitors in the new year! It was our pleasure to receive ICCROM Council Member Ola Wetterberg and a group of his Objects and Built Heritage Conservation students from the University of Gothenburg.

The group heard about ICCROM's work and opportunities for young conservation professionals to make their start here through our internship programme. The students then received a tour of the ICCROM Library and Archives.

We at ICCROM recognize the importance of shaping the next generation of conservation professionals, which is why we invite all students and young professionals to apply for our internship programme.

Applications for 2025 internships open soon!
