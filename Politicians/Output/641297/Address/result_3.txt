Report from the Chair of the Affiliate

(AMCC)

Development, National Futures Association
Value of AMCC’s breadth, depth and 
diversity
IOSCO’s   2019   Risk   Outlook   was   redesigned   to 
be   more   outcomes-focused   and   to   strengthen   the 
interaction  between  the  research  function,  the  Board 
and  its  committees,  including  the  Affiliate  Members 
Consultative  Committee  (AMCC).    For  the  first  time, 
IOSCO  supplemented  its  top-down  approach  for  the 
2019 Risk Outlook with a bottom-up view of key risks by 
drawing extensively on the expertise of policy committees, 
the  Growth  and  Emerging  Markets  Committee  and  the 
AMCC.  Given that  the Risk Outlook Report establishes 
the foundation for IOSCO’s work program, a top priority 
of the AMCC is to contribute in a meaningful way to the 
Risk Outlook development process.      
The  breadth,  depth  and  diversity  of  the  AMCC’s  over 
65  affiliate  members  provide  a  wide-angle  lens  that 
captures  a  range  of  potential  risks  that  could  impact 
the financial markets. AMCC members represent self-
regulatory  organizations  (SROs),  exchanges,  market 
infrastructures,  investor  protection  and  compensation 
funds, associations of regulated entities as well as other 
bodies  with  an  interest  in  securities  and  derivatives 
regulation.  The AMCC’s valuable front-line regulatory 
expertise and market insights are critical inputs to the 
development of the annual Risk Outlook, allowing the 
AMCC  to  make  significant  contributions  to  IOSCO’s 
priorities and ongoing policy and standard-setting work. 
AMCC Receives Important Assignment 
Regarding Market Fragmentation
The  AMCC  made  a  significant  contribution  this  year 
that  is  detailed  in  IOSCO’s  June  2019  report  titled 
Market  Fragmentation  and  Cross-border  Regulations. 
This  report  focuses  on  market  fragmentation  that 
arises  as  an  unintended  and  harmful  consequence  of 
financial  regulation.    The  report  acknowledges  that 
IOSCO is unique among international standard-setting 
bodies in having a committee made up largely of market 
participants.    The  report  states  further  that  IOSCO’s 
AMCC should play an increasing and more specific role 
in  identifying  instances  where  market  fragmentation 
occurs. In addition to providing IOSCO with input from 
market  participants,  the  AMCC  was  asked  to  prepare 
an  evidence-based  report  for  the  IOSCO  Board  on 
an  annual  basis  to  ensure  that  the  issue  of  harmful 
fragmentation  remains  a  regular  item  on  the  IOSCO 
agenda.    This  annual  report  should  describe  where 
AMCC  members  have  identified  cases  of  harmful 
fragmentation that have a cross-border element. 
Significant Contributions
Investor  Protection:     In  support  of  this  important 
objective,  approximately  half  of  the  AMCC  member-
ship  participated  in  the  third  annual  IOSCO  World 
Investor  Week  (WIW)  to  promote  investor  education 
and  protection.  Events  ranged  from  webinars,  panel 
The AMCC ́s objectives are aligned with IOSCO ́s objectives to enhance to enhance investor 
protection, maintain fair, efficient and transparent markets and address systemic risk. As 
detailed  further  below,  2019  saw  an  increase  in  the  AMCC’s  contributions  to  IOSCO’s 
Committee  on  Emerging  Risks,  policy  committees  and  workstreams  in  furtherance  of 
IOSCO’s priorities and objectives.

discussions,  social  media  campaigns,  participating 
in the opening ceremonies and ring the bell events. 
Specifically,  the  World  Federation  of  Exchanges, 
an AMCC Member, partnered with IOSCO to launch 
the inaugural Ring the Bell for Financial Literacy as 
part of the WIW 2019 event.  Close to forty exchan-
ges  and  CCPs,  15  of  which  were  AMCC  members, 
participated in this important event.  This initiative 
is  an  excellent  example  of  exchanges  and  market 
infrastructures  working  together  with  regulators  to 
promote financial literacy.  
Emerging   Risks: AMCC   members   increased   their 
contributions this year to the development of IOSCO’s 
2020 Annual Risk Outlook.  AMCC members provided 
input on emerging regulatory issues, risks, trends and 
vulnerabilities.  AMCC members also submitted issue 
notes covering topics including benchmarks, CCP risk 
management,  best  practices,  recovery  and  resolution, 
initial  margin  for  non-centrally  cleared  swaps  phase 
V,  market  fragmentation,  cyber-resilience  and  repo 
market risks and vulnerabilities. 
Sustainable  Finance: Understanding  how  sustain-
ability  issues  relate  to  our  financial  markets  is  an 
important   topic   for   many   AMCC   members   and, 
therefore, a focus of AMCC activities.  In addition to 
including  this  topic  on  the  AMCC’s  meeting  agenda, 
AMCC Vice Chair Nandini Sukumar delivered remarks 
at  IOSCO’s  Sustainable  Finance  Network’s  (SFN) 
stakeholders  meeting,  and  many  AMCC  members 
provided their industry insights to SFN.
