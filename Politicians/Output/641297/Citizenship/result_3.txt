This structure has given rise to an assertive discussion of topics. The possibility for members to participate not only in the AMCC in general, but also to engage in specific issues provided engagement and enriched discussions, which proved to be more productive than centralizing all matters in the chair.

 

 

Portal ANBIMA: Why not apply for re-election?

Zeca: The command of such an entity should not be eternal -- it's time to make room for another leadership that brings a new look in order to improve processes and activities. For ANBIMA, for the team that was with me and for me, it was an enriching and incredible exchange of experiences and learning. We took our banner around the world as an association and self-regulatory entity. We left our mark on AMCC and fulfilled a mission in those six years: Contributing to ANBIMA’s internationalization and helping the regulatory community. We remain as active members of the committee, but we will strive to seek greater representation in other international forums of which we participate.
