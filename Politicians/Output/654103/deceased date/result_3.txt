About us

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an independent intergovernmental organisation supported by 34 states based in Reading.

ECMWF is both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing and disseminating numerical weather predictions to its Member States.

ECMWF specialises in global numerical weather prediction for up to about 2 weeks ahead (the medium range). We also produce longer-range forecasts for up to a year ahead, with varying degrees of detail. We use advanced computer modelling techniques to analyse observations and predict future weather using our supercomputer facility which is one of the largest of its type in Europe.

We would like to support the DTP by providing co-supervision, access to facilities and data.
