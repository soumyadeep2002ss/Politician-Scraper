According%20to 2017 data, the Court was composed by 79 magistrates.[8]

Nomination and appointment[edit]

The Constitution does not regulate the form of appointment of the magistrates although it does regulate the procedure of appointment of the President of the Court. According to Section 123, the President is nominated by the General Council of the Judiciary and appointed by the Monarch. The Judiciary Organic Act of 1985 copy this procedure of appointment but specifies that the Royal Decree must be countersigned by the Minister of Justice.

To be a candidate for Magistrate of the Supreme Court the law establishes two options:

Justices from the category of Magistrate, with at least ten years in the category of Magistrate and fifteen in the judicial career.
Legal experts of recognized prestige and with fifteen years of a legal career.
Military members of the Fifth Chamber[edit]

The Organic Law on the military jurisdiction provides that half of the members of the Fifth chamber will be selected from general officers of the Military Legal Corps. These members are appointed by the General council of the judiciary from a list proposed by the Ministry of Defence. Upon nomination to the Supreme Court, military members are retired from the armed forces and will act only on the capacity of Supreme Court Justices.[9]

Tenure[edit]

The tenure of the Magistrates of the Supreme Court is regulated in Section 386 of the Judiciary Organic Act and it establishes a life tenure. However, the law also established that the magistrates must retire at the age of 70. However, the law allows the magistrates to ask the General Council of the Judiciary an extension of their tenure until the age of 72. The Magistrates can freely retire since the age of 65.

Outside of these cases, magistrates shall be forcedly retired when there is a permanent disability for the exercise of their functions. The forced retire can be requested by the Prosecution Ministry or the magistrate itself to the Governing Council of the Supreme Court or to the Governing Council of a specific chamber. After this, the Governing Council shall send the request to the GCJ and the Council shall approve the retire.
