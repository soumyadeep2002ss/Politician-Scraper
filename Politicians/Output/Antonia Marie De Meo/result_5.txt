Vice Minister Emanuela Del Re received Antonia Marie De Meo at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since 1st July Ms De Meo is the Director of the United Nations Interregional Institute for Research on Crime and Justice (UNICRI), with offices in Turin. The meeting was the occasion for a presentation of the strategic vision and priorities that the new Director intends to develop. She thanked Italy for the support she has always given to the Institute’s activities.

“Over the years, UNICRI’s work has been – and still is – significant in promoting fair and efficient criminal justice systems at a national level, in supporting the respect of international law and in facilitating executive cooperation and judicial assistance” – said the Vice Minister to the interlocutor.

“We are count on UNICRI to continue to help partner countries to combat extremism, organized crime, illegal trafficking and illicit financial flows, to strengthen the rule of law in post-conflict countries, to empower vulnerable groups, especially in these difficult times due to the COVID19 pandemic. – she continued.

“In a broader perspective, we believe that UNICRI is an important resource for achieving equitable and sustainable development. It is particularly true for the achievement of objective 16 of the Agenda 2030, to mitigate the impact of the crisis on judicial systems, and to ensure a just, equitable and sustainable recovery”.

In conclusion, Del Re expressed the conviction that the new Director will be able to lead the Institute efficiently and enthusiastically. She assured Director De Meo that she could count on the incessant support of Italy.
