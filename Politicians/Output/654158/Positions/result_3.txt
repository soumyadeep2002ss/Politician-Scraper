‘JO-ANNE  DUGGAN  creates  gorgeous  large-scale,  colour  beautiful 
photographs and arresting in themselves and an intelligent commen-
tary on the nature of our engagement with historic visual and material 
culture, which often highlights the unexpected and the barely noticed. 
Her  photographic  approach  is  very  sensitive  to  the  complex  history 
and meanings of the objects and interiors at which she gazes, very 
respectful of them, too, while remaining determinedly Australian and 
post-colonial in their presence.’
