The Zoram People's Movement (abbreviated: ZPM) is an alliance of six regional parties formed under the leadership of MLA and former IPS Officer Lalduhoma.[7] The party believes in secularism and the protection of religious minorities in India.[8] In the 2023 Mizoram Assembly polls, the party won 27 seats out of 40 seats and Lalduhoma became the Chief Minister of Mizoram.[9]

In the 2018 Mizoram Legislative Assembly election, Zoram People's Movement emerged. It supported some independent candidates with the same symbol, flag, and policy, and won 8 seats.[10] Zoram People's Movement was reformed as a political party from a movement group. Mizoram People's Conference left the alliance in 2019[11] due to ZPM becoming a political party.

In 2020, some members of the ZNP left the alliance due to the election of their party, along with issues of assigning a new party leader and reforming Zoram Nationalist Party (ZNP).

In 2023, the party won all 11 wards in the newly formed Lunglei Municipal Council.[10]
