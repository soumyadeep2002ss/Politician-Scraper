This poster for the Men√©ndez International University
Pelayo tries to represent, very schematically,
the spirit, art and knowledge of all kinds that
nourish.
 
I symbolize this on a ladder, on whose steps
They settle the music at the top, continue in these
descending steps, the figures that represent
Sciences, literature, theater and their masks.
 
Cutting in the blue of the sea the paint is defined,
expressing the power of the look, an aid to
Understand the world, contingent reality.
 
The composition ends with a plane, a symbol to
Perform for young people, always present and future of
know.
