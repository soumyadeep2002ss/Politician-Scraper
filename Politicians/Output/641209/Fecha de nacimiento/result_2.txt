João Andrade Nunes

Summary: Trying for charging the Brazilian political and social agitation that pronounced the independence of Brazil, D. João VI, on December 19, 1821, determined that it leaves a naval force from Lisbon to, among other instructions, to conduct Brigadeiro José to Pernambuco even Pernambuco Correa de Mello and transport a contingent of land forces capable of helping the Portuguese auxiliary division that was in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Trusted to Squadron Chief Francisco Maximiliano de Sousa, this mission was such that, arrived in Lisbon, the aforementioned general official was promptly submitted to Castrense court. Embraced from procedural inconsistencies, Maximiliano de Sousa, after twice convicted and twice acquitted, came to find his forgiveness in a peculiar royal decree. Abstract: In the Attempt to Put an End To the Political and Social Brazilian Disorders That Pronounce Brazil's Independence, King John, The Sixth, On December 19, 1821, Orded a Naval Force to Leave Lisbon, Among other Instructions, To Transport Brigadier José Correa de Mello to Pernambuco and a contingent of lead forces to assist the Portuguese auxiliary division in Rio de Janeiro. The Mission, Assigned to the General Officer Francisco Maximiliano de Sousa, was so atypical that, Upon Arriving in Lisbon, The Above-Marked General Officer Was Promptly Subjected to the Military Justice.
