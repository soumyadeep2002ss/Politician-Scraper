On massive neutrino haloes and galactic structure
Article
A. Crollalanza
Remo Ruffini
J. G. Gao
The interaction of massive neutrino haloes and 'visible matter' (plasma, atoms and molecules) in a galactic structure is investigated on the basis of a series of simplified numerical models. Idealized distributions are obtained for the density of visible matter and the density distributions of the neutrino haloes, taking into account the effects of...

Gravitoelectromagnetism and Motion of Spinning Test Particles in General Relativity
Article
D. Bini
G. Gemelli
Remo Ruffini
The motion of a spinning test particle in general relativity is examined in the context of gravitoelectromagnetism. The equations of motion as measured by different families of test observers and the supplementary conditions to be added to obtain a fully determined scheme are expressed in terms of the associated gravitoelectric, gravitomagnetic, an...

On the Non-Riemannian Manifolds as Framework for Geometric Unification Theories: Affine Connection Geometry with Asymmetric Metric
Article
Sabrina Casanova
Giovanni Montani
Remo Ruffini
Roustam Zalaletdinov
Application of non-Riemannian geometries with an asymmetric metric tensor to the problem of geometric unification is discussed. An approach to a classification for such kind of geometries in the spirit of Schouten is proposed.
