Iván Fernández Anaya (born 10 June 1988) is a Spanish athlete who competes for Spain internationally.

He competes in long-distance running events, mostly cross country and marathon and has been coached by Martín Fiz,[2] and Santi Pérez.[3] A video of Fernández shoving a lost Abel Mutai towards the finish line during the Burlada Cross Country race, rather than passing Mutai and winning the race, went viral in January 2013. He was globally praised for his sportsmanship.[4][5][6]
