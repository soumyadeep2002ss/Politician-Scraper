He was the younger son of Pedro Fernández de Córdoba, Count of Aguilar (Himself the Son of Pedro Fernández de Córdoba, 1390–1424 and of Leonor de Arellano) and of Elvira de Herrera (Daughter of Pedro yúñez de Herrera y. 1430, and Blanca Enríquez de Mendoza). In 1455, when Gonzalo was two years old, his father died. his Older Brother, Alonso, Inherited All of Their Father's Estates, Leaving Gonzalo to Seek His Fortune. in 1467, Gonzalo was first attached to the household of Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, The Half-Brother of King Henry IV of Castile. After Alfonso Died in 1468, Gonzalo Devoted HIMSELF to Alfonso's Sister, Isabella of Castile.[1

when King Henry IV Died in 1474, Isabella Proclaimed Hersef of Successor as Queen, Disputing the Right of Juana La Beltraneja (The King's 13-year-old Daughter and Her niece) to ascend the throne. During the ensuing civil war between the followers of Isabella and Juana, there was also conflict with portugal since King King Alfonso v of Portugal sided with his niece Juana. Gonzalo FOUGHT for Isabella under Alonso de Cárdenas, Grand Master of the Order of Santiago. In 1479, he FOUGHT in the final again the portuguese by leading 120 lancers. Cárdenas Praised him for His service. when the war ended, Isabella and her Husband Ferdinand were the Rulers of Castile and Aragon.

Conquest of Granada[edits]

Once the Catholic Monarchs Had consolidated their rule, they are embarked in 1481 on a ten-year campaign to conquer grenadada, the last remaining Muslim strong stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula. Fernández de Córdoba was an active participant in the fighting and distinguished himself as a brave and competent military leader. He gained renown for participation in the sieges of several walled towns including Loja, Tajara, Illora, and Montefrío. At Montefrío he was reported to be the first attacker over the walls. In 1492, Fernández de Córdoba captured the city of Granada, bringing an end to the war. The skills of a military engineer and a guerilla fighter were equally useful. Because of his knowledge of Arabic and his familiarity with Boabdil, Gonzalo was chosen as one of the officers to arrange the surrender.[1][2][3]

For his service he was rewarded with an Order of Santiago, an encomienda, the manor of Órgiva in Granada as well as silk production rights in the region.[citation needed]

Italian campaigns[edit]

Gonzalo was an important military commander during the Italian Wars, holding command twice and earning the name "The Great Captain".

First Italian War[edit]
Italy in 1494, when Frederick IV of Naples took power as the second inheriting son of Ferdinand I of Naples

The Italian Wars began in 1494 when Charles VIII of France marched into Italy with 25,000 men to make good his claim to the Kingdom of Naples ruled by Ferdinand II, a cousin to Ferdinand of Aragon. The French easily overwhelmed the Neapolitan defenses and on 12 May 1495 Charles had himself crowned Emperor of Naples. The Catholic Monarchs were anxious to reverse French success in Naples and selected Fernández de Córdoba to lead an expeditionary force against Charles. Fernández de Córdoba landed in Naples shortly after Charles' coronation with a force of about 5,000 infantry and 600 light cavalry. Fearful of being trapped in Italy, Charles installed Gilbert de Bourbon as Viceroy of Naples and returned to France with about half of the French forces.[2][4]

Initially, the light infantry and cavalry under Fernández de Córdoba command were no match against the heavily-armed French. A lack of training and poor coordination between Spanish and Italian forces compounded the problem. In their first major engagement on 28 June 1495, Fernández de Córdoba was defeated at the Battle of Seminara against French forces led by Bernard Stewart d'Aubigny.[5][6] After the defeat, Fernández de Córdoba withdrew to implement a rigorous training program and reorganize his army. The Spanish employed effective guerrilla tactics, striking quickly to disrupt French supply lines and avoiding large-scale battles. Gradually Fernández de Córdoba regained a foothold in the country and then assaulted the French-occupied Italian cities. Within a year, Fernández de Córdoba achieved a decisive victory at Atella, capturing the French viceroy and expelling the remaining French forces from Naples. He also recovered the Roman port of Ostia and returned the captured territories to the Italians by 1498.[3]

Military restructuring[edit]

When Fernández de Córdoba returned to Spain he drew on the lessons from the Italian campaign to restructure the Spanish forces and military strategy. In the open field, the loose formation and short swords of the Spanish infantry were unable to withstand a charge of heavy cavalry and infantry armed with pikes. To overcome this weakness, Fernández de Córdoba introduced a new infantry formation armed with pikes and a heavy, shoulder-fired gun called an arquebus. To increase tactical flexibility he assigned different sections of his forces to specific roles, rather than using them as one general force. These new sections could maneuver more independently and act with greater flexibility.[3]
