About

I am a professional observant linguist possessing a wide range of theoretical and practical knowledge in the morphology of South-Asian (SA) languages and Indian Sign Language. My work mainly includes the morpho-syntactic and typological structure of the numeral systems of SA languages focusing mainly on the tribal/indigenous languages of India and I hope to add more broader perspectives to my research.
