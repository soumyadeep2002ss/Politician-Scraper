Eighty Years' War

The Spanish Armada (a.k.a. the Invincible Armada or the Enterprise of England, Spanish: Grande y Felicísima Armada, lit. 'Great and Most Fortunate Navy') was a Spanish fleet that sailed from Lisbon in late May 1588, commanded by the Alonso de Guzmán, Duke of Medina Sidonia, an aristocrat without previous naval experience appointed by Philip II of Spain. His orders were to sail up the English Channel, join with the Duke of Parma in Flanders, and escort an invasion force that would land in England and overthrow Elizabeth I. Its purpose was to reinstate Catholicism in England, end support for the Dutch Republic, and prevent attacks by English and Dutch privateers against Spanish interests in the Americas.

The Spanish were opposed by an English fleet based in Plymouth. Faster and more manoeuvrable than the larger Spanish galleons, they were able to attack the Armada as it sailed up the Channel. Several subordinates advised Medina Sidonia to anchor in The Solent and occupy the Isle of Wight, but he refused to deviate from his instructions to join with Parma. Although the Armada reached Calais largely intact, while awaiting communication from Parma, it was attacked at night by English fire ships and forced to scatter. The Armada suffered further losses in the ensuing Battle of Gravelines, and was in danger of running aground on the Dutch coast when the wind changed, allowing it to escape into the North Sea. Pursued by the English, the Spanish ships returned home via Scotland and Ireland. Up to 24 ships were wrecked along the way before the rest managed to get home. Among the factors contributing to the defeat and withdrawal of the Armada were bad weather conditions and the better employment of naval guns and battle tactics by the English.

The expedition was the largest engagement of the undeclared Anglo-Spanish War. The following year, England organized a

drift, and was taken off by the current in the opposite direction to the fleet and closer to the English. Drake in the Revenge sailed to the Rosario during the night and she was taken in action; Admiral Pedro de Valdés (commander of the Squadron of Andalusia) surrendered along with his entire crew. On board, the English seized supplies of much-needed gunpowder and 50,000 gold ducats.[50] Drake had been guiding the English fleet by means of a lantern, which he snuffed out to slip away from the Spanish ships, causing the rest of his fleet to become scattered and disarrayed by dawn. At one point, Howard formed his ships into a line of battle to attack at close range, bringing all his guns to bear, but he did not follow through with the manoeuvre and little was achieved. During a lull in battle, San Salvador's gunpowder magazine exploded, lighting a portion of the ship on fire. The Spanish attempted to scuttle the ship, but this failed when the Golden Hind came up. The Spanish evacuated the vessel and the Golden Hind promptly captured her.[51]

If the Armada could create a temporary base in the protected waters of the Solent, the strait separating the Isle of Wight from the English mainland, it could wait there for word from Parma's army; Farnese did not get news of this until 6 August.[52] However, in a full-scale attack, the English fleet broke into four groups with Martin Frobisher of the ship Aid given command over a squadron, and Drake coming with a large force from the south. Medina Sidonia sent reinforcements south and ordered the Armada back to open sea to avoid the Owers shoals.[53] There were no other secure harbours further east along England's south coast, so the Armada was compelled to make for Calais, without being able to wait for word of Parma's army.[citation needed]

Starting on 1 August Sidonia began sending Farnese messages detailing his position and movements. It was not until the following day that Alexander received the first report from the Admiral.[54]

On 7 August, the Armada anchored off Calais in a tightly packed defensive crescent formation,[55] not far from Dunkirk (Farnese only learned of this on that same afternoon)[56] where Parma's army, reduced by disease to 16,000, was expected to be waiting, ready to join the fleet in barges sent from ports along the Flemish coast. An essential element of the plan of invasion, as it was eventually implemented, was the transportation of a large part of Parma's Army of Flanders as the main invasion force in unarmed barges across the English Channel. These barges would be protected by the large ships of the Armada. However, to get to the Armada, they would have to cross the zone dominated by the Dutch navy, where the Armada could not go. This problem seems to have been overlooked by the Armada commanders, but it was insurmountable. Communication was more difficult than anticipated, and word came too late that Parma's army had yet to be equipped with sufficient transport or to be assembled in the port, a process that would take

Elizabeth's Tilbury speech[edit]
Main article: Speech to the Troops at Tilbury

Because of the potential invasion from the Netherlands, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester assembled a force of 4,500 militia at West Tilbury, Essex, to defend the Thames Estuary against any incursion up-river toward London. The result of the English fireship attack and the sea battle of Gravelines had not yet reached England, so Elizabeth went to Tilbury on 18 August to review her forces, arriving on horseback in ceremonial armor to imply to the militia that she was prepared to lead them in the ensuing battle.[74] She gave them her royal address, which survives in at least six slightly different versions.[75] One version is as follows:

Queen Elizabeth I, the Armada Portrait at Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire

My loving people, we have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety, to take heed how we commit ourselves to armed multitudes for fear of treachery; but, I do assure you, I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear, I have always so behaved myself, that under God I have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard in the loyal hearts and goodwill of my subjects; and, therefore, I am come amongst you as you see at this time, not for my recreation and disport, but being resolved, in the midst and heat of battle, to live or die amongst you all – to lay down for my God, and for my kingdoms, and for my people, my honour and my blood even in the dust. I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king – and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which, rather than any dishonour should grow by me, I myself will take up arms – I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field. I know already, for your forwardness, you have deserved rewards and crowns, and, we do assure you, on the word of a prince, they shall be duly paid you. In the mean time, my lieutenant general shall be in my stead, than whom never prince commanded a more noble or worthy subject; not doubting but by your obedience to my general, by your concord in the camp, and your valour in the field, we shall shortly have a famous victory over those enemies of my God, of my kingdom, and of my people.

Armada in Scotland and Ireland[edit]
Main article: Spanish Armada in Ireland

On the day after the battle at Gravelines, the disorganized and unmanouvreable Spanish fleet was at risk of running onto the sands of Zeeland because of the prevailing wind. The wind then changed to the south, enabling the fleet to sail north. The English ships under Howard pursued to prevent any landing on English soil, although by this time his ships were almost out of shot. On 12 August, Howard called a halt to the pursuit at about the latitude of the Firth of Forth off Scotland. The only option left to the Spanish ships was to return to Spain by sailing round the north of Scotland and home via the Atlantic or the Irish Sea. As the Spanish fleet rounded Scotland it on 20 August, it consisted of 110 vessels and most made it around.[73] The San Juan de Sicilia, heavily damaged during the Gravelines engagement had struggled North and limped into Tobermory bay on the Isle of Mull on 23 September but was later destroyed by an English agent sent by Sir Francis Walsingham with most of the crew on board.[80]

The Spanish ships were beginning to show wear from the long voyage, and some were kept together by strengthening their damaged hulls with cables. Supplies of food and water ran short. The intention would have been to keep to the west of the coasts of Scotland and Ireland, seeking the relative safety of the open sea. There being no way of accurately measuring longitude, the Spanish were not aware that the Gulf Stream was carrying them north and east as they tried to move west, and they eventually turned south much closer to the coast than they thought. Off Scotland and Ireland, the fleet ran into a series of powerful westerly winds which drove many of the damaged ships further toward the lee shore. Because so many anchors had been abandoned during the escape from the English fireships off Calais, many of the ships were incapable of securing shelter as the fleet reached the coast of Ireland and were driven onto the rocks; local inhabitants looted the ships. The late sixteenth century and especially 1588 was marked by unusually strong North Atlantic storms, perhaps associated with a high accumulation of polar ice off the coast of Greenland, a feature of the "Little Ice Age".[81] More ships and sailors were lost to cold and stormy weather than in direct combat.

Most of the 28 ships lost in the storms were along the jagged steep rocks of the western coast of Ireland.[73] About 5,000 men died by drowning, starvation and slaughter by local inhabitants after their ships were driven ashore on the west coasts of Scotland and Ireland. The English Lord Deputy William FitzWilliam ordered the English soldiers in Ireland to kill any Spanish prisoners, which was done on several occasions instead of asking for ransom as was common during that period.[82] Reports of the passage of the remnants of the Spanish Armada around Ireland abound with onerous accounts of hardships and survival.[83] One of the costliest wrecks was that of the ship Spanish galleass La Girona, which was driven on to Lacada Point in County Antrim on the night of 26 October. Of the estimated 1,300 people on board, there were nine survivors. 260 bodies washed ashore, including Alonso Martínez de Leiva [es], knight and trece of the Order of Santiago. Captain Francisco de Cuéllar was wrecked on the coast of Ireland and gave a remarkable account of his experiences in the fleet, on the run in Ireland, defeat of an English army besieging Rosclogher castle, flight through Scotland, surviving a second shipwreck and ultimate return to Spain.[84][85]

Destruction of the Invincible Armada by Spanish painter Jose Gartner – (1892)
Return to Spain[edit]

Continental Europe had been anxiously awaiting news of the Armada all summer. The Spanish postmaster and Spanish agents in Rome promoted reports of Spanish victory in hopes of convincing Pope Sixtus V to release his promise of one million ducats upon landing of troops. In France, the Spanish and English ambassadors promoted contradictory narratives in the press, and a Spanish victory was incorrectly celebrated in Paris, Prague, and Venice. It was not until late August that reliable reports of the Spanish defeat arrived in major cities and were widely believed.[86]

The first rumours of a setback for the armada began to reach Spain when news of the English fireships breaking the Spanish formation at Calais was received, but this was disbelieved. The King noted I hope God has not permitted so much evil. Nothing was heard for nearly two weeks and it wasn't until 21 September that the first of the ships of the Armada began to arrive into Spain – the first of eight limped into Coruña which included Medina Sidonia's San Martin. Over the next few days Diego Flores took 22 more into Laredo harbour and Miguel de Oquendo brought five more into the port of Guipuzcoa.[87]

By mid-October it was becoming more apparent for the Spanish that few if any more of the remaining missing ships of the armada would return. Even in November three months after the battles through the Channel, a few Spanish ships were still attempting the journey home.[88] One of the last, the Spanish hospital ship San Pedro El Mayor carrying some 200 sick and wounded survivors limped into Hope Cove in Devon on 7 November – the commander trying to find a suitable place to ground her. The crew were taken prisoner and the sick were treated in Bodmin and Plympton.[89][90]

Aftermath[edit]
Route taken by the Spanish Armada

After the Duke of Parma was certain that the Armada had sailed away from the coast of Flanders and his participation in the invasion project was no longer feasible, he ordered his soldiers to disembark so as to avoid an epidemic of disease.[91] He then assembled his Council of War to discuss what endeavours his forces could be used for before the onset of winter. In late September, he divided them into three groups; one was sent to the Rhine, one was to remain in the coastal region and one was led by Parma himself against Bergen-op-Zoom. There, in November, he was repelled with heavy losses by the Anglo-Dutch garrison, which, in combination with poor weather, forced him to abandon the siege.[92][93] An attempt to take the Dutch-held island of Tholen was also repelled. From the armada campaign to Bergen, Parma's forces had lost some 10,000 men killed or dead from disease.[94]

England and the Netherlands[edit]

Even though the Spanish armada had failed to invade England it had demonstrated its feasibility and shown that the British Isles overall were vulnerable to attack.[95]

The day after her Tilbury speech, Elizabeth ordered the army disbanded, the camp at Tilbury dissolved five days later, then discharged the navy, sending them home without pay.[96][97] All the while, the costs of this defensive effort were mounting – the total was nearly £400,000[98] – and measures were put in motion to mitigate it. Typhus, scurvy and dysentery swept the through the crews and many died of disease and starvation after landing at Margate. For instance, of the Elizabeth Bonaventure's crew of 500, more than 200 had died[99] and the Elizabeth Jonas had just one living from the crew that it had sailed with.[100] Howard wrote to Burghley, it would grieve any man's heart to see them that have served so valiantly die so miserably.[101] Hawkins also weighed in and accused Burghley "that by death, by discharging of sick men, and such like, that there may be spared something in the general pay."[102] The men had to rely on the charity of their officers, and Howard set an example by doing what he could out of his own purse to help the sailors. Nevertheless, upwards of 3,000 perished.[14][103] As a result, the Chatham Chest was set up– its purpose to help pay pensions to disabled seamen.[104][98]

It took some time for the scale of the victory to be realized as news began to filter through by the end of August and beginning of September.[105] As a result, a number of thanksgiving services were held at Cathedrals and Churches throughout England. At St Paul's Cathedral in London a series of thanksgivings took place, the first on 30 August where a sermon was preached, followed by another on 18 September. As news of the full scale of the disaster came through, and also news of England's victory against Parma at Bergen-Op-Zoom, a bigger National service of thanksgiving took place on 29 November.[106] A second and final thanksgiving took place five days later which saw a royal procession of the Queen in a chariot through the streets of London.[107] Twelve Spanish standards and other trophies which had been captured from the ships of the armada, decorated the choir of St Paul during the huge service.[108]

The captured Spanish galleons Nuestra Señora del Rosario and the San Salvador were studied by the English. The San Salvador became known as the 'Great Spaniard' but was lost in a wreck in November 1588 off Studland. Nuestra Señora del Rosario was brought to Dartmouth. The 397 crew were taken to Torre Abbey near Torquay where they were held prisoner in a barn (today called the 'Spanish Barn') and spared execution.[109] The Rosario was later sent to Chatham where she was dry docked and eventually sunk to support a wharf.[110] Pedro de Valdés was held prisoner in the Tower of London for five years, until his ransom was paid by his family for his release back to Spain. He was not blamed for the loss of his ship and was appointed colonial governor of Cuba from 1602 to 1608.[111]

The Dutch also celebrated the victory and their artists were quick to take on commemorative medals and paintings which were soon circulated within the year. The wrecked Spanish galleons San Mateo and San Felipe which had run aground were both found to be riddled with holes by cannonballs that had struck below the waterline. Both ships were too damaged to be salvaged and were therefore broken up – the cannons were used by the Dutch in nearby fortresses. The main-topmast rigging banner from the San Matteo – part of which depicts 'Christ on the Cross', was taken, hung and displayed in the choir of St Peters Church in Leiden. It now resides in the Museum De Lakenhal.[112]

Spain[edit]

The news of the disaster brought shock and despair and the nation went into mourning.[113] Its defeat was even more devastating because hopes of its success had been raised by false rumours. These included Drake and Howard being taken prisoner, the Isle of Wight and Plymouth taken and Parma's army even approaching London.[114] The King took the news hard and shut himself away for days – the daily business of government was also brought to an abrupt halt. The King is claimed to have said: "I sent the Armada against men, not God's winds and waves".[115] News of the loss of La Girona bore more despair for Philip, the loss of not only De Leiva but also his followers from almost every noble house in Spain had also drowned with him.[116]

The number of ships lost have been debated – a detailed study by Spanish naval historian Fernandez Duro in the mid-1880s claimed that 63 in total were lost.[117] Historian José Luis Casado Soto examined the fate of each ship creating individual dossiers and claimed that 35 ships were lost.[118] In addition it was noted that of the 122 Armada ships that entered the English Channel, 87 returned from their voyage through the Channel and around the British isles.[119] However these figures don't include eight that were unaccounted for.[120] Other historians have done further research; Neil Hanson, Robert Hutchinson, Colin Martin and Geoffrey Parker all researched the Armada ships that had returned coming to the same conclusion. The overall figure of between 44 and 51 ships being lost overall – with more detailed breakdowns in the number of ships that set sail along with their fate.[121][122] That figure being a third of the fleet had been sunk, captured, wrecked or scuttled.[123] American historian Garrett Mattingly noted that only 66 ships returned to Spain, with another returning later in the year.[124] The losses did not include the smaller vulnerable ships like the pataches and zarbas,[125] of which around seventeen were lost.[126] Even though most of the ships had returned, many of them were severely damaged from either the storms or English gunfire. One hulk the Doncella sank after they had cast anchor in Santander, and the Santa Anna was accidentally burned within a few days of entering San Sebastian.[127] In addition the severely damaged galleons San Marcos and San Francisco were broken up, the guns and the timber being sold off. As many as half of the fleet were unfit for further service and as a result a number were scuttled, broken up or left to rot.[128]

Furthermore, Spanish sources state that no more than 11,000 perished.[129][130][131] Philip's administrators, bureaucrats and secretaries documented, dated and filed everything that went on in all corners of the Spanish empire, and all those records are still kept in the National Archives of Spain and the Escorial. The number of men lost was extracted from the paymaster distribution lists.[132] A detailed analysis of the human cost of the campaign reveals that 25,696 men left Coruña and 13,399 returned.[133]

Even after arrival the men were near death from disease, as the conditions were very cramped, and most of the ships had run out of food and water. More Armada survivors later died in Spain or on hospital ships in Spanish harbours from diseases contracted during the voyage. A large number of prominent Spanish commanders also died, many after having arrived in port. Vice Admiral of the fleet and commander of the Guipuzcoa Squadron, Miguel de Oquendo suffering from battle wounds and a fever, died at Coruña two days after arriving. Another was the Biscayan squadron commander Juan Martínez de Recalde, who also succumbed the same way.[134] The Duke of Medina Sidonia also fell ill on his return and nearly succumbed; he was not blamed by Philip, who allowed him to return home to convalesce. Hutchinson claimed that the number of survivors was just over 50% but these numbers however do not include the Portuguese, the Neapolitans and the galley slaves.[135] while Hanson claimed that fewer than 10,000 men (38%) survived the expedition.[136]

English Counter Armada[edit]
Main article: English Armada

The following year the English with Dutch conscripts launched the Counter Armada, under Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norris with three tasks:

Destroy the battered Spanish Atlantic fleet, which was being repaired in ports of northern Spain
Make a landing at Lisbon, Portugal and raise a revolt there against King Philip II (Philip I of Portugal) installing the pretender Dom António, Prior of Crato to the Portuguese throne
Take the Azores if possible so as to establish a permanent base.

None of the objectives were achieved.[137][138][139][140] The attempt to restore the Portuguese Crown from Spain was unsuccessful, and the opportunity to strike a decisive blow against the weakened Spanish Navy was lost. The expedition depleted the financial resources of England's treasury, which had been carefully restored during the long reign of Elizabeth I. Through this lost opportunity, Philip was able revive his navy the very next year, sending 37 ships with 6,420 men to Brittany where they established a base of operations on the Blavet river. The English and Dutch ultimately failed to disrupt the various fleets of the Indies despite the great number of military personnel mobilized every year. Thus, Spain remained the predominant power in Europe for several decades.[141]

Course of the war[edit]

During the course of the war, the Spanish struggled to gain control of the English Channel or stop the English intervention in Flanders or English privateer transatlantic raids. From their base in Brittany, Spanish corsairs did make several incursions on the English coast and plundered English and Dutch ships.[142] The Spanish launched a number of small scale attacks such as the Raid on Mount's Bay in Cornwall on 26 July 1595, where over two days, Penzance, Newlyn, Mousehole, and Paul were raided and torched. Another smaller raid on Cawsand bay, also in Cornwall, took place the following year but ended in failure.[143] In June 1596 England and the United Dutch Provinces sent a second Armada to Spain, where they seized and held Cadiz for two weeks causing economic losses, but failed to seize the treasure fleet. After this, three more armadas were sent by Spain – the second sent in 1596 (126–140 ships) was scattered by a storm, as was the third sent the following year (140 ships), with a number captured or sunk by the English fleet. The last Armada (33 ships) sent in October 1601 to Ireland, ended with the surrender at Kinsale three months later.[144] The conflict then wound down with diminishing military actions, finally ending with the signing of the Treaty of London in August 1604.

Technological revolution[edit]
Day seven of the battle with the Armada, 7 August 1588, by Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom, 1601

The Spanish had 117 ships to go up against 200+ English ships. The opposing forces were experienced in completely different fighting styles. The Spanish style can be studied from the Battle of Lepanto. Their tactics were to fire one cannon volley, ram and grapple the enemy ship, board, then engage in hand-to-hand combat. In contrast, the English style was taking advantage of the wind (the "weather gage") and line-to-line cannon fire from windward, which exposed the opponent ship's hull and rudder as targets. Also instilled was the use of naval cannon to damage enemy ships without the need to board. Until then, the cannon had played a supporting role to the main tactic of ramming and boarding enemy ships.[145] The failure of the Spanish Armada vindicated the English strategy and caused a revolution in naval tactics. The English also had the advantage of fighting close to home which they could be easily and frequently get resupplied so as not to be weighed down, unlike the Armada ships which were loaded with all the materiel needed for their invasion force to wage a ground based war. Nevertheless, when the fleets actually came to blows at the battle of Gravelines, the Armada was out numbered 10:1,[63] and during the 8-hour fight, the English managed to sink one carrack and forced two galleons, a pinnace and an armed merchant to run aground. Despite those odds, not once did the Armada turn away from a fight; each time it challenged the English fleet, the latter raised its sails to keep its distance.%5B146%5D%20Furthermore%2C%20after%20the%20final%20engagement%20with%20the%20English%20fleet%2C%20the%20Spanish%20fleet%20sailed%20away%20retaining%20its%20ability%20to%20effectively%20wage%20war.%5B147%5D%0A%0AMost%20military%20historians%20hold%20that%20the%20battle%20of%20Gravelines%20reflected%20a%20lasting%20shift%20in%20the%20balance%20of%20naval%20power%20in%20favour%20of%20the%20English%2C%20in%20part%20because%20of%20the%20gap%20in%20naval%20technology%20and%20cannon%20armament%20which%20continued%20into%20the%20next%20century.%5B148%5D%20In%20the%20words%20of%20historian%20Geoffrey%20Parker%2C%20by%201588%2C%20%22the%20capital%20ships%20of%20the%20Elizabethan%20navy%20constituted%20the%20most%20powerful%20battlefleet%20afloat%20anywhere%20in%20the%20world%22.%5B149%5D%20The%20English%20navy%20yards%20were%20leaders%20in%20technical%20innovation%2C%20and%20the%20captains%20devised%20new%20battle%20formations%20and%20tactics.%20The%20sleeker%20and%20more%20manoeuvrable%20full-rigged%20ship%2C%20with%20ample%20cannon%2C%20was%20one%20of%20the%20greatest%20advances%20of%20the%20century%20and%20permanently%20transformed%20naval%20warfare.%0A%0AEnglish%20shipwrights%20introduced%20novel%20designs%2C%20first%20demonstrated%20in%20the%20Foresight%20in%201570%20and%20the%20Dreadnought%20in%201573%2C%20that%20allowed%20the%20ships%20to%20sail%20faster%2C%20manoeuvre%20better%2C%20and%20carry%20more%20and%20heavier%20guns.%5B150%5D%20Whereas%20before%20warships%20had%20tried%20to%20grapple%20with%20each%20other%20so%20soldiers%20could%20board%20the%20enemy%20ship%2C%20they%20were%20able%20to%20stand%20off%20and%20fire%20broadside%20cannonades%20that%20could%20sink%20the%20vessel.%20English%20ships%20and%20seamanship%20had%20foiled%20the%20invasion.%20The%20English%20also%20benefited%20from%20Spain%27s%20unworkable%20strategy%20that%20required%20coordination%20between%20the%20invasion%20fleet%20and%20the%20Spanish%20army%20on%20shore%20yet%20didn%27t%20seem%20to%20have%20learned%20from%20that%20mistake%20since%20they%20attempted%20the%20same%20tactic%20in%20Portugal%20the%20very%20next%20year%3B%20the%20English%20army%20under%20Norris%27%20command%20marching%20on%20Lisbon%20expecting%20Drake%20to%20simultaneously%20attack%20the%20city%20with%20his%20ships.%5B151%5D%20The%20outdated%20design%20of%20the%20Spanish%20cannon%20meant%20that%20they%20were%20much%20slower%20in%20reloading%20in%20a%20close-range%20battle%2C%20allowing%20the%20English%20to%20take%20control.%20Spain%20still%20had%20numerically%20larger%20fleets%2C%20but%20England%20was%20catching%20up.%5B152%5D%0A%0ALegacy%5Bedit%5D%0A%0AIn%20England%2C%20the%20battle%20was%20followed%20by%20the%20distribution%20of%20flyers%2C%20pamphlets%2C%20the%20striking%20of%20victory%20medals%2C%20and%20numerous%20joyous%20celebrations.%5B153%5D%5B154%5D%5B155%5D%20The%20victory%20prompted%20a%20huge%20David%20vs%20Goliath%20propaganda%20offensive%2C%5B156%5D%20and%20its%20exploitation%20boosted%20national%20pride%20which%20lasted%20for%20years.%20Elizabeth%27s%20legend%20persisted%20and%20grew%20long%20after%20her%20death.%20It%20also%20may%20have%20given%20heart%20to%20the%20Protestant%20cause%20across%20Europe%20and%20the%20belief%20that%20God%20was%20behind%20the%20Protestants.%5B157%5D%20This%20was%20shown%20by%20the%20striking%20of%20commemorative%20medals%20that%20bore%20variations%20on%20the%20inscription%2C%20%221588.%20Flavit%20Jehovah%20et%20Dissipati%20Sunt%22%20%E2%80%93%20with%20%22Jehovah%22%20in%20Hebrew%20letters%20(%27God%20blew%2C%20and%20they%20are%20scattered%27)%2C%20or%20%27He%20blew%20with%20His%20winds%2C%20and%20they%20were%20scattered%27.%20There%20were%20also%20more%20lighthearted%20medals%20struck%2C%20such%20as%20the%20one%20with%20the%20play%20on%20the%20words%20of%20Julius%20Caesar%3A%20Venit%2C%20Vidit%2C%20Fugit%20(%27he%20came%2C%20he%20saw%2C%20he%20fled%27).%20The%20wind%20that%20scattered%20the%20Armada%20has%20been%20called%20the%20Protestant%20Wind%2C%5B158%5D%20a%20phrase%20also%20used%20for%20later%20invasions%20of%20England%20that%20failed.%0A%0AThe%20memory%20of%20the%20victory%20over%20the%20Armada%20was%20evoked%20during%20both%20the%20Napoleonic%20Wars%20and%20the%20Second%20World%20War%2C%20when%20Britain%20again%20faced%20a%20substantial%20danger%20of%20foreign%20invasion.%20During%20the%20Battle%20of%20Britain%20RAF%20fighter%20pilots%20attracted%20world%20attention%20as%20the%20%22new%20Elizabethans%22.%5B159%5D%20The%20Armada%20Memorial%20in%20Plymouth%20was%20constructed%20in%201888%20to%20celebrate%20the%20tercentenary%20of%20the%20defeat%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Armada.%5B160%5D%0A%0AOne%20of%20the%20greatest%20finds%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Armada%20was%20the%20remains%20of%20the%20wreck%20of%20La%20Girona%2C%20found%20by%20a%20team%20of%20Belgian%20divers%20off%20the%20coast%20of%20Portballintrae%20in%201968.%20It%20was%20the%20greatest%20treasure%20salvaged%20up%20until%20that%20time.%5B161%5D%20Gold%2

Historiography[edit]

For 150 years, writers relied heavily on Augustine Ryther's translation of Petruccio Ubaldini's Expeditionis Hispaniorum in Angliam vera Descriptio (A discourse concerninge the Spanishe fleete inuadinge Englande in the yeare 1588) (1590),[162] which argued that God decisively favoured the Protestant cause. In the 17th century, William Camden additionally pointed to elements of English nationalism and the private enterprise of the sea dogs. He also emphasized that the Duke of Medina Sidonia was an incompetent seaman.[citation needed] In the 18th century, David Hume praised the leadership of Queen Elizabeth.[citation needed] However, the Whig historians, led by James A. Froude, rejected Hume's interpretation and argued that Elizabeth was vacillating and almost lost the conflict by her unwillingness to spend enough to maintain and supply the Royal Navy's fleet of ships.[citation needed] Scientific modern historiography came of age with the publication of two volumes of primary documents by John Knox Laughton in 1894.[163] This enabled the leading naval scholar of the day, Julian Corbett, to reject the Whig views and turn attention to the professionalization of the Royal Navy as a critical factor.[citation needed] Twentieth-century historians have focused on technical issues, such as the comparative power of English and Spanish naval guns and the degree of credit for naval battle tactics that is owed to Francis Drake and Charles Howard. Inclement weather in the English Channel and on the oceans at the time has always been cited as a major factor to the outcome. Historian Knerr has reviewed the main trends in historiography over five centuries.[164]

Notable participants[edit]
William Adams served on the Richarde Dyffylde, a resupply ship during the campaign. In 1600, he was the first Englishman to reach (and settle in) Japan via the Dutch United East India Company (VOC) becoming one of the first of few Western Samurai.[165]
Lope de Vega, one of the key figures in the Spanish Golden Age of Baroque literature, and one of the most prolific authors in the history of literature, served in the ship San Juan during the Spanish Armada.
In popular culture[edit]

The Armada has often featured in fictional accounts of the reign of Elizabeth I. Examples are:

The Battle of Gravelines and the subsequent chase around the northern coast of Scotland form the climax of Charles Kingsley's 1855 novel Westward Ho!, which in 1925 became the first novel to be adapted into a radio drama by BBC.[166]
The fifth episode of the BBC series Elizabeth R is an account of the defeat of the Armada.
The 2007 film Elizabeth: The Golden Age contains a heavily fictionalized retelling of the Spanish Armada and the Battle of Gravelines.
