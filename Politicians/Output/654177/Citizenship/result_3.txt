Two processes have invested cities in the last twenty years: an increase
of the "mobile" population and the explosion of digital, with particular
Attention to the Digital Social Networks. The debate, academic and public,
immediately highlighted the risky potential inherent in these
changes, as possible managers of greater individualism
and disinterest towards the care of one's neighborhood. Yet, forms of attack
urban level continue to appear in the cities, even with
Rather innovative and spontaneous ways. One of these is that of
Social street, groups of neighbors previously without relationships, that yes
they know thanks to Facebook and activate themselves by promoting conviviality in
quarter.
This book, the result of a sociological analysis, reconstructs the spread of
Social Street phenomenon in the three cities with the most experienced experiences,
studying the reason for a non -homogeneous diffusion within the cities.
Analyze the opinions and feelings of the activists, understanding if and how
This phenomenon produces effects on those who participate and on the neighborhoods
who host them. Deepens the forms of mobilization that social media
Street promote for the care and sociability of their own way and the quarter
tiere and how these detach themselves from more traditional associative realities.
Particular attention is given to the comparative approach, to understanding
that is, the differences between those who participate in social students and those who
they do not participate, showing how urban conviviality is possible,
But facilitated by some factors and hindered by others.
Niccolò Morelli is a fixed -term researcher in sociology at the
Department of Political and International Science of the University of Genoa,
where he teaches sociology. His research interests concern construction
identity, community and safety in urban spaces through con-
viviality, the development of phenomena at the turn of the digital and physical dimension,
digital and generational inequalities.
