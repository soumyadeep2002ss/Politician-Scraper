Scope of Activities:  
IOSCO was established  in  1983.  Its membership  regulates  more  than  95%  of  the  world's  
securities markets in some 130 jurisdictions and includes all the major emerging markets. 
 
The IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation have been endorsed by both 
the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as the relevant standards in this area. They are 
IOSCO ́s main instrument to develop and implement internationally recognized and consistent 
standards of regulation, oversight and enforcement. They form the basis for the evaluation of 
the securities sector for the Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs) of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.   
 
Objectives 
 
IOSCO members have resolved: 
 
• to  cooperate  in  developing,  implementing  and  promoting  adherence  to  internationally  
recognized  and  consistent  standards  of  regulation,  oversight  and  enforcement  to  protect  
investors, maintain fair, efficient and transparent markets and seek to address systemic risks; 
 
• to enhance investor protection and promote investor confidence in the integrity of securities 
markets,  through  strengthened  information  exchange  and  cooperation  in  enforcement  
against misconduct and in supervision of markets and market intermediaries; and 
 
• to exchange information at both global and regional levels on their respective experiences 
to  assist  the  development  of  markets,  strengthen  market  infrastructure  and  implement

Categories of Members: 
 
There are three categories of members: ordinary, associate and affiliate.  In general, the ordinary 
members  (131)  are  the  national  securities  commissions  in  their  respective  jurisdictions.    
Associate  members  (33)  are  usually  agencies  or  branches  of  government,  other  than  the  
principal national securities regulator in their respective jurisdictions,  that have some regulatory 
competence  over  securities  markets.   National  securities  regulators  that  are  not  ordinary  
members  or IOSCO MMoU

  signatories  are  also  in  this  category. Other  associate  members  
include intergovernmental  international  organizations,  suchas  the  IMF  and  the  World  Bank, 
and  other  international  standard-setting  bodies,  such  as  the  European  Securities  and  Markets  
Authority,  with  a  mission  related  either to the  development  or  the  regulation  of  securities  
markets. Affiliate members (70) are self-regulatory organizations, stock exchanges,  financial  
market infrastructures, investor protection funds and compensation funds, and other bodies with 
an appropriate interest in securities regulation.
