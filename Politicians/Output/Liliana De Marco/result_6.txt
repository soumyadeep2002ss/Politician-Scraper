51ST PLENARY SESSION OF THE COMMITTEE ON WORLD FOOD SECURITY

Statement by International Development Law Organization (IDLO), delivered by IDLO Director of External Relations and Partnerships, Liliana De Marco

Rome, Italy
 

Excellencies,

It is a pleasure to address this plenary session on behalf of the International Development Law Organization in our Observer capacity.

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report has repeatedly highlighted that the intensification of conflict, the devastating effects of climate change, and economic crises, combined with growing inequalities, are pushing us off track to meet the SDG 2 targets.

To address these intersecting global challenges, the significance of cross-cutting, intersectoral, and systemic approaches, as well as mutual collaboration cannot be overstated.

IDLO is the only global intergovernmental organization exclusively devoted to promoting the rule of law to advance peace and sustainable development. Our 40-year experience has shown that the rule of law can serve as a catalyst, enabling the achievement of all 17 Sustainable Development Goals, including our commitment to realizing a world with zero hunger.

Realizing the right to adequate food for all will not be achieved only by satisfying immediate needs. At IDLO, we apply an integrated approach combining research, programming, and policy advocacy to eliminate systemic barriers that lead to unequal production, procurement, and distribution of food.

In our new policy brief titled Rule of Law for Food Systems Transformation, we emphasize three key elements that can contribute to accelerating food systems transformation through the rule of law.

First, we must empower the most food insecure people. Women, youth, indigenous peoples, smallholder farmers, and people on the move should be able to engage with duty-bearers and justice systems to realize their rights.

Second, we must work with governments to create sound legal and regulatory frameworks and effective institutions, enhancing transparency and accountability and enabling inclusive decision-making.

Third, we must improve and safeguard equitable access to land, water, and other natural resources by protecting diverse forms of tenure, including traditional and customary rights to land and other resources.

On this occasion, we look forward to collaborating with all partners in promoting an all-encompassing, coordinated, and intersectoral strategy to address hunger.
