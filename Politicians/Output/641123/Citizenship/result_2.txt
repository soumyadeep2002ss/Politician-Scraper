1. Introduction1
The  creation  of  European  citizenship  was  greeted  as  a  significant  step
towards a more 'politicised' form of Union, although the limits to this new
status posed by the nationality of member states were identified (Closa;
1995).  Several  years  after  the  Treaty  of  Maastricht,  some  of  the

obstacles  to  the  effective  implementation  of  this  new  status  are  now
evident.  These  are,  in  the  one  hand,  genuine  practical  difficulties  for
putting  rights  into  effect.  But  secondly,  collusion  with  national  views  on
citizenship have been more evident.
The  case  of  Spain  is  particularly  interesting  for  a  number  of  reasons.
Firstly, the Spanish government was the proponent and leading advocate
for  the  inclusion  of  EU  citizenship  in  the  Treaty  on  European  Union.  The
second  and  third  reasons  derive  from  Spanish  political  characteristics:
democratic citizenship was only recovered in the 1970s after a 40 years
dictatorship  and  it  was  recovered  under  the  shape  of  a  multilevel
citizenship.  This  paper  presents  an  overview  of  the  relationship  between
Spanish  and  EU  citizenship.  Four  aspects  are  taken  into  account  in  order
to provide evidence for a future evaluation. The Spanish configuration of
citizenship is summarily presented in the first section on the basis of an
exegesis  of  constitutional  provisions  and  constitutional  court  case-law.
The  process  of  adjustment  to  new  political  context  and  international
environment (immigration) should orientate the research to the redesign
of an old institution rather than focusing on the historical tradition. Then,
the relationship between the identities which underlie in both institutions
is described by reference to the perceptions in public opinion. Thirdly, the
implementation of EU rights in Spain shows some of the problems for the
adjustment  of  the  new  institution.  Finally,  the  Spanish  proposal  for  the
development  of  EU  citizenship  rights  in  the  1996  IGC  is  referred.  These
four elements provide an impressionistic account from which conclusions
may be very cautious.
2. Spanish configuration of citizenship
The  Spanish  configuration  of  citizenship  has  to  be  established  on  the
background of a contemporary event: the transition to democracy in the
second half of the 1970s The political transition which ended 40 years of
authoritarianism  and  initiated  democratic  politics  and  it  offered  an
opportunity  for  recasting  both  the  institution  and  the  practice  of
citizenship.   In   Spain,   there   has   existed   traditionally   a   conceptual
difference between the statute of individuals ad extra (nationality) and ad
extra (citizenship). Broadly stated. democratisation stimulated changes in
both  dimensions  but  to  a  different  extent.  In  terms  of  nationality,  the
adaptation   sought   was   to   eliminate   or   reduce   state   prerogatives.

particularly  on  lost  and  deprivation  of  it  stemming  from  historical
reminiscences or the authoritarian character of the regime. In the internal
dimension,   changes   were   more   important.   Following   the   classical
classification of Marshall, the authoritarian regime had eroded political and
civic  rights,  but  it  was  not  necessarily  so  with  social  rights:  the  social
paternalism  of  francoism  did  not  imply  an  ideological  inconsistency  with
these. some of which were developed in particular fashion.
The 1978 Spanish Constitution (SC) provided the positive foundation for
the  crystallisation  of  the  new  definition  of  the  institution  of  citizenship.
The  historical  moment  meant  that  the  new  rules  embedded  a  host  of
international  conventions  on  political,  social  and  economic  rights.  Also,
economic and social rights were more perfected than in earlier stages of
Spanish  constitutionalism.  There  are  three  main  traits  which  might  be
singled  out  to  obtain  an  impressionistic  picture  of  it.  The  first  is  the
conception of Spanish nationality, the second is the articulation between
nationality/citizenship and rights and the third is the multilevel character
of citizenship induced by the new configuration of the state.
2.1 Spanish nationality
The explicit constitutional regulation of Spanish nationality is scarce, since
remission is made to law for acquisition, conservation and loss. Differently
to  former  Spanish  constitutions,  there  is  no  current  constitutional
definition  of  what  a  Spanish  is  and  remission  is  made  to  the  laws  for
acquisition,  lost  and  recovery  rules.  The  law  regulating  this  is  the  Civil
Code (CC, Arts. 17-26)), which was reformed in three rounds to adapt it
to the new democratic and social context.2 In 1982, the nationality rules
were  adapted  to  the  new  democratic  constitution:  thus,  in  comparison
with  the  former  authoritarian  regime,  a  characteristic  of  democratic
nationality  is  that  no  original  Spanish  (i.e.  at  birth)  can  be  deprived  of
Spanish  nationality  (Art.  11.2  SC).  This  goes  more  in  the  direction  of
State prerogatives vis-a-vis individuals than as an attempt to configure a
more  open  nationality  regime.  In  1990  and  following  complains  from  the
Ombudsman  and  immigrant  sections  of  the  main  unions,  the  law  was
revised  to  eliminate  certain  logical  inconsistencies.  The  last  of  the
proposals  for  reform  of  nationality  law  were  debated  by  the  Spanish
Parliament in late 1996.3 Both, presented by United Left and the Socialist
