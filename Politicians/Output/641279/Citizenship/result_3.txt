The Embassy of Egypt in London is the diplomatic mission of Egypt in the United Kingdom.[1]

Egypt also maintains several other buildings in London: a consulate general at 2 Lowndes Street, Belgravia, a press and information Office at 299 Oxford Street, a cultural office at 4 Chesterfield Gardens, Mayfair and a medical office at 47 Longridge Road, Earl's Court.[1]

There have been several protests outside the embassy in recent years: in 2011 during the protests against Hosni Mubarak,[2] in 2013 following the violent clashes in Cairo between supporters and opponents of Mohammed Morsi[3] and also in 2013 there was a protest against the rise of sexual attacks against women in Egypt.[4]
