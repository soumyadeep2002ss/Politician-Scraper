Meanwhile, BJP leader and former deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad said Samrat Chaudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha will be the party's faces for the deputy CM position.

"Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha have been elected as leader and deputy leader of the legislative party, respectively. Most certainly, they will be our face for the deputy CM position," he told PTI.

Samrat Chaudhary thanks BJP

After being elected as the leader of the legislative party, Samrat Chaudhary thanked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

"BJP did a historic thing for my life...This is an emotional moment for me to have been elected as the Leader of the Legislative Party to be a part of the government. The mandate that we received in 2020 for the development of Bihar and to end the terror of Lalu Yadav - when the BJP received the proposal from Nitish Kumar to ensure that there is no jungle raj in Bihar and Sanjay Jha came here as his ambassador, we decided to support it," he said.

Nitish Kumar resigns

Nitish Kumar on Sunday said he has exited the Bihar Mahagathbandhan because he was not getting any response from the Opposition's INDIA bloc.

"Today, I have resigned as the chief minister and I have also told the Governor to dissolve the government in the state," he told reporters after tendering his resignation to Governor Rajendra Arlekar.

Kumar said the situation in the Mahagathbandhan government was not good.

"I decided after taking views of all...I was making all out effort to make the INDIA bloc running…but no response was coming," he added.
