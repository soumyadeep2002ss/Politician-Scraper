Under his leadership, Portugal adopted a comprehensive Green Taxation Reform [7] and the Portuguese Green Growth Commitment.[8] Also during his tenure, the Portuguese government named SUMA, a consortium led by the country’s Mota-Engil construction company, as the winning bidder in the privatization of waste management firm EGF with an offer of 149.9 million euros ($193 million) in 2014.[9] In 2015, he agreed to sell the operating rights for the Lisbon Oceanarium to Sociedade Francisco Manuel dos Santos for a larger-than-expected 114 million euros ($127 million).[10]

He also led the development of a new development finance measurement tool, the Total Official Support for Sustainable Development (TOSSD).
