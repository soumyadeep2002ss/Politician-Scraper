(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a process for producing bisphenol A by reacting phenol with acetone, wherein reaction is performed at higher 
temperatures while maintaining high selectivity, and thus high productivity is obtained. The invention relates to a cation-exchange resin, where in a 
cation-exchange group is introduced into a syndiotactic polystyrene polymer and the amount of acid is 0.8 milliequivalent/g or more, to a catalyst 
comprising the cation-exchange resin, and to a process for producing bisphenol A using the cation-exchange resin catalyst.
