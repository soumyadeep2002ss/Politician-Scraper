The town lies 10 degrees north in latitude and 70 degrees east in longitude and lies 32.31 m above mean sea level. The small river Vellar goes through the outer part of Aranthangi.

The main centre of attraction is a ruined fort. The walls are not constructed of brick or stone. Large interstices are filled with mud. There are no ruins of palaces or any other striking building inside. There is no indication when the fort could have been built. A line of Tondaimans who were unconnected with those of Pudukkottai, were in power here in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and it is believed that they constructed it. The temple of Rajendra Chola Varma in the town seems to have been built in the eleventh century.

Aranthangi was ruled by Thondaimans (different from Pudukkottai Thondaimans) in earlier days.(The time is unknown; see the book Pudukkottai Maavatta Varalaru.)
