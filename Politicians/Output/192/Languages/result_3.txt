India writes in many languages and speaks in many more voices. 
And   yet,   communication   has   never   broken   down   in   this   sub-
continent. With about 2.4% of the world's land surface and a total 
of 16% of the world's population (India: A Country Study by James 
Heitzman   and   Robert   L.   Worden   eds.   Federal   Research   Division; 
1995),   India   houses   according   to   one   estimate,   1,652   “mother-
tongues” – including 103 foreign mother tongues (Census 1961 & 
Nigam 1972: p. xv).  
Writing came to India much earlier than many other civilizations – 
from the days of the Indus Valley Civilization, by over four thousand 
years ago, and the space has also witnessed emergence of some of 
the   great   writing   systems   like   the  Brāhmī  and   the  Kharosthī  – 
dating   back   to   roughly   500   B.C.   Today,   India   is   a   space   with 
perhaps the largest base of books, authors and publication houses 
with about at least 70,000 new titles published every year, enjoyed 
by over 600 million readers of books in India.

1. The Indian Linguistic Space
The earliest form of speech in India were reflected in the texts such as  Rig-Veda, the 
Brahmanas, and the Upanishads   - the oldest preserved treatises from which the Indian 
"literary" traditions of verse have sprung. The earliest works were composed to be sung 
or recited, and were orally transmitted for many generations before being written down. 
The oldest among them are the thousand-odd hymns of the Rig-vedas dating back to two 
millenium B.C. , composed in what is called the Vedic Sanskrit. The Vedas, which derived 
from the root vid -  "to know",  tried capturing knowledge that came from the quest for 
the unknown.
The Indian literary tradition demonstrated that early Indian creative writers interacted 
very closely with critical thinkers, and a very rich interpretive tradition developed just as 
they excelled in literary creativity in a number of genres – beginning from poetry and in 

its epic form to story-telling as well as to the dramas. While a lot of these early texts 
dabbled   with   the   idea   of   the   ‘sacred’,   even   the   most   revered   texts   like   the   Vedas 
demonstrated that there were streaks of both in its body. 
The early literary theoreticians could identify different sentiments being reflected in these 
writings, which have been trend-setters in world literature in many ways.
The Indian linguistic space, as it exists today in truncated form in the South Asian sub-
continent – after its independence in 1947, has been a new geo-political identity. But 
India has, in all  ages,  been  a concept – more  true  on  the mental map than being a 
physical reality. At the same time, she has also contributed to numerous ideas that form 
the basis of modern-day knowledge-based society.  
2. Mother-Tongues and Languages
There   are   different   theories   abouthow   many   of   these   mother-tongues   qualify   to   be 
described   as   independent   languages.   Even   Sir   George   Grierson's   twelve-volume 
Linguistic Survey of India  (1903-1923)   – material  for  which  was  collected   in   the  last 
decade of the 19
th
  century, had identified 179 languages and 544 dialects. One of the 
early Census reports also showed 188 languages and 49 dialects (1921 census).
Out of these mother-tongues, 184 (Census 1991) or at least, 112 (Census 1981 figure) 
had more than 10,000 speakers. There are other estimates that would put the number 
higher   or   lower;   For   instance,   the   encyclopaedic   People   of   India   series   of   the 
Anthropological Survey of India, identified 75 "major languages" out of a total of 325 
languages used in Indian households.  Ethnologue, too reports India as a home for 398 
languages, including 387 living and 11 extinct languages. Most importantly, as early as in 
the1990s, India was reported to have 32 languages with one million or more speakers. 
The  People of India  also reports that there are 25 writing systems in India that are in 
active use as in 1990s. The results of a 1989-survey titled  ‘The Written Languages of 
The World : A Survey of the Degree and Modes of Use (2. INDIA, Book 1, Constitutional 
Languages,   Book   2,   Non-Constitutional   Languages)’   conducted   by   P.Padmanabha   , 
B.P.Mahapatra , V.S.Verma , G.D.McConnell (Office of the Registrar General, India, Laval 
University Press) showed that there are at least 50 Indian languages in which writing and 
publishing are done in substantial quantity.
3. The Writing Systems
3.1. The Indus Valley Script
The Indus Valley Script  was a product of the now well-known Indus Valley Civilization. 
The greater Indus region was home to the largest of the four ancient urban civilizations, 
others   being   the   Egyptian,   Mesopotamian,   and   Chinese  civilizations.   Most   of   its   ruins 
remain to be fully excavated and studied, as nothing was known about this civilization 
until   1920s.   What   is   more,   the   ancient   Indus   script   has   not   yet   been   deciphered   – 
although there have been many claims and counter-claims. 
The samples of Indus Valley Script are huge - about 1000 settlements spreading all of 
modern Pakistan, and parts of India and Afghanistan.   But the main corpus of writing 
include 2,000 inscribed brief seals and tablets of 6 to 26 symbols each which are still 
undeciphered.  There are several competing theories about the language which the Indus 
script represents. But it appears that there was an equally strong multi-racial and multi-
lingual existence then which has further contributed to the difficulties in decipherment.

3.2. The Brāhmī  Script
There were many other systems of writing but none had as far reaching effect as the 
Brāhmī  script.  George  Bühler  in   his   1895-98   work,   entitled  Sitzungsberichte der 
kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien,  (Philologisch-historische   Classe  132, 
no.5, 1895. 2nd revised ed.: Strassburg: Karl J. Trübner, 1898; Rept Varanasi, 1963) had 
conjectured   that   one   of   the   earliest   writing   systems   in   India,   the  Brāhmī  script   had 
perhaps originated as far back as in the 8
th
 Century B.C. 
Some  trace  Brāhmī  to  Indus  Script.  But   theHarappan   ended  by  1900  BC  &  the first 
Brahmi and Kharoshthi inscriptions date to roughly 500 BC. It is difficult to explain the 
gap. 
Brahmi is a "syllabic alphabet", meaning that each character carries a consonant plus a 
neutral vowel "a", like Old Persian, but unlike it, Brāhmī  uses the same consonant with 
extra strokes to combine with different vowels. 
Bühler   argued   for   a   Phoenician   script,   although   some   other   specialists   like   Diringer 
thought   of   an   Aramaic   origin   of   Brāhmī.   There   are   controversies   as   to   whether   one 
should accept what the studies of Fussman, von Hinüber, and Falk concluded, namely 
that this script was only datable from the time of Ashoka, or whether – as many Indian 
epigraphists argued, its dates could be pushed back much further.
3.3. The Kharosthī  Script
The Kharosthi Script was almost contemporarily with the Brāhmī, and it appeared by 3rd 
c.  BC in northern Pakistan and east Afghanistan. Some examples of Kharosthi are also 
found in India. 
Kharosthi was used primarily for the Prakrit dialect of Gandhari. In structure & sequence, 
Kharosthi and  Brāhmī  are similar, except that   Brāhmī  had different signs for different 
initial   vowels,  but   it    used   the   same   marks   that   change   vowels   in   Consonant-Vowel 
combinations, and while Brāhmī had long and short vowel signs, Kharosthi had only one. 
Kharosthi Script fell out of use by the 3rd or 4th century A.D. 
3.4. Modern-day Writing Systems
Although Indian writing systems number at least 25 in a recent survey, the major scripts 
are  14,  out  of  which  12  originated  from  the  Brāhmī.  Like the Greek alphabet,  it  had 
many local variants  and  gave rise to many Asian scripts - Burmese, Thai, Tibetan, etc. 
Emperor Asoka inscribed his laws as well as Lord Buddha’s teachings onto columns  in 
Brahmi.
