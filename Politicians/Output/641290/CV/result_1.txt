Jean-Paul Servais appointed Chair of the New IOSCO Board 
The  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO)  is  pleased  to  announce  the  
appointment of Mr. Jean-Paul Servais as Chair of the new IOSCO Board.  
Mr.  Servais, Chairman of Belgium's Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA), Vice Chair of 
the IOSCO Board and Chair of the European Regional Committee, was appointed IOSCO Chair during 
the Board’s inaugural meeting at IOSCO’s 2022 Annual Meeting in Marrakesh. 
Mr. Servais will replace Mr. Ashley Alder as Chairman of the Board. The new Board also appointed two 
Vice Chairs to succeed Mr Servais: Mr. Ariizumi Shigeru, Vice Commissioner for International Affairs, 
Financial Services Agency, Japan, and Mr. Rostin Behnam, Chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission. Dr.   Mohamed  Farid  Saleh,  Executive  Chairman  of  the  Financial  Regulatory  Authority,  
Egypt is Chair of the Growth and Emerging Markets (GEM) Committee and continues ex oficio as an 
IOSCO Board Vice Chair. 
The  new  Board  acknowledged  Mr.  Alder’s outstanding contribution  to  IOSCO.  During  his  six-year 
tenure, Mr. Alder worked to enhance the relationship between IOSCO and the Financial Stability Board. 
Today, the  two  organizations  work  more  effectively  together  to  mitigate  financial  stability  risks  and  
protect investors. 
Also, under Mr. Alder ́s guidance, the Board improved its priority setting process, enabling IOSCO to 
tackle from a position of strength pressing regulatory challenges as they arose. IOSCO assumed a leading 
role on regulatory work   regarding   sustainable   finance,   market   fragmentation   and technological 
innovation, among others.  
Mr. Servais is a well-known figure in international regulatory circles.
