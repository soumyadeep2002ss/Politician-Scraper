Last Year Saw The First Complete Non-Financial Reporting Against The Eu #taxonomy in Europe. The Research and Analysis on this Data Makes for Intersting Reading - Highly recommends Evan Tylenda, CFA's Latest Piece in the series "GS Sustain: EU Taxonomy Monitor". Sub Key Findings:
üå≥ Green Revenue Exposure for Reporting Companies Averaged 23%, While Green Capex Was 24%.
üå≥ Both Eu Taxonomy Leaders (High Revenue) and Transition Companies (Green Capex> Green Revenue) Outperformed Bleckmarks Over The Last 5 Years

The Compendium proves that the Taxonomy and the wider Sustainable Finance Framework is starting to work on the ground. I gathered two key takeaways:
 
1. The power of capex-alignment and capex plans as a critical part of companies‚Äô financial planning and transition plans. Companies are starting to use the taxonomy to set targets as part of their transition plans, which is helping them access finance, finance that we could call transition finance.
2. Financial market participants, financial institutions and even other stakeholders are also starting to use the Taxonomy and the wider sustainable finance framework as part of their lending strategies, product development, engagement practices and net-zero planning. For the Taxonomy cannot be disassociated from financial and transition planning.
 
Setting capex-alignment targets and developing capex plans in line with the Taxonomy is the DNA of a credible transition plan - alongside absolute GHG emissions reduction targets in line with 1.5 degrees.

The market practices shared with us by practitioners have been most informative. They have helped us to understand where the different stakeholders are, and the extent to which the framework is ‚Äúusable‚Äù as of today (and its potential). But also, where the challenges are.  

We have listened carefully to both the financial and the non-financial industry and we have readjusted our priorities in response to the most pressing issues they face.  This is why the report lists upfront the priorities for the EU Platform to work on until the end of its mandate. To find out what these are, please take a look at pages 10 to 13 of the report that can be found at https://lnkd.in/deeUX_t5


Watch the webinar recording with presentations by Elodie Feller  Cl√©mence Humeau, EU Platform on Sustainable Finance  subgroup on data and usability co-rapporteurs, who led the work on the report; and a panel discussion by members of the group, and closing remarks by Martin ≈†polc  from the European Commission
