Abstract
Spaesati d’Italia: Emigration in Italian National Identity Construction from Postwar to
Economic Miracle

Since the founding of the Italian nation in 1861, mass emigration has played a crucial role
in the construction of a national identity among a population historically divided by
regional, ethnic, linguistic and cultural differences. In the aftermath of the Second World
War, emigration continued to fulfill a vital function in Italy’s national redefinition. In
material terms, it enabled Italy to rebuild a devastated political and economic framework
in a manner that allowed old power blocs to evade the restructuring of traditional
relations of production.
Yet emigration proved equally essential for redrawing the cognitive map of the nation,
laying out the new ideological terrain upon which material reconstruction was to take
place. In the ideological vacuum that followed the collapse of Fascism and the nation’s
loss of foreign colonies, postwar emigration narratives proved fundamental for carrying
out a project of collective redemption that cleansed Italians from the stain of Fascism
while restoring the colonial imaginary that had traditionally governed the nation’s
relationship with its South. By supplying at once absolution for past sins and an archaic
internal Other against which the new nation could measure itself, postwar representations
of emigration helped pave the way for Italy’s transformation into a “modern,” post-
Fascist democracy, a founder of the European Union, and one of the world’s leading
economies.
This dissertation examines emigration narratives produced in literary and filmic texts
spanning from 1945 to 1964 in works by key figures of Italian postwar culture such as
Carlo Levi, Ignazio Silone, Rocco Scotellaro, Mario Soldati, Aldo Fabrizi, Luchino
Visconti, and Pier Paolo Pasolini. By examining shifting forms of interdiction that placed
migrant Others outside the moral, spatial and temporal boundaries of the nation, this
research aims to illustrate how the emigrants’ textual presence gave shape and meaning
to the new nation, bringing into focus the contours of a new republic emerging from the
ashes of Fascism.

INTRODUCTION
Criminal anthropologist Cesare Lombroso once observed that “emigration is the
only resource that allows us to sadly govern Italy.”
1
 This confession, which appeared in
the 1898 edition ofIn Calabria, formed a strident contrast with Lombroso’s negligible
treatment of emigration in the original 1862 text, where emigration was barely
mentioned, and only as evidence of the South’s deviance with respect to the rest of the
nation. Lombroso’s about-face on the importance of emigration in Italian national affairs
provides an insight into the increasingly powerful role that emigration came to play in
shaping the Italian national imaginary after the formation of Italy as a nation-state in
1861. Emigration did indeed prove essential for “governing” Italy, as Lombroso claimed,
but in a double sense, for while it constituted a major factor guiding the nation’s political
and economic choices for over a century, it also, and perhaps especially, provided the sort
of figurative material that “governed” how the Italian nation was imagined at home and
abroad.
In 2003, Donna Gabaccia wrote that “without Italians, or an Italian nation, it is
difficult to write with much confidence about an Italian diaspora.”
2
 While her claim
intended, quite justifiably, to shed light on the problem of searching for a unified,
homogenous diaspora in Italian emigration history, the aim of my research originates
from the reversal of this perspective, setting out to illustrate how without an Italian
diaspora it would have been difficult to speak of Italians or of an Italian nation, since the
representation of emigration has been one of the major grounds upon which the Italian
nation has been articulated.
The important ideological function served by emigration narratives is not
surprising, given that the phenomenon of mass emigration has been so fundamental an
aspect of modern Italian culture and society. Historically, Italian emigration has exceeded
that of any other country in recorded world history, including that of Britain and China.
3
Between 1876 and 1988, 27 million Italians emigrated – a staggering number if one

considers that this was the entire population of Italy in 1871 and half of its current
population.
4
 If we consider the additional 4 to 9 million
5
 who migrated internally, from
southern to northern Italy, during the 1950s and 1960s, post-World War II emigration
alone constitutes approximately 40% of the Italian emigration phenomenon. Yet
scholarly attention has tended to privilege the turn-of-the-century period
6
, a limit which
in part explains why it isla grande emigrazione (“the great emigration”) that remains so
dominant in Italian recollection while the far more recent experience remains much more
elusive in collective memory.
The tendency to ignore or minimize the extreme recentness of the phenomenon
springs from the long-standing view, in Italy, of emigration as an affront to national
pride, a belief with roots sinking back to the beginnings of mass emigration – and of the
nation itself – in Italian history. On the one hand, emigration was perceived as a
necessary evil, an ideal “release valve” that allowed Italy to eschew the threat of social
unrest posed by chronic unemployment and poverty, especially in the South. This
position was embodied by Francesco Saverio Nitti, a southern economist, journalist and
politician. Nitti’s first text, written in 1888, when he was twenty years old, synthesized
the pro-emigrationist viewpoint, arguing that to suppress or limit emigration was cruel
and unjust, since the poverty of the South relegated it to a sad and fatal alternative:o
emigranti o briganti (“either emigrants or brigands”).
7
 On the other hand, mass
emigration also provoked feelings of enormous embarrassment. For the leaders of a
young nation struggling to project an image of economic and colonial prowess on par
with other European powers, mass emigration provided rather damning evidence of a pre-
industrial economy, eliciting the dictum, so offensive to the colonial ambitions of the
Liberal and Fascist states, that Italian emigration constituted a form ofcolonialismo
straccione (“beggar colonialism”). This position, which guided Italian emigration policy
until the end of the Second World War, was upheld by nationalists like the writer and
politician Enrico Corradini and the poet Giovanni Pascoli, both of whom argued for the
necessity to turn Italy’s emigrant masses, scattered across the globe, into a colonizing
force in Africa.

 Figures vary according to whether they reflect only “official” changes of residence, which were
far fewer than “illegal” internal migrations due to a Fascist anti-urbanization law that remained in effect
until the 1960s, as discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3.

v
This ambivalence towards the issue of emigration was not overcome by the time
mass emigration resumed after the Second World War. The general tendency at the
institutional level was to keep the migration flow out of public view
9
, yet such intentions
could hardly have met with success, given that the Italian government not only
vigorously encouraged emigration, but, for the first time in history, officially
administered it through an extensive “assisted emigration” program. Moreover, the
exodus of Italian laborers northward after the war assumed such massive proportions that
it could not but reveal, at home as abroad, the inadequacies of Italian economic policy
even at the height of (and as late as) the economic miracle. The preservation of a colonial
model of exploitation that relied on producing and maintaining regional disparities
ensured a vast reservoir of cheap labor that northern Italian industry was only in part
capable of absorbing. While elsewhere in Europe a vastly expanding economy created a
demand for imported labor, Italy’s chagrined response to its unemployed masses was,
once again, emigration. As the countrysides emptied, the decrease in population and the
influx of emigrants’ remittances home were fundamental to producing the rise in
consumption patterns characteristic of the economic miracle. Thus, the “great shame” of
emigration ensured that even as emigration played such a central role in the political and
economic reconstruction of Italy, its representation in the cultural sphere remained
disproportionately minor. However, an analysis of certain literary and filmic works will
demonstrate that even from its posit ion on the fringes of nat ional culture, emigration
continued to exercise enormous power in the “making of Italy” throughout the 1950s and
1960s.
In the historiography of certain countries of immigration, such as the United
States, Canada and Australia, the cultural significance of migration in nation-building has
been studied, offering accounts of the racialization of immigrants as part of a broader
project to forge a national identity. Joseph Pugliese, for instance, has examined how the
screening of southern Italian immigrants during the “White Australia Policy” was a
significant aspect of Australia’s practices of racialization in the 1960s.
10
 In the context of
the United States, Joseph Cosco has analyzed the writings of American novelists and
immigration journalists to narrate the “racial odyssey” of Italian immigrants to the United
States, demonstrating how American representations of Italians impacted America’s
racialized national identity at the turn of the twentieth century.
11
Scholarship on Italian emigration has thus contributed significantly to national
histories outside of Italy, focusing on the role of Italian immigration in the construction
of the “host” nation. Because the United States was the chief destination of Italian
emigrants before World War I, most accounts of Italian immigration to the U.S. focus on
the turn of the twentieth century, while Australian historiography on the subject has
tended to concentrate on the postwar period since the bulk of Italian emigration there did
not occur until after the Second World War.

In addit ion to contribut ing to various nat ional histories, Italian emigrat ion
scholarship has also abounded with accounts of emigrants’ experiences in building ethnic
communities abroad. Representative texts of this area of inquiry are, to name but a few,
Gastaldoet al. (1994),The Columbus People: Perspectives in Italian Immigration to the
Americas and Australia, John Zucchi’sItalians in Toronto: Development of a National
Identity 1875-1935 (1988), Nicholas Harney’sEh, Paesan! Being Italian in Toronto
(1998), and the numerous contributions made toItalian Americana, a cultural and
historical review dedicated to the Italian experience in America. Related to this field of
inquiry are analyses of the formation of a national identity among Italian expatriates, with
considerable attention devoted to the attempts made by the Fascist state to “fascistize”
Italian communities abroad during the 1920s and 1930s. This research is represented in
texts like Gianfranco Cresciani’sFascism, Anti-Fascism and the Italians in Australia,
1922-1945 (1980), Luigi Bruti-Liberati’sIl Canada, l’Italia e il Fascismo 1818-1945
(1984), and Luconi and Tintori’sL’ombra lunga del fascio: canali di propaganda
fascista per gli “italiani d’America” (2004).
More recently, scholarship on Italian emigration has favored a transnational
perspective that extends the implications of migration beyond national borders. In
Emigrant Nation, Mark Choate interprets Italian emigration from national unification to
the First World War in relation to Italy’s colonial ambitions, placing Italian emigration in
dialogue with the nation’s imperial program of “demographic colonialism.” His work
details Italy’s attempts to create a “Greater Italy,” a sort of emigrant empire that, by
fostering common banking, education and religious programs, cultivated a shared sense
ofitalianità (Italianness) among emigrant communities abroad.
The transnational turn has placed Italian migration scholarship within the larger
field of diaspora studies. The term “diaspora,” which comes from the Greekspeiro (to
sow) and the prepositiondia (over), essentially means a scattering of people. The ancient
Greeks in fact used the term to signify migration or colonization. In his pioneering work
on diasporas, Robin Cohen
13
 has ident ified various categories o f diasporic co mmunit ies.
Victim diasporas, the most well-known, are those of forcibly displaced peoples, such as
Jews, Africans, and Armenians. Imperial diasporas, on the other hand, were formed by
the overseas settlements of citizens of imperial powers, exemplified by the British and
Portuguese. This kind of diaspora is also known as “settler colonialism.” Because Italian
emigrants were neither forcibly removed nor elite members of a colonial society (outside
of their colonies in Libya and East Africa, that is) they can perhaps be considered to fit,
albeit imperfectly, within the category of “trade diasporas,” which Cohen defines as
“networks of proactive merchants who transport, buy and sell their goods over long
distances,”
14
 if by “goods” we may also consider emigrant labor. However, this
categorization also proves somewhat unsatisfactory, for trade diasporas suggest degrees
of freedom and affluence typically absent in the experiences of first-generation
emigrants.
This is not the only aspect troubling the placement of Italian emigration within
diaspora studies, however. Perhaps an even greater problem is raised by the existence
among diasporas of a bond with a real or imagined homeland claiming the migrants’
loyalty and emotions. Indeed, the diasporas’ relationship to the adopted country is often
13

complicated by the migrants’ “acceptance of an inescapable link with their past migration
history and a sense of co-ethnicity with others of a similar background.”
15
 It is precisely
this inescapable link among migrants and between their communities and the home
country that problematizes the classification of Italian migration as a form of diaspora. In
Italy’s Many Diasporas, Donna Gabaccia has contested the existence of a widespread and
unifying sense of Italianness that would have tied Italian emigrants to a larger, abstract
community such as that of the nation. Arguing that Italians’ regional divisions and their
sense ofcampanilismo, or localized belongingness, predominated in their cultural
practices long after their separation from the “mother country,” Gabaccia proposes
thinking about Italian emigration, as the title of her work suggests, as “many diasporas.”
The conclusion reached by her study is that the experience of emigration ultimately did
not foster the formation of a national identity among Italian expatriates, whose identities
were instead shaped by much stronger local and regional ties to their places of origin,
thereby contributing to the formation of a multiplicity of diasporas.
In Italy, emigration historiography has tended to privilege empirical rather than
hermeneutic methodologies. Major works on Italian emigration, such as the impressive
Storia dell’emigrazione italiana edited by Bevilacqua and others, but also smaller
volumes like Ercole Sori’sL’emigrazione italiana dall’Unità alla seconda guerra
mondiale, Ugo Ascoli’sMovimenti migratori in Italia, Enrico Pugliese’sL’Italia tra
migrazioni internazionali e migrazioni interne, or Michele Colucci’sLavoro in
movimento, to name but a few,offer essentially quantitative accounts and policy analyses
of Italian emigration, often focusing on the social and economic import of the
phenomenon and usually stopping at the Second World War. Unfortunately, the
invaluable information provided in such studies has not been accompanied by a
correspondingly vast body of research capable of explaining the cultural and ideological
import of Italian emigration. While some studies have provided surveys of literary and
filmic representations of emigration, they typically fail to delve below the surface to
examine how emigration narratives may have contributed to the figurative creation of the
Italian nation. What has been largely absent in scholarship on Italian emigration, in other
words, is an engagement with the relationship between the migrant figure and the Italian
nation, an interpretive approach capable of discerning the contributions made by Italian
emigration narratives to the ideological mechanisms through which the Italian nation was
produced.
WithSpaesati d’Italia, I have attempted to illustrate how Italian cultural texts
manufactured differences in the Italian diaspora through the erection of moral, temporal
and spatial boundaries that rendered the country’s reconstitution in the postwar era as a
modern and prosperous democracy more visible. It is with considerable caution, however,
that I use the term “diaspora” here. Strictly speaking, this dissertation is not a study of
Italian diaspora(s). In examining Italian postwar migration, I do not follow, so to speak,
the emigrants to their adopted communities to examine their efforts to integrate in the
host country or to recover a sense ofitalianità (“Italianness”). My analysis focuses
instead on the figurative construction of Italian emigrants and interrogates how their
movements, enunciations and displacements in Italian postwar texts acted upon the
(re)construction of a national imaginary in Italy itself. Due to the metaphorical function
of such representations, portrayals of Italian emigrants functioned as a kind of self-
15

portrait for the nation as a whole. Rather than examine the repercussions of migration
upon the emigrants themselves, therefore, I analyze how strategies employed by
emigration narratives gave shape to the idea that Italians had of their nation in a decisive
moment of Italian political and cultural refashioning.
The figurative construction of all nations involves a proliferation of discourses
and an intensification of intellectual activity. The theory ofhegemony which Italian
Marxist Antonio Gramsci developed in hisPrison Notebooks can help to shed light on
how national identities are cultivated. The concept of hegemony served to describe how
one social group or idea achieved and maintained dominance over others through
ideological rather than coercive means. Gramsci defined hegemony as “the ‘spontaneous’
consent given by the great masses of the population to the general direction imposed on
social life by the dominant fundamental group; this consent is ‘historically’ caused by the
prestige (and consequent confidence) which the dominant group enjoys because of its
position and function in the world of production”
16
 Throughout theNotebooks, Gramsci
often uses the termdirezione(direction, leadership), and more specifically “intellectual
and moral leadership,”
17
 as a substitute for hegemony to correlate the concept more
clearly with a complex cultural elaboration that Roger Simon has termed “the
organization of consent.”
18
 The importance of hegemony theory lies in having established
the crucial role of culture not only for achieving and maintaining political power but also
for shaping any form of collective identity, such as that of the nation, through the use of
ideological constructs.
Europe’s passage to modernity was marked by the demise of feudal systems of
government based on inherited or “divine” authority and the rise of (at least nominally)
democratic forms of state power based on popular consent, thus establishing the
dependence of modern forms of life upon the function of ideological mechanisms. As
John McLeod has explained, “These novel forms of government and power required new
myths to sustain their legitimacy, and it is here that the [...] image of the nation emerged
as a potent idea, aligning the subjectivity and psychology of individuals with the sense of
belonging to a common people, in whose shared interests the nation-state appeared to
function.”
19
French Orientalist, Ernest Renan delivered an historic lecture at the Sorbonne in
1882 titled “What is a Nation?” Though Renan considered the nation from the
perspective of historic fact, meaning that he focused on the nation “as state,” as the
product of a succession of conquests and laws, he nonetheless centered on the novel
ideological character of nations, foregrounding the role of “consent”:
A nation is a soul, a spiritual principle. Two things, which in truth are but one,
constitute this soul or spiritual principle. One lies in the past, one in the present.
One is the possession in common of a rich legacy of memories; the other is
present-day consent, the desire to live together, the will to perpetuate the value of
the heritage that one has received in an undivided form. [....] A nation is therefore

a large-scale solidarity, constituted by the feeling of the sacrifices that one has
made in the past and of those that one is prepared to make in the future. It
presupposes a past; it is summarized, however, in the present by a tangible fact,
namely, consent, the clearly expressed desire to continue a common life.
20
Cultural media such as music, literature and then cinema thus became essential for
constructing the legitimacy of the nation. Precisely because the nation is, as Benedict
Anderson observed, an “imagined community,”
21
 in the sense that we do not know all the
members belonging to this community and must therefore imagine our connection to the
nation, it relies heavily on the narratives produced through cultural channels. For this
reason, there is an intimate relationship between the nation and cultural productions, for
in the words of David Forgacs, “the media do not reflect or articulate the identity of a
pre-existing national community but are one of the means, maybe even the principal one,
by which that community and its identity are brought into being and shaped and later
(perhaps) eroded.”
22
Part of the “fiction” of the nation lies in its apparent lack of contradictions, its
exhibition of “natural” unity and universality in the face of the constant challenges posed
by ethnic, linguistic, religious and other differences that threaten to tear the nation
asunder and thus render it a deeply unstable formation. As Ashcroft, Griffiths and Tiffin
point out, “the instability of the nation is the inevitable consequence of its nature as a
social construction. This myth of nationhood, masked by ideology, perpetuates
nationalism, in which specific identifiers are employed to create exclusive and
homogeneous conceptions of national traditions. Such signifiers of homogeneity always
fail to represent the diversity of the actual ‘national’ community for which they purport to
speak, and, in practice, usually represent and consolidate the interests of the dominant
power groups within any national formation.”
23
 The nation thus tends to be represented as
a “finite space” that includes certain kinds of subjects but not others.
24
Needless to say, in the Italian case mass emigration problematized the nation’s
project to coat itself with an ideology of homogeneity and stability. The paradox posed
by migration was that while the Italian population scattered, especially subaltern groups
deemed dangerous or otherwise undesirable to the nation, the cultural representations of
this diaspora set out to put back together in virtual form precisely that national cohesion
that had been preempted by mass emigration. Such representations sought to (re)create a
unified, coherent national whole precisely by recasting the emigrant as an Other who was
placed outside of the spatial and temporal confines of the nation and whose movements
across these could be controlled or manipulated in a manner that invested them with
meaning by and for the nation. As a result, representations of emigration served to create
the ideological glue for a perennially elusive sense of national cohesion.

The migrant figure thus plays a fundamental role in the formation of a national
identity. According to Zygmunt Bauman, the very essence of identity formation was to be
found in the journey of the migrant’s “I” toward the ideal “I” of a perpetually distant
destination.
 25
 Bauman’s point suggests that “identity” is more a process involving
performance and representation than ana priori state of being that holds intrinsic,
authentic value. Identity, in other words, does not transcend history but can be seen to
develop within the discursive practices of national formations. As such, it is inseparable
from theform of the nation taken on by modernity. Indeed, the passage from inherited to
acquired identit y, more than the nat ionper se, may be considered to be modernity’s most
distinctive materialization, for in order to perform and represent itself, the nation state
depends on a stable, fixed identity, and proceeds discursively to create it as a natural,
original state of being. Those forms of identity that do not fit within the nation’s project
to create a homogenous order, such as migrants and other subaltern groups, Bauman
defines with the metaphor of “the stranger.” Strangers are “the people who do not fit the
cognitive, moral, or aesthetic map of the world,” he explains; “they befog and eclipse the
boundary lines which ought to be clearly seen; if, having done all this, they gestate
uncertainty, which in its turn breeds discomfort of feeling lost – then each society
produces such strangers, while drawing its borders and charting its cognitive, aesthetic
and moral map.”
26
 Historically, the formation of the nation state, with its requirement to
build order, has meant that “certain inhabitants of the territory to be made orderly in the
new way turn into strangers that need to be eliminated.”
27
 Strangers thus live “in a state
of suspended extinction [...] their presence [...] defined a priori as temporary.”
28
In a vicious circle, the Other created by the nation’s project to construct a
homogenous unity becomes a specter who justifies the raising of boundaries and the
patrolling of borders in an attempt to seal in the nation, a figurative “circling of the
wagons”
29
 that seeks to preserve the laboriously constructed integrity of the national
subject, until the stranger becomes someone “who makes you think you are at home.”
30
So powerful has the role of the migrant Other been in the Italian construction of national
space that it is reflected in the language itself, for in Italian the migrant’s ambiguity and
nationlessness are combined in the single termspaesamento, which signifies both a
general confusional state and the condition of being without apaese, or country. This
outsider figure insinuates itself into the coziness of the nation, depriving it of the
reassurances of familiarity, isolation, and safety. The production of the nation thus
embodies this paradox: while the Other is created in order to displace and exclude
whatever diversity or uncertainty may call into question the nation’s order, it must also be
continually articulated, called forth and made to appear in the very same location as the
nation so that it may define its contours.

With its reliance on binary oppositions like insider/outsider or (European)
self/Other, the construction of the nation brings us inevitably to the issue of the colonial
subject who traditionally has formed the nation’s most consistent Other. The emergence
of the nation state did not just “coincide” with the practice of colonialism but was joined
indissolubly with it, both emerging with the rise of capitalism and European
industrialization from the sixteenth century onwards.
31
 As Timothy Brennan put it,
Even though [nationalism] as an ideology ... came out of the imperialist
countries, these countries were not able to formulate their own national
aspirations until the age of exploration. The markets made possible by European
imperial penetration motivated the construction of the nation-state at home.
European nationalism was motivated by what Europe was doing in its far-flung
dominions. The ‘national idea’, in other words, flourished in the soil of foreign
conquest.
32
European colonizers thus did not “discover” so much ascreate the colonial Other as an
object whose very alterity validated the stability and fixity of their own national
identities. The nation state can thus be considered to be derivative of colonialism insofar
as it became materially and ideologically caught up in the creation of a colonial Other, a
relationship that prompted Frantz Fanon to claim once that Europe was “literally the
creation of the Third World.”
33
The intimate relationship between national format ion and colonialism has placed
postcolonial theory at the center of cultural studies inquiries of national identity. It is of
course to Edward Said’s foundational text,Orientalism, that we owe a fully-developed
thesis of the mutually const itutive relat ionship between European nat ional identit ies
(particularly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries) and their colonial Other. After
Foucault’s work on the power/knowledge nexus, Said illustrated how the “knowledge”
produced and circulated in Europe about “the Orient” was an instrument of power that
accompanied the conquest and exercise of colonial rule over the “Near East.” The
“Orient” produced in this discourse did not exist as a real place but was a representation
of the colonial Other that served to give contour, through negation, to the European
national subject. This is what Said intended when he claimed that the Orient was an
invention by and for Europe.
Within the European context, nowhere is the reliance of the national subject upon
the construction of a (colonial) Other more evident than in the case of Italy, where
national unification in 1861 resulted in a form of colonial rule over the South and the
production of a discursive field (the so-called “Southern Question”) that, through various
disciplines, consistently produced the alterity of the southern population. So germane is
Said’s work to the Italian context that some scholars have referred to it as “Orientalism in
one country.”
34
 Much like the “Orient” had been for the “West,” the South became the
foil against which to define a new, northern dominated nation anxious to measure up to
the great powers of Europe. And like the Orient to which it was constantly likened, the

xii
South ceased to be a real, geographical place in and of itself and became a discursive
locus for the construction of the Italian national imaginary. To paraphrase Said, the
“South” became almost a northern invention. Echoing contemporaneous discourses in
France and England with respect to their colonies, Italy’s discourse on the South proved
powerfully formative for its national identity and particularly expedient for the
colonization of the South. As a brief example, let us recall the aforementioned text by
Cesare Lombroso,In Calabria. When Lombroso wrote it in 1862, the occasion for his
visit to Calabria was his conscription in the Piedmontese army that had been dispatched
to the South to squash “brigandage” in the immediate aftermath of national unification.
As part of this campaign to annex the South to the new Italian nation, tens of thousands
of “brigands” and their collaborators were killed, imprisoned, tortured, and exiled.
35
Incredibly, Lombroso, then a young doctor, never mentions the violence and injuries
inflicted by his army upon the civilian population, yet he minutely records all the
illnesses and weaknesses of the Calabrians, including hysteria, syphilis and rampant
cretinism (even in dogs). The careful, “scientific” measurement of the southern
population’s physical and moral degeneracy was to become the life work of Lombroso
and scores of his fellow social scientists who, in the act of producing the South, were also
creating a “civilized,” non-South Italian nation.
When Italian mass emigration took a distinctively southern turn in the last decade
of the nineteenth century, with the majority of migrants originating from southern
regions, the discourse on the Southern Question replicated itself in thequestione
dell’emigrazione, or the “emigrant question.” In literary and filmic representations,
emigrants were cast as internal Others whose movements across the spatial and temporal
boundaries beyond which this discourse had relegated them begins to threaten the illusory
stability and homogeneity of Italian national culture. This is all the more true for
emigration narratives produced in the aftermath of the Second World War, when the
spread of decolonization movements around the world, including former Italian colonies,
threatened to affect Italy’s internal colonial situation. Given this context, representations
of emigration in the postwar era bore an even more urgent task in the re-construction of
the Italian nation. Considering all that was at stake, the migrant figures produced in
postwar narratives of the nation held an infinitely more complex function than ever
before, for it was no longer sufficient simply to confirm, once again, the superior/inferior
or modern/archaic oppositions: emigrant figures were invested with the task of rebuilding
Italy’s identity as a post-Fascist, modern, capitalist, democratic nation within the new
geography of power of the European Community and its economic market.
.      One of the traditional figurative strategies for Otherizing emigrants was that of
temporal displacement, in which emigrants were placed outside the time of the nation. In
Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes its Object, Johannes Fabian pursues the
question of how certain bodies of knowledge are validated through the use of temporal
categorizations. While Fabian focuses on the field of anthropology, the same ideological
process may be said to be at work in other fields of social inquiry and cultural
representations. In such bodies of knowledge, Fabian argues, the use of Time “is made
35
 See Pino Aprile,Terroni. Tutto quello che è stato fatto perché gli italiani del Sud diventassero
“meridionali” (Milano: Edizioni Piemme, 2010).

xiii
for the purpose of distancing those who are observed from the Time of the observer.”
36
The researching subject’s temporal displacement of the Other entails the construction of a
kind of Time that Fabian callsMundane orTypological Time, present in descriptions of a
culture or society as “archaic,” “primitive,” “savage,” “backward,” and in the use of
adjectives such as “mythical,” “ritual,” “tribal,” and so on. This “denial of coevalness,” as
Fabian calls it, amounts to “apersistent and systematic tendency to place the referent(s)
[...] in a Time other than the present of the producer of [...] discourse.”
37
While Said’s and Fabian’s theories have proved invaluable for understanding how
the production of alterity has served to create and bolster national identity, I have also
found it necessary to reach beyond them to examine the complex dynamics emigrant
figures have set in motion. While fundamental for identifying mechanisms of oppression,
Said’s theory also seems to leave important questions about the agency of the subaltern
unanswered, in that the action of constituting the Other tends to be unidirectional, with
the object of study serving merely as a passive recipient of Western colonial
constructions. In the literary texts Said examines, an Oriental figure is created “by and
for” Europe but is never shown to respond or to have apresence in the text, that
disturbing, disquieting position that motivated the Western need to eliminate it in the first
place. The work of Homi Bhabha proves particularly helpful in this respect. While he
looks to Said as having “inaugurated the postcolonial field,”
38
 Bhabha nonetheless
revised Said’s more monolithic history of colonialism to allow the colonized the
possibility of agency. Extending Said’s practice of reading against-the-grain of colonial
texts, Bhabha identifies unintended “slippages” and “excesses” which, reappropriated and
reinscribed by the colonized, constitute “a native refusal to satisfy the colonizer’s
demand.”
39
 Because the Other is continually called forth in colonial texts, Bhabha argues,
it constitutes an unsettling “partial presence” that disrupts the “writing” of the nation, and
thus of itself as Other. Such texts are therefore mined from the outset by the
“ambivalence” of colonial discourse: the Other who must be present to lend the colonizer
authority at the same time constitutes a menace, because “in disclosing the ambivalence
of colonial discourse [it] also disrupts its authority.”
40
 In a radical move, Bhabha turns the
ambivalence of colonialist texts against colonial authority, opening up a space for
resistance with “a form of subversion, founded on that uncertainty, that turns the
discursive conditions of dominance into the grounds of intervention.”
41
Bhabha’s more dynamic interpretation of the Other proves particularly fruitful for
examining how emigration narratives helped to produce the Italian nation. InNation and
Narration, Bhabha identifies “a particular ambivalence that haunts the idea of the
nation,”
42
 and suggests that it is against the margins of national space and time, where the
emigrant Other has been displaced, that the nation is textually produced. There where the

nation is written, he argues, we do not move upon stable, homogenous ground but are
always confronted with the problem of disjunction and hybridity. Though it has been
circumscribed by boundaries and cleared of dissonant Others, the space of the nation is
nonetheless made vulnerable precisely by those limits, haunted as it is by the specter of
those it has marginalized, who threaten to return and disrupt its writing. Since
representing the nation requires the setting of limits and boundaries, it is in such in-
between, marginal spaces that the act of writing the nation takes place. Hence the practice
of  critically “reading” national space becomes an issue of identifying and elaborating
upon sites of exclusion and struggle.
In Italian postwar emigration narratives, emigrants can be seen as “interstitial
determiners” of nationhood: in the descriptions of their incursions across the temporal,
spatial and moral borders of the nation we can see the topography of a new, modern
Republic being born. In Chapter 1 I examine how Carlo Levi’s 1945 literary masterpiece,
Cristo si e` fermato a Eboli (Christ Stopped at Eboli), contributed to redefining Italian
national identity in a critical moment of Italian history that was marked by the collapse of
the Fascist regime, world war, civil war, the liberation and foreign occupation of the
South, and the loss of Italy’s foreign colonies. In his autobiographical account of exile in
the southern region of Lucania, Levi reinforced the imaginary boundary separating the
nation from its internal colonial Other. My analysis ofCristo si è fermato a Eboli pays
close attention to the literary devices Levi employed, including the appropriation of
certain writings by Ignazio Silone and Rocco Scotellaro, to handle the predicament of
emigration across the nation’s liminal space of interdiction, thereby reclaiming the
authority of colonial discourse.
Chapter 2 reinterprets Italy’s postwar reconstruction as an ideological  problem
that was addressed through interpretations of the recent past capable of absolving Italy’s
support of Fascism. The figure of the emigrant, once so disparaged, was revisited and
invested with the task of redeeming the corrupt nation by crossing and defining the moral
frontiers of the new Republic. Italian cinematic neorealism proved instrumental in this
national reconstruction, as my analyses of Mario Soldati’sFuga in Francia (1948) and
Aldo Fabrizi’sEmigrantes (1949) illustrates. In these representations, the problem of
how the South was to be integrated in the national whole was omitted altogether to favor
a portrayal of popular unity at least formally evocative of the ideals of the Resistance.
In the third and final chapter I examine the identity crisis caused by internal
migration during the transformative years of the “economic miracle.” As the urban
centers of the industrialized north and of the capital city were resignified asloci of
neocapitalist expansion, southern emigrants were displaced once more outside new
boundaries of space and time. The nation’s progress and affluence came to be defined by
the emigrants’  physical segregation outside these urban centers and their temporal
displacement from modern society. The imaginary archive of Italy’s economic miracle
was enriched by influential sociological treatises describing the “Koreas” (ghettos) the
emigrants inhabited and the “primitive” “amoral familism” in which their culture was
supposedly steeped. Cinematic masterpieces, such as Luchino Visconti’sRocco e i suoi
fratelli (1960) and Pier Paolo Pasolini’sAccattone (1961), provided the master narratives
of the emigrants’ experiences of marginalization, ultimately reaching very different
conclusions about internal migration that ranged from its embodiment of a Gramscian
national-popular unity to its constituting a case of cultural genocide.

CHAPTER 1
IMMURING THE COLONY IN CARLO LEVI’SCRISTO SI E`
 FERMATO A EBOLI
In the aftermath of the Second World War, Italy was involved in an extensive
reconstruction effort that affected not only the material and political aspects of national
life but also the cultural sphere made up of ideas, values, and identities. Italy’s defeat in
the war, the collapse of Fascism, the loss of its colonial empire all coalesced to create a
moral and ideological devastation that equaled the material destruction of the war. In this
atmosphere of radical indeterminacy, the reconstruction of national identity proceeded
along a dialectic marked by the opening up of new possibilities on the one hand and the
entrenchment of conservative positions on the other. One of the primary fronts of this
confrontation was the time-honored discursive field of the Southern Question. The ritual
question of “what is to be done about the South,” now complicated by mass emigration,
reclaimed urgency as Italy, in the process of losing its colonies abroad, returned its self-
reflective gaze inward to its oldest, “unofficial” colony. This chapter will examine how
Carlo Levi’s literary masterpiece,Cristo si e` fermato a Eboli (Christ Stopped at Eboli)
(1945), contributed to redefining Italian national identity in this critical historical moment
by reinforcing the imaginary boundary separating the nation from its internal colonial
double. This analysis will pay particular attention to the literary devices Levi employed,
including the appropriation of certain postcolonial writings by Ignazio Silone and Rocco
Scotellaro, to handle the predicament of emigration across this liminal space of
interdiction, thereby reclaiming the authority of colonial discourse.
Carlo Levi’sCristo si è fermato a Eboli
Carlo Levi was born in 1902 in Turin, the capital of Piedmont, the region that had
“annexed” the South in 1860 and had been the seat of the ruling Savoy dynasty. His
father was a wealthy physician and his mother was the sister of famous journalist and
Socialist leader Claudio Treves. Levi received the classic education enjoyed by members
of the Piemontese upper bourgeoisie. At the University of Turin he became friends with
the radical liberal Piero Gobetti, who first introduced him to political activism.

receiving a degree in medicine, he went on to Paris for a specialization, though he would
never practice medicine, preferring to dedicate himself to painting and writing. While in
Paris, he frequented notable personalities like Giorgio de Chirico, Igor Stravinsky and
Alberto Moravia. In 1929 he founded an anti-fascist movement calledGiustizia e
Liberta` (Justice and Liberty), and it was for his anti-fascist activities in connection with
this movement that he was arrested by Fascist authorities and exiled, or sent toconfino

 Carlo Levi continued to
paint and write throughout his life, in addition to pursuing a political career from the
1960s onward. However, his enormous fame and influence is attributable toCristo si e`
fermato a Eboli, which rendered him a giant of twent ieth-century literature in Italy and
beyond.
5
Written between 1943 and 1944,Cristo si e` fermato a Eboli
6
 is a retrospective
autobiographical account of Carlo Levi’s exile. The point of view was of course that of a
foreigner who had furthermore been sent to Lucania against his will. What was more, its
author’s moral, political and aesthetic views had been formed within a cultural milieu that
historically had taken for granted and reproduced a version of the South as a colonial
subject with no sovereignty.  The novel’s reproposal of the familiartopos of the South
and its dramatic account narrated in “realistic,” accessible prose earned it such enormous
success that to this day, the nameLucania hardly conjures a place at all different from the
mysterious, closed-off universe Levi described. The importance of Levi’s novel lies in its
construed impartiality in denouncing the ills of the Italian South, chief among which were
the dire poverty of the peasantry living in tight, malaria-infested quarters, and the
impoverishment of the petty bourgeoisie whose hatred for the peasantry impeded the
cultural and material modernization of the region.
The damage wrought by Levi’s beautiful novel lies partly in its alleged
objectivity; though it was not part of the political discourse on the South, it had
undeniable political implications, for Levi’s novel was read and referenced in spheres far
afield of literary circles to impute a persistent “backwardness” in the South

Confino was a form of imprisonment commonly used by the Fascist government against political
prisoners that combined exile with house arrest. The term itself refers to a “boundary” beyond which the
prisoner was ostracized.

 The real name of the town is Aliano, but Levi changed its name to Gagliano in the novel.

 The influence ofCristo si e` fermato a Eboli in the United States was so enormous that,
according to Anna Maria Torriglia, it was the most widely read work of modern Italian literature before the
publication of Tomasi di Lampedusa’sIl gattopardo (1958) and Luigi Branzini’sThe Italians (1964). Anna

justifying prolonged colonial rule over it. Moreover, the very fact of its “literariness”
testifies to the deep-seatedness of colonial thinking with regards to the South. The
tremendous popularity of Levi’s novel, and the familiarity of the discourse on the South
on which it relied, contributed to a general tendency to take for granted its author’s
reliability as a disinterested, unbiased observer. However, rather than an autobiographical
account describing an actual place or people, Levi’s masterpiece more closely resembles
a fantastic tale in which creatures only half human inhabit a magical other-world existing
outside the bounds of the modern space and time of the Italian nation.
8
 Levi’s
denunciation of the misery of the peasants was not backed by any historical inquiry, for
he did not explainwhy the peasants were oppressed with such poverty and injustice, just
as he devoted no attention to the fundamental division of labor, at the heart of the South’s
“backwardness,” splitting the Italian peninsula into industrialism on one end and ruralism
on the other.
9
Along with little else, Levi arrived in Lucania with a cumbersome set of
preconceptions gathered from the dominant discourse on the South. Indeed, Levi never
even questioned that most, if not all, “exile” locations were in the South, which testifies
both to its perception as lying “outside” national space and to its status as an undesirable
South’ and the Earth-Wise Folk Who Dwell There.”New York Times Book Review, 20 April, 1947
(emphasis added). Subsequently, in various articles that Levi authored for theNew York Times between
1947 and 1949, he was cast as an expert on the Italian South, and his writings were invested with the same
authority granted to sociological and anthropological studies. See his “Peasants Stir in Groping Italy,”New
York Times, 14 September 1947, SM18; and “Eboli Revisited: New Life Stirs,”New York Times, 13 March
1947, SM12. In the wake of Levi, a veritable procession of American sociologists and anthropologists
came to “discover” the “primitive” Italian South, amongthese George Peck, Donald S. Pitkin, Frederick G.
Friedmann, Leonard W. Moss, Robert D. Putnam, Ann Cornelisen, and Edward Banfield, whoseThe Moral
Basis of a Backwards Society (Glencoe, IL: Free Press, 1958) is duscussed in Chapter 3. Levi’s reputation
as an expert on the South continued to develop long after his death, as chronicled in Sergio D’Amaro and
Gigliola De Donato,eds.,Carlo Levi e il Mezzogiorno: atti della giornata nazionale di studi,
Torremaggiore, 5 novembre 2001 (Foggia: C. Grenzi, 2003). See also Gigliola De Donato, ed.Carlo Levi
nella storia e nella cultura italiana(Manduria: Lacaita, 1993).
8
 Critical analyses of Levi’s writings abound. These include Gene Pampaloni’s “Carlo Levi”
section inDizionario critico della letteratura italiana (Torino: UTET, 1986); Mario Miccinesi,Invito alla
lettura di Carlo Levi (Milano: Mursia, 1977); Gigliola De Donato,Le parole del reale. Ricerche sulla
prosa di Carlo Levi (Bari: Dedalo, 1998); and, for an anthropological perspective, Giovanni Battista
Bronzini’sIl viaggio antropologico di Carlo Levi: da eroe stendhaliano a guerriero birmano (Bari:
Dedalo, 1996). For criticisms of Levi’sCristo, those of Mario Alicata and Carlo Muscetta, discussed later
in this chapter, constitute the most rigorous examples, but see also Vincenzo Napolillo, who criticized
Levi’s vision of southern immobility inCarlo Levi: Dall’antifascismo al mito contadino (Cosenza:
Brenner, 1984) andCarlo Levi e la questione meridionale (Mercogliano: Tipografia Buonadonna, 1972). In
Scrittori e popolo. Il populismo nella letteratura italiana contemporanea (Roma: Savonà e Savelli, 1969),
Italian literary critic Alberto Asor Rosa claimed that the peasant world represented in Cristo was a deeply
self-representational act, while in “I realisti degli anni trenta,” inStoria della letteratura italiana
contemporanea, 4
th
 ed. (Roma: Editori Riuniti, 1977), Giuliano Manacorda sustained that Levi’s novel
produced the South’s otherness in order to better contrast and define the northern bourgeoisie.

 See Rosario Romeo’s classic,Risorgimento e capitalismo (Bari: Laterza, 1959), which discusses
the rural exploitation of the South as counterpart to the industrialization of the North; Vera Zamagni, “Le

place to be. This banishment from national space was undoubtedly influential in
increasing Levi’s anxiety over his feelings of national belonging, but perhaps a yet more
determining factor was the timing of Levi’s arrival in Lucania and the temporal gap that
ensued between this experience and his writing of it. Levi’s forced exile from the nation
took place in the midst of Italy’s imperial war against Ethiopia, and the extent to which
his Lucanian experience was marked by Italian colonial conquest is not negligible.
10
 Levi
was in fact released from confino on the occasion of Italy’s proclamation of Empire with
the conquest of Ethiopia in 1936. However, by the time Leviwrote the novel, between
1943 and 1944, Italy’s standing as an imperial power had almost reversed. By the Fall of
1943, the Italian empire had effectively come to an end
11
. Against this broader setting,
Italy’s internal state was no less insecure: though still theoretically a monarchy ruled by
the House of Savoy, Italy was for all practical purposes split in two: the South, liberated
by the Allies in 1943, was the temporary seat of the reduced Kingdom of Italy, where the
fleeing king had sought refuge and had entered into an alliance with the Allies. The
North, above the so-called Gustav Line that cut across the peninsula at Cassino, was still
controlled by the Fascists and occupied by German troops.
12
 The composition ofCristo si
e` fermato a Eboli from the Fall of 1943 to the summer of 1944 takes place within this
turbulent national setting. In the Preface written for the 1963 edition of theCristo, Levi in
fact makes specific reference to the war then raging in the streets outside his secret
refuge, and defines his act of writing as an “active defense” to stave off death.
13
But Levi’s act of writing is also, as we shall see, an attempt to forestall another
kind of death, one concerning a practice of Italian national self-definition predicated on
the displacement of the South as an internal other. The Italian nation was living the
closing phases of the war in a state of extreme ambiguity and indeterminacy. This context
does more than provide a background to Levi’s writing: it amounts to a fundamental part
of its meaning. While Levi condemned the regime’s imperialist wars in Africa and
supported, within a year of the publication of his novel, Italy’s transition to a Republic,
his writing nonetheless betrays deep anxieties over a drastically changing political
landscape and its possible impact upon the imperial relationship between North and
South that had thus far defined the Italian nation since unification and preserved the
bourgeoisie’s dominant position. Levi may therefore be considered  as consciously anti-
colonialist on the subject of Italy’s “official” colonies abroad and unconsciously
colonialist with respect to the “unofficial” internal colony. Though critical of the Fascist
regime’s colonialism, Levi not only did not pause to question how his entire way of life
was predicated upon the construction of an inferior Other, but he himself participated in
reproducing this Othering.
10

2002), and Giorgio Rochat,Il colonialismo italiano (Torino: Loescher Editore, 1973).
11
 Italy’s colonial situation was, of course, much more complex than can be detailed here. Suffice
it to say that after the fall of Mussolini, Italy lost most of its colonies either to Germany or to the Allies,
surrendering Libya in 1943. In the 1947 Paris peace settlement, Italy lost all effective control of its
colonies, though it maintained a “trusteeship” over Somalia until 1960 and Libya did not become an
independent monarchy until 1951.

A critical reading of Levi’s novel in a postcolonial key reveals both its defense of
certain imperialist premises and its reliance on various literary devices typical of the
colonizer’s construction of the colonized. I do not use the term “postcolonial” in a
temporal sense, which is to say that I do not seek to define a state of political
independence that came after one of colonization. Instead, “postcolonial” marks a
discursive field from which to draw and discuss the effects of imperialism upon the
multiplicity of Italian cultures after 1861. I also do not consider “colonialism” as
requiring the settlement of people in another land (as in fact in the internal Italian model
it did not), but rather as “the conquest and control of other people’s land and goods.”
14
This definition allows for a Marxist approach that distinguishes modern colonialism from
its previous varieties by locating it within the development and expansion of capitalism.
Colonial conquest entailed a novel restructuring of the economies of both the colonizer
and the colonized based upon a complex flow of human and natural resources aimed at
maximizing production in the metropole and creating “captive” markets for those
products in the colonies. Hence the de-industrialization and forced ruralization of the
Italian South following national unification.
15
 As Loomba has argued, whatever their
individual characteristics, all forms of colonialism “produced the economic imbalance
that was necessary for the growth of European capitalism and industry. Thus we could
say that colonialism was the midwife that assisted at the birth of European capitalism, or
that without colonial expansion the transition to capitalism could not have taken place in
Europe.”
16
 This imbalance was precisely the see-saw effect described by Antonio
Gramsci in his influential essay,Some Aspects of the Southern Question (1926), in which
he argued that the “inferiority” and “backwardness” of the Italian South had been not the
unintended consequence but the necessary precondition for the industrialization of
northern Italy and its entry into the European capitalist economy. This form of
colonialism, defined by Lenin as “imperialism,”
17
 does not rely on direct colonial
settlement since it only requires maintaining economic and social relations of dependency
that will guarantee it the necessary forms of captive labor and markets.
18
 Therefore,
though southern Italy was never formally declared a colony, it continues to remain
economically and culturally dependent upon the “mother country.”

 Throughout this
chapter I will be relying on a concept of colonization in which the South functioned
culturally as a colony while being subjected to a political economy that was imperialist.
We will see how this fundamental “colonial imbalance” in the Italian nation
produced but was also produced by practices of signification in the texts we will be
examining. After all, there was a very close tie between the rise of an Italian “national”

language and literature and the nineteenth century experience of internal colonization,
suggesting that the rise of Italian national culture and the exercise of colonial rule were
mutually constitutive. Though much smaller in scale, Italy’s internal experiment in
imperialism runs parallel to the much more notorious Brit ish variet y. As Ashcroft,
Griffiths, and Tiffin argue,
the study of English and the growth of Empire proceeded from a single
ideological climate and [...] the development of one is intrinsically bound
up with the development of the other, both at the level of simple utility (as
propaganda for instance) and at the unconscious level, where it leads to
the naturalizing of constructed values (e.g. civilization, humanity, etc.)
which, conversely, established ‘savagery’, ‘native’, ‘primitive’, as their
antitheses and as the object of a reforming zeal.
20
Cultural products such as literature and film were thus as essential as the army and the tax
officials to colonial rule over the South.
Much of the corpus of “southernist” literature was thus not about “discovering”
the South at all but rather about creating it as an antithesis that ideologically reinforced
the nation as the locus of civilization and modernity.
21
 Similarly, the other-worldliness
Levi “discovered” in Lucania is actually traceable to an earlier time of his life marked by
the rise of totalitarianism across Europe and by a quasi-existentialist need to discover a
pure, virgin world, as yet untouched by the tyrannies of modernity. Levi begins to live in
this suspended time and place as early as 1934, with his first arrest for anti-fascist
activities. As he would write to his family from the Turin prison, “Immerso in questo
tempo che non è né di vita né di morte, giaccio in uno spazio altrettanto irreale [...]
Tempo non tempo
luogo non luogo
se qui mi attempo
nel nulla affogo.

racial laws, escaped back into Italy after the German invasion of France, arrested a third
time in Florence and released after Mussolini’s arrest, and has been living in hiding in a
secret room for over a year as the war rages on. The alternation of repeated, prolonged
exile and confinement is the disturbed setting against which Levi’s imagination of a fixed

homeland produced the “closed” peasant world that he describes as Lucania in his novel:
“Chiuso in una stanza, e in un mondo chiuso, mi e` grato riandare con la memoria a
quell’altro mondo, serrato nel dolore e negli usi, negato alla Storia e allo Stato,
eternamente paziente.”
23
 In this oft-quoted opening passage, Levi introduces his readers
to the object of his attention, the South, as a sick region so “sealed in pain” that it must be
his “eternal patient”. Levi thus opens his novel by reactivating alocus classicus of
discourses that placed the South in a position of passive dependence (the “patient”)
yielding to northern tutelage (the “doctor”).
24
Levi’s opening serves to immediately otherize the South as antithesis to the
nation. Since defining national space requires setting limits and boundaries to separate
that space from the others who have been cleared out of it, it is to this liminal area that we
must look for the content-definition of national space. As a painter, Levi had already
mastered the technique of defining the contours of an indistinct object by fixing the space
immediately beside it. Similarly, national definition occurs as anegative process that
relies upon defining, and then displacing, what it is not – its negative double. Thus,
Lucania stands for everything that Levi’s civilized, modern nation is not. The nation,
which Levi identifies with the standards and values of the northern bourgeoisie, is the
opposite of the Lucania he describes. If Lucania is “backward” and “inferior” it is so in
relation to another space, that of the nation, which is “modern” and “superior.” Edward
Said’s concept of “Orientalism” proves extremely relevant for understanding the function
of southern inferiority in the construction of the Italian nation. Just as the Orient was an
invention by and for Europe, so too the South produced and reproduced in the “Southern
Question” discourse served to define the Italian nation in the act of its ruling over the
South.
The South is thus at once excluded from but necessary to the nation. The
colonizer’s inherent necessity for the colonized was a predicament explained in Albert
Memmi’s eminent treatiseThe Colonizer and the Colonized. In a colonial setting,
colonizer and colonized are locked in a mutually constitutive relationship: the subject
who colonizes, in the act of colonizing another, creates the colonized object, who in turn,
in the act of being colonized, creates the colonizer. The colonizer, however, is torn
between the elimination and the preservation of the colonized. On the one hand, the
racism so essential to the maintenance of the colonial relationship feeds the desire to
eliminate the inferior colonized. On the other hand, the colonizer is held back by a sort of
internal mechanism of preservation that renders the elimination of the colonized an
impossibility, for “to eliminate the colonized from the roll of the living, it would be
impossible for him to do so without eliminating himself.”
25
 The colonizer thus finds

 The rhetorical positioning of the North as authoritative doctor and the South as incapacitated
patient can be traced back to the earliest texts of the Southern Question tradition. In his groundbreaking
“study” of the socio-economic conditions of the South, titled “Condizioni politiche e amministrative della
Sicilia,” in La Sicilia nel 1876, Leopoldo Franchetti made abundant use of medical metaphors that served
to place him, a northern observer, in the position of doctor and Sicily in that of sick patient incapable of
curing or governing itself. For a discussion on the use of such tropes in Franchetti and others, see Nelson
Moe, “The Emergence of the Southern Question in Villari, Franchetti, and Sonnino,” in Schneider,Italy’s
“Southern Question,”68-71, and the section titled “The Wound, the Doctor, the Nation” in hisThe View
From Vesuvius, 172-6.

himself in the paradoxical situation whereby, “having chosen to maintain the colonial
system, he must contribute more vigor to its defense than would have been needed to
dissolve it completely.”
26
This colonial predicament explains the nation’s necessity to define itself by at
once recognizing and negating its internal other, in a double move of recognition and
disavowal. Homi Bhabha defined this dilemma as the “particular ambivalence that haunts
the idea of the nation,” which entails a double movement: in order to recognize the
nation, the author must fix his gaze upon its boundary, outside of which he has relegated
the Other.
27
 In order tosee the nation, and himself as safely ensconced within its space,
the author must literally recognize those he has pushed out. Yet this recognition suggests
a similarity with the colonized that is too terrifying for the colonizer to admit, for this
would reveal the flimsiness of the justification for colonialism. This movement back and
forth that defines the other as “almost the same but not quite” introduces an uncertainty in
the text, an opening for the Other that Bhabha defines as a “partial presence” with the
power to destabilize the authority of the text.
28
In Levi’s writing of the nation, it is the emigrants who constitute this haunting
presence. In order to define the nation, and himself, as the northern “doctor” of an
“eternally patient” South, Levi needs to delineate a circumscribed space immune from
outside influences and the temptations of modernity such that emigration was
introducing. Displaced from the historical, living world, Lucania becomes a world so
sealed off that neither its conquerors, nor History, nor even Christianity have ever really
pierced it –  leaving it, without ever understanding it, locked within an eternal primitivity.
For Levi the Fascist government, like any form of “the State,” had been neither capable
nor even interested in winning over the peasantry. History here had always been “la
Storia altrui” (“the History of others”), a violent imposition to which Lucanian peasants
submitted with passive resignation.
Levi’s interpretation of the emigration phenomenon betrays his need to reinforce
the dichotomy between the northern metropole and its primitive double. In order to
sustain the rigid boundary that closes Lucania off from the nation, Levi forbids any form
of social change from entering the region. Therefore, not even emigration can introduce
any form of renewal, even though Levi’s descriptions often betray sweeping social
changes as resulting from the emigration phenomenon; in order for Levi to deny
emigration its destabilizing potential, he must first acknowledge its import.
One of the changes introduced by emigration was the radical loosening of sexual
mores. Contrary to Levi’s expectations of finding a “traditional” southern culture
domineering towards women, female sexuality was not considered taboo. In fact, despite
his  presumably more cosmopolitan sexual views, Levi himself remarks on the situation
with a certain astonishment: “Le donne, chiuse nei veli, sono come animali selvatici. Non
pensano che all’amore fisico, con estrema naturalezza, e ne parlano con una liberta` e
semplicita` di linguaggio che stupisce.”
29
 Levi recognized that it was emigration which
had changed everything, for with the men gone, the town was now for all practical

purposes a predominantly female domain. This change in sexual mores had accompanied
a more significant transformation of Gagliano’s social structure into a matriarchal
society. Not only female sexual behavior but also an unprecedented high rate of
illegitimate births were now, in the space of a couple of generations, no longer viewed as
social stigmas. In addition to this, and again as a result of emigration, the traditional
gendered division of labor had witnessed a similar transformation, as most of the women
had now taken over the field labor previously performed by the men. Emigration thus
proved destabilizing for the social seclusion and moral immobility Levi attempted to
impose on Lucanian peasant society.
Nowhere were such ruptures more evident than with the returned emigrants, who
prove particularly troublesome for Levi’s depiction of Lucania. Aside from its massive
proportions, Italian emigration was also characterized by a high number of returns, which
amounted to approximately fifty percent.
30
 Though Levi devotes minimal attention to
them and barely glosses over their conspicuous rise in status and wealth, these so-called
“americani” sneak into the margins of the text and leave traces of their destabilizing
power. These returned emigrants essentially form a new social class positioned between
the peasantry and the gentry. Their social differentiation is so manifest that Levi cannot
help noticing it the first time he walks through the town of Gagliano:
Quasi  tutte  le  case  erano  costituite  da  una  sola  stanza,  senza  finestre,  che
prendeva luce dalla porta. Le porte erano sbarrate, poiché i contadini erano
nei campi [....] Qua e là alcune case avevano invece un primo piano, e un
balcone;  e  la  porta  di  strada,  invece  di  essere  di  vecchio  legno  nero  e
consumato, brillava pretensiosamente di vernice, e si adornava di una
maniglia di ottone. Erano le case degli “americani.”
31
Similarly, the only automobile in town belongs to one such repatriated emigrant who had
foreseen the potential earnings of owning the only transportation service. Another
“American” had returned to open a successful barber shop, while yet another had brought
back the impressive tailoring skills learned in America:
[M]i prendeva le misure in pollici, con complicati e originali e moderni
sistemi americani per l’abbassamento della spalla [...] per un vestito alla
cacciatora. Era un artigiano intelligente, abilissimo nel suo mestiere, come
se ne trovano pochi nelle piu` celebrate sartorie di citta`, e mi fece, per
cinquanta lire di fattura, il piu` bell’abito di velluto che io abbia mai
portato. In America guadagnava bene, ora era in miseria.
32
Another repatriated emigrant, a carpenter named Lasala, had even become town mayor in
the past.
Lasala’s character is particularly interesting in that he represents the quintessential
“americano”: along with the only radio in the town (“il suo monumentale
apparecchio”),
33
 Lasala also possessed a veritable commemorative library of
distinguished Italians that included recordings of Caruso, De Pinedo, and Matteotti, a

significant selection that indicates the formation of an “Italian” identity occurring outside
of Italian national space and largely as a result of the emigration experience, rather than
in spite of it.
34
 Ironically, these same individuals who defined themselves as “Italian”
abroad, considered themselves “American” when they returned to Italy, suggesting that
emigration presented the occasion for individuals to imagine themselves as Italians only
within a foreign setting extrapolated from the “mother country.” On the other hand, this
process underscored the volatility of such feelings of national belonging once the
emigrants were reabsorbed within the discriminatory geographic space of the Italian
nation. This complex formation of national identity therefore seems to form in opposition
to the dominant identity which not only Italian political discourse but Levi himself would
impress upon them as “stateless” individuals in need of foreign rule.
This is why the emigrants are such disturbing figures in Levi’s narrative, for they
influence those back home with a newly acquired “consciousness of statehood,” as
represented by the ubiquitous photo, so vexing for Levi, of President Roosevelt in
peasants’ homes, and by the iconographic status of New York as the new capital of their
imagined community. Their capital, more than Rome or Naples, Levi complains, is now
New York. Rome and Naples, as centers of old sacred and dynastic power, had been
eclipsed by New York. Of course, New York as the peasants’ new capital also signified a
new, and much more worrisome, possibility for Levi: it was the confirmation that
peasants no longer looked, if they ever had, to what for Levi was the metropole of the
Italian nation. Since they were not free to rule over themselves, they chose to subject
themselves to a hegemonic power other than –and “superior” to – that of Italy. Franklin
Roosevelt’s photograph on the peasants’ walls signifies the failure of the dominant
culture of Italy, which Levi represents, to win hegemony in this region. If ever Levi had
required further proof that the southern colony was slipping away from the nation, he
found it in the peasants’ eloquent gesture to reject the photograph of the Italian King in
favor of that of the American President.
However, it is more precisely as agents of modernity that the returned emigrants
prove threatening to the stability of Levi’s boundaries, for they are the bearers of modern
instruments and techniques, world views and means of communication that place Lucania
in the center of that “outside world” where important historical events are occurring.
Emigrants, even when far away, are the source of everything new, from actual world
news and networks of assistance, to machinery and techniques. The only transportation
service and radio belong to returned emigrants, and Levi more than once describes the
villagers gathering around the automobile every evening to receive news and mail. Levi’s
explanation of this process is worth quoting at length, as it illustrates his simultaneous
realization and disavowal of the important modernizing function of emigration:
I paesi di Lucania, mezzi di qua e mezzi di là del mare, sono rimasti
spezzati in due. Le famiglie si sono separate, le donne sono rimaste sole:
per quelli di qui, l’America si è allontanata, e con lei ogni possibile
salvezza. Soltanto la posta porta continuamente qualcosa che viene di

laggiù [...] arrivano forbici, coltelli, rasoi, strumenti agricoli, falcetti,
martelli, tenaglie, tutte le piccole macchine della vita comune. La vita di
Gagliano, per quello che riguarda i ferri dei mestieri, è tutta americana,
come lo è per le misure: si parla, dai contadini, di pollici e di libbre
piuttosto che di centimetri o di chilogrammi. Le donne, che filano la lana
su vecchi fusi, tagliano il filo con splendidi forbicioni di Pittsburg: i rasoi
del barbiere sono i più perfezionati ch’io abbia mai visto in Italia, e
l’acciaio azzurro delle scuri che i contadini portano sempre con sé, è
acciaio americano. Essi non sentono alcuna prevenzione contro questi
strumenti moderni, né alcuna contraddizione fra di essi e i loro antichi
costumi. Prendono volentieri quello che arriva da New York, come
prenderebbero volentieri quello che arrivasse da Roma. Ma da Roma non
arriva nulla. Non era mai arrivato nulla [...].
35
The emigrants do not use the standard measures and tools of the Italian metric system but
are quite comfortable, better off in fact, using the American ones. Emigration in short
was what helped Lucanians toremain “modern,” through the standardization and
improvement of measurements, instruments and techniques, in ways that entirely
bypassed and even surpassed those of the metropole.
36
Levi’s sense that something is awry in the Lucanians’ possession of these marks
of modernity is unmistakable, but there is something more in these passages on the
emigrants, an unease and a preoccupation that belie Levi’s thesis on the Lucanians’
submissiveness. The fact is that Levi’s observations about the emigrants, no matter how
fatalistic, betray a profound transformation taking place in the social structure of the
South. The emigrants neither left nor returned to continue working the land. The great
demise of the peasant world so lamented during the economic boom of the late 1950s and
early 1960s had actually begun a century earlier, with “la grande emigrazione” that
followed national unification. Italian mass emigration has at times been interpreted as a
sort of great peasant revolution

, Francesco Paolo Cerase distinguishes between different kinds of return migration, such as
returns due to failure or returns due to prospects of investment. The latter is of particular interest to us, for
it is chiefly this category that Levi represents in his account but which he collapses into the “failure”
category. Yet for these emigrants, as Cerase specifies, “il ritorno non è stato [...] un semplice reinserimento
in una realtà preesistente ed immutabile. Al contrario, è stato considerato come la ricerca di una più
profonda affermazione delle proprie capacità; un’opportunitàper mettere pienamente alla prova quanto di
nuovo ciascuno aveva appreso e possedeva – in termini di nuove idee, nuovi strumenti di lavoro, nuovi
valori, nuove risorse. Tutto ciò è stato proiettato nella terra di origine come luogo in cui potesse meglio
trovare una piena utilizzazione [...] Per un verso le loro risorse, i loro obiettivi ed aspirazioni, la loro
diversità quanto ad atteggiamenti e modi di pensare hanno rappresentato un potenziale prezioso per
l’innovazione non solo economica, ma anche culturale, dei loro paesi d’origine.” Francesco Paolo Cerase,
“L’onda di ritorno: i rimpatri,” inStoria dell’emigrazione italiana 1, 125. For more on return migration,
refer to Dino Cinel’sThe National Integration of Italian Return Migration, 1870-1929(Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1991), which, though covering a period preceding World War II, still offers a
wealth of information, especially on the topics of emigrant remittances and returnee investments.
37
 Among the most notable sustainers of this thesis were the “Meridionalisti”  Francesco Saverio
Nitti, “L’emigrazione italiana e i suoi avversari,”Scritti sulla questione meridionale, I:Saggi sulla storia
del Mezzogiorno, emigrazione e lavoro. (Bari: Laterza, 1958), and Napoleone Colajanni, “Gl’italiani delle
colonie,” inLatini e Anglo-Sassoni (Razze inferiori e razze superiori) (Napoli, Roma: La Rivista Popolare,
1906).

12
that mass emigration constituted a “great refusal” of colonial exploitation, it does seem
irrefutable that Italian mass emigration was, in the last instance, a rejection of the rural
way of life. This would explain the emigrants’ destinations of choice in the great
industrial cities of Europe and North America. The predominantly northern Italian
emigration to South America of the late nineteenth century had already abated as a
consequence of the industrialization of northern Italy, France and Germany, which
absorbed this migrant labor force.
38
 Somewhat later, beginning around 1900, when Italian
mass emigration became a distinctly southern phenomenon, the southern peasants who
abandoned their land did not go in search of other land. They sought instead the bustling
cities and vastly expanding industrial economies of the United States and Canada, which
is to say the most obvious antithesis of the world they had left behind.
39
 Though their
abandonment of an agrarian form of life for an urban industrial one for which they had no
skills usually spelled continued exploitation in the New World, it also represented a
crucial break with old relations of power that were, before anything else, colonial. Even
more significant for our purposes here, those who returned generally demonstrated far
less interest for land ownership than would have been expected. The purchase or
construction of a house – especially the American single-family model –far exceeded the
purchase of land, which had historically been a universal peasant aspiration.
40
Significantly, none of the returned emigrants Levi describes work the land; all have
moved to the service sector or have opened small commercial ventures, indicating an
important move up the social hierarchy even if in economic terms the improvement was
marginal. These implications prove even more striking in light of what Levi tells us about
local emigration figures: while the town of Gagliano has 1,200 inhabitants, 2,000 of its
citizens are in the United States. The fact that two thirds of the town’s population has,
within the space of a single generation, abandoned one way of life for another testifies to
the dramatic effects of emigration on the socio-economic structure of this part of the
South.
Thus what proves particularly upsetting for Levi’s task of reinforcing the
boundary between nation and colonial space is not so much his oft-lamentedlack of a
modern national subject in Lucania, but rather thepresence, what we have been calling a
“partial presence,” of a cosmopolitan Other whose migration has introduced a certain
mobility – geographic as well as across gender and class lines – in a world Levi would
have us imagine as inert for millennia until his own god-like descent stirred it magically
to life. Levi’s reaction to these misfits moving across the boundary he so carefully
constructs creates the “ambivalence” between recognition and disavowal. This movement
mirrors the dual strategy Zygmunt Bauman identifies as the quintessentially modern
approach to the migrant other: on the one hand there is the drive foranthropoemy, which
means to vomit up or expel; on the other, there is the conflicting move ofanthropophagy,
which is to cannibalize or assimilate.

her; the second tends to annul significant differences in the other so that he or she may be
swallowed up by the dominant culture demanding “integration.” Both tendencies,
however, refuse to grant thisalter figure its autonomy and ultimately seek its
disappearance.
We can observe Levi caught in the same anxious movement. His first mention of
a returned emigrant entails an othering of the car owner: “un ‘americano’, un uomo
grande, grosso e biondo, con un berretto da ciclista, noto in paese per una sua gigantesca
particolarità anatomica [...] che rendeva forse desiderabili, ma certamente pericolosi alle
donne i contatti con lui.”
42
 Interestingly, this over-sexualized motorist is the same man
who transports and distributes the daily mail. The warning is clear: the returned emigrants
constitute “dangerous contacts”; though the well-endowed “americani” may hold great
appeal, the community should beware of how much it allows their excessively modern
ways to penetrate their pure archaic world.
43
On the other hand, Levi also resorts to anthropophagy when, in a last-ditch effort,
he attempts to collapse this partial presence into the still Lucanian community he has
constructed, refusing to assign any great significance to the sometimes radical cultural
and socio-economic transformations wrought by emigration:
Quelli  che  ritornano,  dopo  vent’anni,  sono  identici  a  quando  erano  partiti
[....] In America, essi vivono a parte, fra di loro: non partecipano alla vita
americana  [...]  e  risparmiano  i  pochi  dollari  [....]  Poi,  tornano  un  giorno
in  Italia,  [...]  qualcuno  offre  loro  una  piccola  terra  da  comprare...  [si]
sposano [....] e in pochissimo tempo è tornata la miseria, la stessa eterna
miseria di quando, tanti anni prima, erano partiti. E con la miseria torna la
rassegnazione,  la  pazienza,  e  tutti  i  vecchi  usi  contadini:  in  breve,  questi
americani non si distinguono più in nulla da tutti gli altri contadini, se non
per  una  maggiore  amarezza,  il  rimpianto,  che  talvolta  affiora,  d’un  bene
perduto.
44
Though Levi himself has demonstrated that these individuals have undergone
such transformation as to have taken themselves out of the peasant class, he is
compelled to conclude that those who return are ultimately swallowed up by the
immobility of peasant life once more.

 It should be noted that sexualization is a recurring rhetorical strategy for constructing the
colonial Other. Edward Said once identified the sexualization of the Orient as “a remarkably persistent
motif in Western attitudes to the Orient [...] the Orient seems still to suggest not only fecundity but sexual
promise (and threat), untiring sensuality, unlimited desire, deep generative energies.” Edward Said,

“the ideological construction and consolidation of white masculinity as normative and the corresponding
racialization and sexualization of colonized peoples” inThird World Women and the Politics of Feminism
(Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1991), 15; while Rachel Alsop, Annette Fitzsimons, and
Kathleen Lennon, eds., argue that “Western constructions of sexuality formulated during the period of
colonial expansion are inherently racist, equating sexual excess and a lack of civilization in their
conceptualizations of the colonized. White, Western discourses traditionally define African men as having
animal-like, uncontrollable sexual demands; oriental men (and women) as subservient, yet perversely
malleable” inTheorizing Gender (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2002), 151.

Levi’s text therefore demonstrates,contra-Levi, that Lucania, far from being a
petrified, impermeable enclave, was at this time undergoing significant changes as a
result of emigration and war, some of which had already become evident during Levi’s
confinement there. But precisely because emigration did have far-reaching effects on a
society that Levi needed, for ideological reasons, to keep closed, he is ambivalent about
granting it any innovative power. Giving the Lucanian peasants mobility and the
authority to cross the boundaries he had erected around their world would have freed
them from the condition of “eternal patients” – obviating Levi’s function as “doctor” with
all the implicit powers over the life and death of the dependent colonial population.
The emigrants are forbidden from tampering with the seals Levi has placed
around Lucania just as God is interdicted from descending further South than Eboli: in
the claustrophobic kingdom Levi has created there is room only for himself, the northern
demi-god. As his novel progresses from historical anecdotes to pseudo-ethnographic
observations, Lucanians are gradually dehumanized, alternating between frightening half-
beasts to underworldlings with sinister magical customs. Under the stroke of Levi’s pen,
the local language becomes a series of spells evoked to maintain the region in a
suspended, out-of-timeness. Levi dismisses as a “contradiction in their language” the fact
that locals have such a rich variety of expressions with which to express temporality.
45
He is much more interested in linguistic expressions and old proverbs that he can
interpret and transcribe as magical formulas, of which the language is full, for here “la
ragione e la scienza [...] non sono ancora , e forse non saranno mai, divinità ascoltate e
adorate.”
46
 Even the “sanaporcelle” is described as a witch doctor performing a sacrifice
rather than a rustic castrator of pigs. And so a dance to a bagpipe becomes a primitive,
animal-like “love dance” ritual, and so on.
Levi finds the women to be particularly beastly. He begins by observing how to
him they do not even appear to be women but a strange fleet of vessels
47
 Next, he
confesses that they remind him of sheep, and smell like them too;
48
 or of strange queen-
bird creatures;
49
 and finally, they are a bunch of sex-crazed wild animals.
50
 Upon his first
encounter with Giulia la Santarcangelese, the woman who becomes his servant in
Gagliano, he describes her as possessing a statuesque figure and animal-like strength, the
teeth of a wolf and the head of a snake, and as worshiping “eternal animal divinities.”
51
Levi also constructs a colonial relationship with local peasants through repeated
gestures of feudal ownership. In the novel’s Preface, Levi tellingly employs a possessive
pronoun to refer to the peasants (“i miei contadini” – “my peasants”). Next, he makes us
privy to various acts of feudal deference on their part: the peasants requesting his medical
attentions beg him, bless him, and even kiss his hands. “Era forse,” he concedes, “il
prestigio naturale del forestiero che viene da lontano, e che è perciò come un dio.”
52
 Here
he is still somewhat vague, ascribing the appeal to any foreigner who comes from “far

15
away.” But later on, inspired by a visit from his sister, he becomes more precise about the
motives for his superiority: in a place that was
piu` lontan[o] che l’India e la Cina [...] capivo ad un tratto come questi
due  tempi  fossero,  fra  loro,  incomunicabili;  come  queste  due  civilta`  non
potessero avere nessun rapporto se non miracoloso. E mi rendevo conto
del  perche’  i  contadini  guardino  il  forestierodel nord come qualcuno che
viene da un al di la`, come un dio straniero.
53
Thus, it is Levi’s differentiation of the Lucanians, placing them “further than India or
China” from Italy, that constructs his superiority. Again and again Levi portrays himself
as a god who has “fallen from the sky” and whose servant has come to consider not only
her lord and master (especially after he deems it appropriate to underscore his authority
by striking her) but also a divine power: “Mi supponeva un grande potere;”
54
 “per la
Giulia avrei assommato tutte le virtu` [...] del guaritore sacro.”
55
 Even his medical
attentions, which by his own admission were unremarkable given that he had never
actually practiced medicine, begin to resemble the Raising of Lazarus: “E io passavo di
meraviglia in meraviglia, vedendo questi malati, che qualunque buon medico avrebbe
giudicato perduti, migliorare e guarire con le cure più elementari. Pareva che mi aiutasse
una strana fortuna;”
56
 “la mia fama di medico miracoloso andava crescendo; e spesso
venivano dei malati anche da paesi lontani, per consultarmi;”
57
 “Vidi, con stupore, che
ero aspettato. Si sapeva che ero stato al Pantano, si sperava che passassi di là al ritorno. I
contadini e le donne erano in strada, per farmi buona accoglienza: i più strani malati si
erano fatti portare sugli usci, perché io li vedessi. Pareva una corte dei miracoli.”
58
Carlo Levi, the painter and writer banished from the nation, gradually fabricates
the more secure identity of Don Carlo, the northern god adored by the adults who pay
homage  with gifts and blessings – even of the Fascist mayor he says, “mi amava” (“he
loved me”)
59
 – and revered by the children who fight over the honor of carrying his
painting supplies until Levi would intervene “come un dio inappellabile, a scegliere e
giudicare.”
60
 Not coincidentally, he has named the stray dog he has adopted “Barone,” a
strange animal who amazes the villagers with his “heraldic” aspect, “il leone rampante
sullo scudo di un signore.” Naturally, Levi identifies with such a noble creature, “poiché
pare che i potenti, nel loro terrore del sacro, abbiano scoperto che anche in me è una
doppia natura, e che, anch’io sono mezzo barone e mezzo leone”
61
 – a belief confirmed
by the children’s singing to him:
Aggio cantato sovra ’nu varcone
e Don Carlo è ’nu varone
Sona cupille si voi sunà

It seems, in other words, that the narration of his out-of-nation experience provided Levi
with the opportunity to assert his authority by appointing himself lord and master, god
and sorcerer of the colony. “Il mio orologio si era fermato, e nessun rintocco di fuori
poteva giungermi e indicarmi il passare del tempo, dove il tempo non scorre.”
63
It should by now be apparent that Levi’s novel belongs to that body of works that
Said called “imperialist literature,” for, like all imperialist works, it attempts to conceal
the groundlessness of the metropole’s superiority by arguing that
the source of the world’s significant action and life is in the West, whose
representatives seem at liberty to visit their fantasies and philanthropies
upon a mind-deadened Third World. In this view, the outlying regions of
the world have no life, history or culture to speak of, no independence or
integrity worth representing without the West. And when there is
something to be described it is [...] unutterably corrupt, degenerate,
irredeemable.
64
Indeed, Levi’s masterpiece makes a hefty contribution to the accumulation of “the great
cultural archive” of colonial rule, participating in the production of an image of Italy in
which the southern regions were viewed “with a combination of familiarity and distance,
but never with a sense of their separate sovereignty.”
65
When Carlo Levi’s novel was published, especially before the 1948 electoral
victory of the Christian Democrats, many meridionalisti of the Left harbored high hopes
for an economic and political renewal of the South that would also have granted the
peasantry a more active role in national politics.
66
 Some of the harshest critiques of
Cristo si e` fermato a Eboli came from Leftist circles where expectations and
commitment to social change were high. Literary critic Carlo Muscetta, for instance,
denounced the novel as the delusion of a megalomaniac: “la discesa di Carlo Levi, pittore
e medico, stregone e scrittore, è rappresentata nel suo stesso libro come una vera
Epifania, come l’avvento e la rivelazione di una divinità da adorare.”
67
Muscetta was skeptical about the actual “shock” Levi registered upon his arrival
in the rural South, given that he had been primed by a whole Southern Question tradition
that for generations had labored to construct precisely that South through the definition,
measurement, and solution of the “problem” of the South. Muscetta thus accused Levi of
belonging to that tradition that continued to construct Italy’s national identity through the
ghettoization and othering of the South: “Quell’antifascista dell’ ‘altra’ Italia si doveva
ritenere piu` che preparato culturalmente e psicologicamente a intendere il Sud. Egli
apparteneva a quel gruppo d’intellettuali che si erano radunati intorno a Gobetti,
63

 Among these intellectuals were writer-politician Manlio Rossi-Doria, head of the Agricultural
Department of the University of Naples in Portici and Scotellaro’s mentor in the final years of his life;
writer activist Danilo Dolci, who took part in the non-violent peasant land occupations and “reverse
strikes” in Sicily; author Giovanni Russo, writer-politician Tommaso Fiore; journalist, writer and politician
Francesco Compagna, who also founded the journalNord e Sud; and Marxist politician Giorgio Amendola,
founder of the journalCronache Meridionali. For an account of the various threads running through
postwar “meridionalismo” and the various figures involved, see Mirko Grasso, Scoprire l’Italia: inchieste
e documentari degli anni Cinquanta (Calimera (LE): Kurumuny, 2007).

realizzando una feconda intesa con i Fortunato e i Salvemini, e soprattutto coi Dorso e gli
altri giovani meridio nalist i del Sud e del Nord, persuasi della necessita` di riproporre la
questione meridionale secondo nuove prospettive.”
68
Though Muscetta was not working within a postcolonial perspective, he
nonetheless recognized and condemned the colonial subtext of Levi’s novel. After Levi
“advances grandiosely towards apotheosis,”
69
 Muscetta observed acerbically, the novel
could only come to its rightful conclusion: Don Carlo receives his pardon  and the
permission to return home, but the locals do not want him to leave, so they threaten to slit
the tires of the automobile that will carry him away. It seems, Muscetta objects, like
reading the final pages of Melville’s Polynesian adventure,Typee, “ ‘Kannaka [the
natives] no let you go nowhere [...] you taboo.”
70
The most interesting aspect of Muscetta’s critique, however, is his recognition of
the central problem presented by the gaze of the colonized returning that of the colonizer:
“Fin dal primo capitolo [...], ci rendiamo conto che, se ha importanza il problema com’è
apparsa la Lucania a Carlo Levi, c’è un problema almeno altrettanto importante e anzi
pregiudiziale: com’è apparso Levi alla Lucania.”
71
 Indeed, this “problem” is what
ultimately destabilizes Levi’s authority. The incessant reappearance of the partial
presence is, as we have seen, a continuous affirmation of the difference of the Lucanians
from the god-like Levi/Don Carlo. Levi’s narration of this difference, such as through
their reverence of him, requires him to consider how he appears to them, opening up a
space for the colonized to look back at him. This is the colonized gazing back at the
colonizer theorized by Bhabha: “the look of surveillance returns as the displacing gaze of
the disciplined, where the observer becomes the observed and ‘partial’ representation
rearticulates the whole notion ofidentityand alienates it from essence.”
72
 This means that
ultimately Levi must admit for this partial presence to have the power to shape his own
identity as well, thereby rendering it, too, a “partial presence.” This returned gaze thus
“reverses ‘in part’ the colonial appropriation by now producing a partial vision of the
colonizer’s presence; a gaze of otherness, that [...] shatters the unity of man’s being
through which he extends his sovereignty.”
73
This “partialization” of the author’s identity, an alienation from himself, has the
radically disruptive effect of denying him the security of ever feeling “at home” again,
detaching him from his own environment. To be sure, once Levi’s “apotheosis” is
complete, he experiences just such a rupture when he is allowed a short visit “home” to
Turin on account of a sudden death in the family:
Il mio soggiorno fu melanconico, a parte la ragione dolorosa del viaggio.
Mi aspettavo il più vivo piacere nel rivedere la città, nel parlare con i
vecchi amici, nel ripartecipare per un momento a una vita molteplice e
movimentata: ma ora sentivo in me un distacco che non sapevo superare,
un senso di infinita lontananza, una difficoltà di adesione che mi
impedivano di godere dei beni ritrovati [...] Mi pareva che una parte di me

fosse ormai estranea a quel mondo [...] quella loro vita non era più la mia

74
The anxiety to reaffirm his authority produced a tension in Levi’s writing that
transcended the strict confines of his own narrative space and led him to engage with
other writings in a continual deferral of the ambivalence inCristo. In different ways, the
writings of Ignazio Silone and Rocco Scotellaro presented an indirect challenge to Levi’s
authority over the South, as both propose versions of more complex “souths” seen from
the point of view of historically active indigenous subjects. Through the textual devices
ofappropriation andabrogation, the “standard” language and “universal” spatio-
temporal values of the imperial center are interrogated and destabilized, so that the act of
writing becomes an act of contending power and authority with the dominant culture
75
.
Appropriation in this case refers to the process whereby the experience of
marginalization is expressed in the language of the imperial center, whileabrogation
refers to the rejection of the standards and values that make up the imperial culture,
coming very close to its dictionary definition as the annulmentby authority of any law,
custom or inst itution. One can easily see then why abrogation is “a vital moment in the
de-colonization of the language.”
76
Carlo Levi and Ignazio Silone
Levi’s novel provides a classic example of “appropriation” when read
comparatively with the work of Ignazio Silone, pen-name of writer Secondino Tranquilli
(1900-1978) born in Pescina dei Marsi, near L’Aquila, in the southern region of Abruzzo.
A founder of the Italian Communist Party, Silone began his writing career as a journalist
for various socialist and communist newspapers. In 1927, he traveled to Moscow with
Togliatti and participated in the Komintern meetings that brought about the expulsion of
Trotsky. Silone opposed the expulsion and abandoned the Communist Party and Italy in
1930. He lived in exile in Switzerland, where he began his work as an anti-fascist
novelist. His first two novels,Fontamara andPane e Vino (Bread and Wine, 1936),
written in the first years of his exile, are in fact the most well-known and appreciated of
his oeuvre. Set in rural communities of his native Abruzzo during the Fascist regime, the
novels are at once sketches of the way of life of the “cafoni” and blueprints for peasant
revolutionary action against their oppressors. When Silone resumed political activity,
with the Italian Socialist Party’s foreign office, he was arrested by Swiss authorities and
sent first to the Zurich prison and then to the internment camps in Baden and Davos.
After returning to Italy in the mid-1940s, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly
with the Socialist Party in the Abruzzo college. He remained in politics until 1956, year
in which he founded and directed the literary cultural journalTempo Presente. Silone’s
first postwar novel,Una manciata di more (1952), is also set among southern peasants,
74
 Levi,Cristo, 218.
75
 I am not imputing a conscious critical design upon the works of Silone or Scotellaro, as both
colonial domination and resistance to it, when occurring textually, such as through literature, are more
often than not unconscious processes, and are inscribed surreptitiously within the text. We have seen this be
the case with Levi and it was certainly the case with Scotellaro, who regarded Levi an inspiration for his
own work. That “no utterance is innocent” means that communication occurs as a struggle over meanings
even when the author may him/herself be unconsciously or uncritically reproducing hegemonic meanings.
76
 Ashcroft, Griffiths and Tiffin,Empire Writes Back, 37.

19
who this time are rising up against local Communist authorities, suggesting that for
Silone a simple change in the political parties in power was not enough to change age-old
structures of oppression. He is remembered today as a controversial intellectual figure
who denounced social injustice and fought for intellectual freedom (he once defined
himself as “a Socialist without a party and a Christian without a church”) and who
opposed totalitarianism of any stamp – Fascist or Communist. His political ambivalence
has in more recent years been complicated by the controversy regarding his presumed
espionage activities for the Fascist regime.
77
 Although Silone’s subsequent novels did not
meet with the same popular success of his first ones, he is considered a pillar of Italian
twentieth-century literature, and his peasant novels constitute, along with the works of
Alvaro, Levi, and Scotellaro, thesine qua non of Italian literary neorealism.
78
If Levi’sCristo shares certain themes with Silone’sFontamara, it is because he
appropriated some of its key features. Written in 1930,Fontamara was published in 1933
in German translation. Banned in Italy because of its anti-Fascist content, bootleg copies
of the work in the Italian language were published in Switzerland and France. An official
edition of the novel was not published in Italy until after the war, in 1945. Despite such
obscure beginnings, however, the novel was translated in twenty seven languages and
was widely read in Europe. Set in the Abruzzo region in the fictional town of Fontamara,
the novel narrates the peasants’ resistance to the injustices suffered under the Fascist
regime.
Levi’s identity as a political activist and as a writer was profoundly influenced by
Silone’s works. In some of his anti-Fascist writings, Levi used the pseudonym Pietro
Spina, which was the name of the anti-Fascist revolutionary hero in Silone’s 1936 novel,
Pane e Vino (Bread and Wine). In a passage of theCristo Levi claimed he felt “celato,
ignoto agli uomini, nascosto come un germoglio sotto la scorza dell’albero,” an obvious
reference to Silone’s 1942 novel on revolutionary hope,Il seme sotto la neve (The Seed
Under the Snow). Levi was thus not only very familiar with Silone’s work but evidently
shared its revolutionary flair.
More to the point, a comparative reading demonstrates that the Preface ofCristo
si e` fermato a Eboli echoes that ofFontamara, in which the social and moral terrain of
the peasant way of life is laid out, so that for those who have read one of these novels, the
other appears oddlydéjà vu :
Per vent’anni [...] le solite angustie, le solite pene, la solita miseria: la
miseria ricevuta dai padri, che l’avevano ereditata dai nonni, e contro la
quale il lavoro onesto non è mai servito proprio a niente. Le ingiustizie più
77
 Ignazio Silone’s secret life as a Fascist spy was brought to light by Dario Biocca and Mauro
Canali inL’informatore: Silone, I comunisti e la polizia (Milano: Luni, 2000) and in Dario Biocca’s Silone.
La doppia vita di un italiano (Milano: Rizzoli, 2005). Elizabeth Leake provides a psychoanalytic reading of
Silone’s works in light of his double life inThe Reinvention of Ignazio Silone (Toronto: University of
Toronto Press, 2003); while Stanislao Pugliese’sBitter Spring: A Life of Ignazio Silone (New York: Farrar,
Straus and Giroux, 2009) attempts to provide a more multi-faceted perspective of Silone by examining the
fascist espionage controversy in light of Silone’s literary and political life.
78
 For a general biography of Silone, refer to Pugliese’sBitter Spring. For Silone’s take on his own
literary and political experiences, the collection of interviews in Luca D’Eramo’sIgnazio Silone (Rimini:
Editori Riminesi Associati, 1994) is quite informative, while the best critical analysis of Silone’s work is
probably still that provided by Richard W.B. Lewis in hisThe Picaresque Saint: Representative Figures in
Contemporary Fiction (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1959).

20
crudeli vi erano così antiche da aver acquistato la stessa naturalezza della
pioggia, del vento della neve. La vita degli uomini, delle bestie e della
terra sembrava così racchiusa in un cerchio immobile saldato dalla chiusa
morsa delle montagne e dalle vicende del tempo. Saldato in un cerchio
naturale, immutabile, come in una specie di ergastolo.
79
The key terms of  injustice, immobility, seclusion, timelessness, and the naturalization of
these immediately bring to mind the major themes of Levi’s narrative.
The greatest similarity between the two texts, however, lies in their anti-
emigrationist views. Silone harbors a fatalistic view of emigration, regarding it as futile
and at times even a betrayal of the revolutionary cause. Yet however pessimistic his
judgment may be, Silone is clear about two issues: first, emigration is a necessity for the
southern regions as it is the only resource of survival available to the peasantry; and
secondly, the peasant’s condition has only worsened with the Fascist ban on emigration:
[L]a proibizione dell’emigrazione aveva interrotto la partenza dei giovani,
i quali erano costretti a restare a Fontamara, e così il lavoro era diventato
scarso per tutti. L’impossibilità di emigrare significava l’impossibilità di
guadagnare e risparmiare quel tanto che permettesse di conservare il
piccolo fondo paterno corroso dai debiti e dalle ipoteche.
80
While Levi does not care to pause on the necessity of emigration, his emphasis on
the regret of the returned emigrants bears an uncanny resemblance to what is a recurring
theme in Silone’s novels, as a comparison between these two key passages demonstrates:
Una volta almeno riusciva ai montanari di fuggire in America. Perfino
alcuni Fontamaresi, prima della guerra, tentarono la sorte in Argentina e in
Brasile. Ma quelli di essi che poterono mettere assieme, tra il corpetto e la
camicia, dalla parte del cuore, alcuni biglietti di banca, e tornarono a
Fontamara, in pochi anni perdettero sui terreni aridi e sterili della contrada
nativa i pochi risparmi e ricaddero presto nell’antico letargo, conservando
come un ricordo di paradiso perduto l’immagine della vita intravista
oltremare.
81
Quelli che ritornano, dopo vent’anni, sono identici a quando erano
partiti... risparmiano i pochi do llari: sono vicini al paradiso, ma non
pensano neppure di entrarci. Poi, tornano un giorno in Italia ... qualcuno
offre loro una piccola terra da comprare .... e in pochissimo tempo e`
tornata la miseria... e con la miseria torna la rassegnazione.... In breve
questi americani non si distinguono piu` in nulla da tutti gli altri contadini,
se non per una maggiore amarezza, il rimpianto, che talvolta affiora, d’un
bene perduto.
82
The depiction of return emigration as a “paradise lost” is so similar in the two texts as to
seem penned by the same author. This act of incorporating Silone’s outlook on

21
emigration into his own text helps to grant Levi’s own narrative with regard to emigration
greater legitimacy.
However, there are fundamental differences between the two texts that prove
“unassimilable,” and it is in the tension between these differences that we find what was
most radical in Silone’s novel that motivated Levi’s act of appropriation in the first place.
To begin with, Silone’s novel describes an evolving situation, in which oppression under
the Fascist regime heightens to an unbearable degree. Through a metaphorical “regime”
of moonlight, the opening paragraph ofFontamara manages beautifully to convey the
Fascist seizure of power as a regression and a failure of modernity:
Il primo di giugno dell’anno scorso Fontamara rimase per la prima volta
senza illuminazione elettrica. Il due di giugno, il tre di giugno, il quattro di
giugno, Fontamara continuò a rimanere senza illuminazione elettrica. Così
nei giorni seguenti e nei mesi seguenti, finché Fontamara si riabituò al
regime del chiaro di luna. Per arrivare dal chiaro di luna alla luce elettrica,
Fontamara aveva messo un centinaio di anni, attraverso l’olio di oliva e il
petrolio. Per tornare dalla luce elettrica al chiaro di luna bastò una sera.
83
One of the most obvious differences between the two texts, in fact, is that Silone’s
account is of arevolution occurring in the peasant world, not just in Fontamara but in
countless other towns like it across the South: “Però l’anno scorso si produssero una serie
di fatti imprevisti e incomprensibili che sconvolsero la vita di Fontamara.”
84
Moreover, Silone makes no mistake that the peasants’ misery is due to a colonial
structure of exploitation, characterizing the valley surrounding Fontamara as “sottoposta
a un regime coloniale,” so that its considerable resources “impinguano un ceto ristretto di
indigeni e per il resto emigrano verso la metropoli.”
85
 Nor does Silone obscure the role of
the Piedmontese monarchy in this mechanism of exploitation. While colonial exploitation
began with the Napoleonic invasion of the South and continued under Bourbon rule, it
was exacerbated by the Savoy government: “[I]n cambio dell’appoggio politico che egli
offrì alla debole dinastia piemontese, Torlogne ricevette le terre in proprietà perpetua, fu
insignito del titolo di duca e più tardi di quello di principe. La dinastia piemontese gli
regalò insomma una cosa che non le apparteneva.”
86
 Thus, Savoy rule finds its rightful
place in the list of foreign rulers who had exploited the local population, and in turn the
locals are depicted as historically-developed subjects.
Thus Fontamara is not an “exceptional” place, nor is the revolution that occurs
there an isolated episode. This historical connectedness is extended to its inhabitants;
Silone unites the peasants of Fontamara in a common struggle with all the victims of
colonization: “[I] contadini poveri, gli uomini che fanno fruttificare la terra e soffrono la
fame, i fellahin i coolies i peones i mugic i cafoni, si somigliano in tutti i paesi del
mondo; sono, sulla faccia della terra, nazione a sé, razza a sé, chiesa a sé.”
87
But it is Silone’s appropriation of the “standard” Italian language that proves,
ironically, to be the most destabilizing factor ofFontamara. To begin with, the novel

 Ibid., 15.

22
opens with Silone claiming the power to name the setting of his story: “Ho dato questo
nome [...].”
88
 More radical yet is Silone’s reappropriation of the pejorative term used to
refer to southern peasants, “cafoni” (similar to the English term “boor”) in a proud
reclamation of the peasants’ self-respect and honor: “(Io so bene che il nome di cafone,
nel linguaggio corrente del mio paese, sia della campagna che della città, è ora termine di
offesa e dileggio; ma io l’adopero in questo libro nella certezza che quando nel mio paese
il dolore non sarà più vergona, esso diventerà nome di rispetto, e forse anche di
onore.).”
89
Especially after the nationalizing impetus of unification, it became standard
practice in Italy to write prose in a literary language that little resembled the variety of
languages actually spoken in the peninsula.
90
 Indeed, Silone’s use of “standard” Italian
would have been so taken for granted that it would have gone unnoticed, had he not made
a pointed declaration in this regard. In the closing of his Preface, Silone addresses the
important issue of his choice of language:
A nessuno venga in mente che i Fontamaresi parlino l’italiano. La lingua
italiana è per noi una lingua imparata a scuola, come possono essere il
latino, il francese, l’esperanto. La lingua italiana è per noi una lingua
straniera, una lingua morta, una lingua in cui il dizionario, la cui
grammatica si sono formati senza alcun rapporto con noi, col nostro modo
di esprimerci.
91
There is no clearer way to convey the estrangement of the peasants from the
center of Italian national life than to declare Italian a foreign language and then
demonstrate, throughout the novel, how this “official” language is used as a weapon
against them. Of course, Silone was addressing precisely such a “foreign” reading public,
but his claim, in the last instance, of everyone’s right to narrate “i fatti suoi a modo suo”
testifies to his attempt to reappropriate authority from the imperial center even while
using its language.
Interestingly, Levi makes a similar assertion regarding the foreignness of Italian
in Lucania in the Preface of his own novel that seems to echo Silone almost verbatim,
except for one crucial difference in the referent of the first person plural pronoun:
Parliamo un diverso linguaggio: la nostra lingua è qui incomprensibile. I
grandi viaggiatori non sono andati di là dai confini del proprio mondo; e
hanno percorso i sentieri della propria anima e quelli del bene e del male,
della moralità e della redenzione [...] Ma in questa terra oscura, senza
peccato e senza redenzione, dove il male non è morale, ma è un dolore

90
 The linguistic politics that accompanied the advancement of one “standard” Italian language to
the detriment of all other languages spoken in Italy at the time of national unification is referred to as the
“language question.” Historical linguist Tullio De Mauro provides a comprehensive history of the language
question inStoria linguistica dell’Italia unita (Bari: Laterza, 1986). Peter Ives also assesses the weight of
the language question in Italian cultural politics and in the thought of Antonio Gramsci in hisLanguage
and Hegemony in Gramsci (London: Pluto Press, 2004).

The two authors’ use of the pronounnoi (“we”) is key here. While for Silone
“we” refers to the peasants and himself, bound together by birth, culture, and language,
for Levi the “we” unites him (and puts him on the same side of History as) the foreign
conqueror. Furthermore, while Silone uses the plural pronoun to speak for a community
(“noi pensavamo ...” , “noi lo ringraziammo” and so on), Levi narrates only in the first
person singular, so that his uncharacteristic use of the plural here is even more striking.
By extension, then, when Silone speaks of “i miei cafoni,” he is referring to the
community of which he is a part. Levi, on the other hand, is, as we have seen, the super-
protagonist of the world he describes, so that when, echoing Silone, he refers to “i miei
contadini,” it serves not to refer to equal members of a shared community but rather to
pieces of property, much in the same manner that the colonizer refers to “his” subjects.
We have already discussed the colonizer’s terror of and yet necessity for the
resemblance of the other. As long as this ambivalence forms a continuous movement
between “the twin figures of narcissism and paranoia that repeat furiously,
uncontrollably,”
93
 it allows for the production of authority. However, once the act of
writing stops and the text comes to an end, this slippage can no longer be produced,
revealing the limits of the text. However, another text may provide the chance to reassert
this authority once more. Levi was presented with such an occasion with the work of
Rocco Scotellaro.
Carlo Levi and Rocco Scotellaro
With the war over and his novel published, Levi returned to Lucania in 1946,
where he made another “shocking” encounter. The visit was not meant as a mere
nostalgic exercise: Levi had decided to run for election in both the Bari-Foggia and the
Potenza-Matera electoral colleges. Along with other meridionalisti such as Guido Dorso,
Tommaso Fiore, and Manlio Rossi Doria, he ran in the Alleanza Repubblicana party for a
seat on the Constituent Assembly in the referendum election that determined Italy’s
transition from a Monarchy to a Republic.
94
 During his campaign tour, Levi took the
opportunity to revisit many of the Lucanian towns he had described in his novel,
including Matera, Grassano and Aliano (the “Gagliano” of the novel), where he had spent
8 months in exile.
This visit proved to be a disappointment of Levi’s expectations on various levels.
To begin with, he was not well received by many of the locals who not only had read his
book but contested its negative portrayal of their region and people. In Matera, he asked
for local votes in appreciation of the fame he had brought to the region through his novel,
concluding his political rally with the phrase, “Ho parlato di voi al mondo, ora sono

95
 In Grassano one man threatened to kill him if he
ever set foot in the town again. Things hardly went better in Aliano, where Levi had spent
the bulk of his exile, and where most of the novel was set. Here, Levi made the unwise
choice of holding a political rally from a balcony on the main square. In his novel, he had
deprecated this practice as a pompous display of fascist power that failed to impress the
local peasant population. Indeed, despite the fact that it was a Sunday afternoon, the
square was practically deserted and a few of those present whistled and booed him.
96
Carlo Levi the writer – and now aspiring politician – could hardly claim the worshiping
subjects he had fabricated for Don Carlo in the novel.
But nothing could have prepared him for the encounter that awaited him in the
town of Tricarico. Levi still maintained, years later, that at the time of his first return to
Lucania no substantial change in the peasant way of life had yet to occur there. Yet
beginning in 1942, while still under Fascist rule and before Levi began writing hisCristo,
the South, including Lucania, had been rocked by a series of peasant revolts and land
occupations.
97
 One of the leaders of this movement was Rocco Scotellaro, the young
Socialist poet-mayor of Tricarico, who at the time of his election and first meeting with
Levi was 23 years old. The son of a returned emigrant and cobbler, Scotellaro had
become an activist in the local Socialist Party a few years earlier and had taken part in the
peasant land occupations.While Levi had been writing his novel of peasant resignation,
the subjects of his narrative had been occupying land and electing one of the first
Socialist mayors of postwar Italy. Among Scotellaro’s chief accomplishments during his
short tenure were the paving of Tricarico’s roadway and the construction of an important
and badly needed hospital.
98
 There before Levi stood shattering proof that the thesis of
his bestselling novel was a lie.

 I have drawn most of Rocco Scotellaro’s biographical information from Nicola Tranfaglia’s
“Introduction” to the 2006 Laterza joint edition ofL’uva puttanella. Contadini del Sud. Perhaps because
Scotellaro’s own autobiography,L’uva puttanella,was published soon after his death, and perhaps because
Scotellaro’s winning the prestigious Viareggio Prize in 1954 for his collection of poems,È fatto giorno,
provoked the acrimoneous debate known as the “caso Scotellaro,” there seems to be no comprehensive
biography on Rocco Scotellaro that is not at the same time, and perhaps foremost, a critical analysis of his
literary work or an abridgment of the various positions within the “caso Scotellaro.” Among the critical
analyses, see Laura Parola Sarti,Invito alla lettura di Rocco Scotellaro (Milano: Mursia, 1992); Manlio
Rossi-Doria, ed.,Il sindaco poeta di tricarico (Rome, Matera: Basilicata Editrice, 1974); Pompeo
Giannantonio,Rocco Scotellaro (Milano: Mursia: 1986); and the interpretive study provided by Giovanni
Battista Bronzini,L’universo contadino e l’immaginario poetico di Rocco Scotellaro (Bari: Edizioni
Dedalo, 1987), which also presents an exegesis of Scotellaro’s symbolism and a transcription of previously
unpublished material of Scotellaro’s, such as folk songs and tales. For a critical bibliography, refer to
Franco Vitelli’sBibliografia critica su Scotellaro (Matera: Basilicata Editrice, 1977).

Levi lost the election in both colleges, but in the following years he developed a
strong bond of friendship and professional admiration for Scotellaro. When in 1950
Scotellaro, a thorn in the side of local authorities (then still predominantly Fascist), was
unjustly accused of corruption and jailed, no one fought harder than Levi for his acquittal
and release. During his 40 days of incarceration, Scotellaro readCristo si e` fermato a
Eboli to his fellow inmates, an event he later recounted in his autobiographyL’uva
puttanella. And it is precisely theintertextual relationship between Levi and Scotellaro
that proves most interesting for our discussion here, for the interpretation of the works of
Scotellaro after the young poet’s death in 1953 presented Levi with an opportunity to
react to the challenge posed to his authority by those same texts. Levi’s construal of
Scotellaro’s work became a post-Cristo strategy for recapturing the authority to “rule
over” the South in a time of major social turmoil in the region.
When Scotellaro died suddenly at the age of 30, most of his works lay incomplete
and unpublished. With the exception of a few single poems that had already been
published and of collections of poems published in the 1970s and early 1980s, the bulk of
Scotellaro’s works were published within a couple of years of his death. Among these, a
study of the agrarian economy of the South, published in 1954 with the titleContadini del
Sud (“Farmers of the South”), was prefaced by Manlio Rossi Doria, a key figure of
Leftist Meridionalismo and at the time Scotellaro’s professor at the Institute of Agrarian
Economy in Portici, where Scotellaro had gone after abandoning politics in 1950. This
first edition, which introduced Scotellaro to Italian readers for the first time, bore on its
front cover not a photograph of Scotellaro but a portrait of him painted by Carlo Levi.
Thus, even upon this work, which of all of Scotellaro’s works was the least to be
impacted by Levi’s influence, was in a sense “framed” by Levi’s gaze. However, the two
other significant works of Scotellaro bore a much more direct involvement on the part of
Levi. In 1954 Mondadori published a collection of Scotellaro’s poems (selected by Levi
out of over four hundred poems in his possession) under the title of the most famous of
these,E` fatto giorno (translated into English under the titleThe Sky With Its Mouth Wide
Open
99
, but literally meaning “The day has come”), subsequently awarded the Pellegrino
and Viareggio prizes, while the following year, in 1955, Laterza published Scotellaro’s
autobiography,L’uva puttanella (“The Bloody Grapes”). Both of these works were
prefaced by Carlo Levi, and the front cover of the autobiography also bore a portrait by
Levi. However, this is not a portrait of Scotellaro but a portrait of  a young Lucanian
mother and her little boy, once again enclosing Scotellaro’s autobiographical writing
within Levi’s own gaze. This gesture could be interpreted as a sign of fear of
resemblance, for Levi had in fact once referred to portraiture as a confirmation of the
“resemblance” between the painter and his subject:
Si usa dire che le figure dipinte non soltanto, come è naturale,
rispecchiano lo stile, la forma, il gesto, il carattere del pittore, ma che gli
assomigliano, come se egli andasse negli altri cercando e rintracciando se
stesso, e di se stesso proprio le fattezze [...] il ritratto e l'immagine
dell'altro come se stesso.”

26
In his autobiography, Scotellaro had referred to his friendship with Levi as “un amore
della propria somiglianza.”
101
 Levi’s negation of this “terrifying resemblance” serves to
remove the partial presence from the space of the canvas, the page and the nation.
Perhaps it was a resistance to her own invalidation that led Giulia “the witch,” Levi’s
servant in theCristo, to refuse to have her portrait painted by Levi, rather than, as Levi
naturally assumed, primitive superstition.
102
Though I will only discuss Levi’s Prefaces ofÈ fatto giorno andL’uva puttanella
it is worth mentioning thatContadini del Sud, part of a larger project that Scotellaro was
not able to complete, is in itself a fascinating counter-argument to the Southern passivity
thesis propounded by Levi. Composed of a series of interviews Scotellaro conducted of
agricultural laborers across the South, it demonstrates a vitality of thought and action and
a depth of consciousness in the peasantry that finds no parallel in Levi’s petrified
characters. WithÈ fatto giorno andL’uva puttanella, this complexity of experience
naturally bears a more personal stamp. The poems inÈ fatto giorno, including the
homonymous poem, do not speak only of the oppression of the peasants but also of their
resistance to it. In some of these, such as “È fatto giorno,” this resistance appears like a
menacing announcement:
È fatto giorno, siamo entrati in giuoco anche noi
Con i panni e le scarpe e le facce che avevamo [...] (È fatto giorno, no date)
La stagione che alimenta
l’orgasmo tutto nostro è questa: [...]
Gridano al Co mune di vo lere
il tozzo di pane e una giornata
e scarpe e strade e tutto.
E ci mettiamo a maledire insieme,
il sindaco e le rondini e le donne,
e il nostro urlo si fa piú forte [...] (E ci mettiamo a maledire insieme, 1947)
Ma nei sentieri non si torna indietro.
Altre ali fuggiranno
dalle paglie della cova,
perché lungo il perire dei tempi
l’alba è nuova, è nuova. (Sempre nuova  è l’alba, no date)
The titles alone of these poems are suggestive of Scotellaro’s faith and dedication to
radical political activism. Many of these poems are narratives of rebellion, the voices of
the exploited raised to curse, not bless, their oppressors.
Levi’s Preface to these poems functions to reaffirm his own authority by un-
authorizing Scotellaro. He begins by distinguishing between poems written before 1946,
the year in which Scotellaro became mayor, and those written after. According to Levi,
the form with which Scotellaro wrote the earlier poems could only have been “borrowed”
(“presa a prestito”), meaning that Scotellaro had yet to form an autochthonous writing

27
style.
103
 But with the war over, the “indeterminate adolescence” of Scotellaroand “his
world” comes to an end. Levi portrays 1946 as a new beginning, both for Scotellaro as a
man and for the South as a historical subject:
[I]l   Mezzogiorno   pare   si   sia   destato   da   un   lunghissimo   sonno,   è
cominciato  il  moto  contadino,  che  è  l’affermazione  dell’esistenza  di  un
popolo intero. In questo popolo risvegliato per la prima volta, per la prima
volta vivente e protagonista della propria storia [...] Rocco vive la propria
giovane  vita  [...]  perché  il  suo  sviluppo  di  uomo  è  tutt’uno  con  il  nuovo
germogliare di quel popolo contadino.
104
Here Levi carries out his customary practice of placing the South in a historical vacuum,
ignoring the long list of historical precedents of peasant uprisings in the South. Instead,
Levi describes this South as somehow “awakening” and “coming alive” for the first time
in 1946. By the following paragraph, there is a strong indication that Levi is positioning
himself as the author of this presumed “great awakening.” 1946 is also the year of Levi’s
first encounter with Scotellaro, and, as it soon becomes clear, it isthis event that forms, in
Levi’s mind, the crux that births both Scotellaro and the new South:
(Risale  a  quel  tempo,  a  maggio  del  ’46,  il  nostro  primo  incontro
[...]  che  forse  contribuì  [...]  alla  sua  presa  di  coscienza  del  mondo
contadino  di  cui  faceva  parte,  e  al  suo  guardarlo  per  la  prima  volta  con
distacco  e  amore,  al  suo  farne  poesia,  attraverso  un  linguaggio  libero,
personale, non letterario.)
Questa sua maturazione e liberazione nell’azione (un ospedale, una
strada,  una  occupazione  di  terre,  una  discussione  sindacale,  sono,  in  un
mondo  nuovo,  profonde  verità  poetiche)  creano  il  grande  periodo  della
poesia di Rocco del ’47-’48.
105
It now appears as though it is Scotellaro’s encounter with Levi, and not his own personal
experiences and political formation, that for the first time gives the young revolutionary
the critical ability to really see (and love, even) his own land and people. It is this
encounter that “matures” the poet and “liberates” the southern people, allowing for the
construction of a hospital, the paving of a road, the land occupations, and other important
battles. In keeping with his role as creator of Lucania already established inCristo si e`
fermato a Eboli, Levi thus establishes himself as the architect of this “new” world as
well.
Just as Levi’sCristo had not found unanimous approval, so too did Levi’s first
appropriation of Scotellaro stir an acrimonious controversy that lasted for decades, the
so-called “caso Scotellaro.” Though a divergence of appreciation and judgments had
developed around the figure and works of Scotellaro after his death, the controversy was
more broadly po lit ical and cultural than strict ly literary.
What had intervened, between the end of the war and the publication of
Scotellaro’s works in the mid 1950s, was the publication in Italy of Antonio Gramsci’s
Prison Notebooks begun in 1947. Discussions over the role of intellectuals in the
organization of culture irrupted to the forefront of Leftist debates in every sphere of

28
cultural and political life, including the “caso Scotellaro,” which became a platform from
which to launch the significance of Scotellaro’soeuvre – and its Levian interpretation –
for the Southern Question. In more general terms, the Scotellaro case pointed to the need
to identify, or redefine, the revolutionary subject in post-Resistance Italy. The war had
drawn to a close, and with that closure also came the end of the heroic deeds of the
Resistance. Delineating a cultural strategy now entailed paying particular attention to
oppressed social groups or classes previously ignored or disenfranchised. Aside from the
proletariat, this meant especially the peasantry and the emigrants of the South. It is
around interest in such groups and alliances as agents of social transformation in the Italy
of the 1950s that the “caso Scotellaro” exploded. Were peasants and emigrants
potentially revolutionary subjects? What sorts of changes were they bringing about in
national culture and consciousness? Was their hitherto marginalized culture capable of
speaking to broader social and political struggles? More broadly, what was to be the role
of the South in the social and political renewal of the nation? And what was to be the task
of the “organic intellectual” in all this? These were the questions that arose in the
intellectual debates of those years that involved not only chief figures of the literary
world but also filmmakers, philosophers, anthropologists, politicians, economists. The
“caso Scotellaro” thus provides a cross section of the socio-cultural strategies of the
Italian Left in the 1950s and affords a view of its chief concerns over the struggles still
ahead. Nor were such debates settled in any way then or in successive decades, when the
Scotellaro case would periodically reemerge like an instrument of reassessment, as it did
with the 1960 release of Luchino Visconti’s film,Rocco e i suoi fratelli, the subject of the
last chapter.
The occasion in which the “caso Scotellaro” erupted within leftist circles was a
convention held in Matera in 1955 titled “Rocco Scotellaro, intellettuale del
Mezzogiorno.” The previous year, Rocco Scotellaro’s collection of poems,È fatto
giorno, had won the Viareggio Prize. More than the lyrical quality of Scotellaro’s poetry,
what was at issue was the political relevance of Scotellaro’s work in the postwar South.
Southernist exponents of the Communist Party, like  Mario Alicata, Carlo Salinari, Carlo
Muscetta and Giorgio Napolitano, argued that, under the influence of Carlo Levi and
Manlio Rossi-Doria, Scotellaro had produced an anti-Gramscian“aestheticized
primitivism” of the South that separated peasant culture from the rest of southern Italian
(and Italian) society and placed it at a historical standstill. Both Levi and Scotellaro,
according to Alicata, had misunderstood the fundamental teachings of Gramsci about the
Southern Question and cultural change. Scotellaro had neglected to construct a vision of
cultural renewal in the South, and he, like Levi, had failed to understand the necessity for
the southern peasantry to form with the northern proletariat an alliance that alone could
transform structures of oppression. In the words of Pino Iorio,“le carenze del lucano, in
sede politica, riflettono il mito, sentimentale e perciò forse un po’ romantico, d’un mondo
agreste, nel Mezzogiorno, rassegnato ed immobile, segnale d’autonoma civiltà.”
106
The Socialist Pietro Nenni defended Scotellaro’s work by describing it as still
permeated more by a sense of hope than of resignation, and by accusing the Communists
of being resentful of representations of social groups that traditionally had not been led
by the Italian Communist Party. Ultimately, the“caso Scotellaro” marked a rupture
106

29
within Leftist politics (between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party) on the
appropriate political agenda for the South.
107
Naturally, the debate over the significance of Scotellaro’s legacy regarded Levi’s
Cristo si e` fermato a Eboli very closely, so it is no coincidence that the first, and most
memorable, response to Levi’s interpretation of Scotellaro, penned by Mario Alicata, was
titled, “Il Meridionalismo non si puo` fermare a Eboli” (“‘Meridionalismo’” Cannot Stop
at Eboli,” 1954). Though he does not explicitly define Levi’s novel an imperialist work,
Alicata nonetheless sharply condemns the novel on the grounds of its negative impact on
the emancipation of the South from structures of oppression. To begin with, Alicata took
issue with the othering of the South as a mysterious, ineffable “essence.” Paraphrasing
Gramsci, Alicata condemns Levi’s “orientalization” of the South as an aesthetically
astute but politically sterile maneuver: the return to an interest in the South, he explained,
had unfortunately been accompanied by the less legitimate tendency to consider the
South “come un enigma ancora da decifrare, come una terra arcana e misteriosa ancora
tutta da studiare e tutta da rivelare nella sua ‘essenza’ nascosta e nelle sue ‘apparenze’
molteplici, insomma, per usare una efficacissima immagine di Gramsci, come un lontano
‘Giappone’, del quale basta occuparsi con accenti di umana simpatia.”
108
In dominant Italian culture, Alicata proceeded, everything had been produced and
organized to attenuate, marginalize, and even conceal, in the North but especially in the
South, the true substance of the Southern Question, while at the same time also drawing
from the South what was no doubt the richest discursive thread in modern Italian culture
and thought.
109
 Precisely because this rich tradition had ensured the success of Levi’s
novel, Levi had every reason to reproduce that discourse which tended to obscure rather
than reveal true relations of power behind the disadvantaged position of the South.
The danger of portraying the South as a mystified, obscure subject, Alicata continued,
was that this confusion was carried over into political life. The task of critical scholarship
was to demystify the problems of the South, which required going beyond simply
denouncing the way things were to explaining important questions of history, politics and
economy in order to delineate the way things should become.
According to Alicata, this was the central problem with Carlo Levi’s stamp of
‘meridionalismo,’ especially as articulated in hisCristo, and within which Levi was
attempting to collapse the legacy of Scotellaro. The Levian stamp of “meridionalismo,”
Alicata accused, would have liked not only for Christ but for critical thought in general to
have stopped at Eboli. Alicata’s acute analysis saw in theCristo more than just an
expression of Levi’s personal philosophy, recognizing instead the articulation of a whole
discourse common among the intellectuals of the bourgeoisie, both North and South, and

now part of the dominant national culture.
110
 Unfortunately, the thesis of the South’s
“immobility” and “eternal primitivism” was conveniently adopted and reproduced by
conservative political factions resistant to sweeping social change in the South, so that
Levi’s novel served to justify the perpetuation of the North-South relationship of
inequality and dependence.
 The legacy of Rocco Scotellaro, Alicata concluded, deserved to reflect the much
richer and more complex mixture of intellectual influences, of Levi, Dorso and Rossi
Doria but also of Gramsci and of Scotellaro’s own political militancy in the Italian
Socialist Party.
111
 Many of Scotellaro’s writings testify to his tribulations as a young
southern intellectual confronted with the teachings of a national political ideology often
difficult to adopt or translate into his local culture, which was neither “pre-Christian” nor
“Christian” but “Socialist.”
112
 This, Alicata insisted, was a more realistic interpretation of
Scotellaro’s legacy than the “excessive,” and perhaps interested, adoration displayed by
Levi. Criticizing Levi’s authorship of Scotellaro’s “presa di coscienza,” Alicata accused
Levi of having built “for himself and for others” a myth around the young poet’s figure
that amounted to a “new chapter” of hisCristo – a veiled accusation that  Levi had
aggrandized his own figure through the appropriation of Scotellaro.
Levi’s chance to defend himself against these accusations presented itself with his
writing the Preface to Scotellaro’sL’uva puttanella, the following year. His reply to
Alicata and the other Marxists consisted in denying that political economic analyses can
enact transformative processes. Moreover, his novel could never have been “realistic”
because his experience of confino itself was not realistic, as were not (incredibly) the
peasants’ oppression, hunger, poverty and malaria. Levi’s tribute to history didn’t go past
attributing the isolation of the South to a vague “centuries-old historical relationship that
has kept peasants in the margins of national life, and that has pushed them outside of real
history.”
113
 However, Levi in no way acknowledges his own role in having pushed them
outside of history.
Part personal defense, part ingenious appropriation, Levi’s preface ofL’uva
puttanella is a much more complex text to examine in terms of what it accomplishes, nor
is this surprising given that the autobiography at hand was a multifaceted work of
postcolonial writing. Consisting mainly of various fragmentary notes and sketches
compounded by a series of letters written to friends and publishers, it reflects Scotellaro’s
innovative approach to writing that went against the canonical forms and values of the
dominant literary culture. In a letter written the day before his death, Scotellaro referred
to it as “the novel I will not finish;”
114
 while to his editor he had once declared, “you will
never find the order that is not there, nor have I ever wished for my things to have
order.”
115
 As though pointing to his own act of creating Scotellaro, of which the portrait on
the cover is a reminder, Levi reaffirms the “birth” of Scotellaro’s world and its self-
awareness: “Qui vive il mondo contadino nella sua nascita difficile e dolorosa.”

returns repeatedly to this moment of birth of a peasant world heretofore dead to

“[Q]uel mondo senza storia, non era un idolo mentale ma un punto di partenza tuttavia
presente [...] [L]’uva puttanella è il mondo contadino che per la prima volta si muove,

118
 What’s more, this history-just-begun, a
tabula-rasa somehow rife with novel struggles, is the result not of social-structural
changes but of the moral and psychological traits of extraordinary individuals such as
Rocco Scotellaro “who allow, for the first time, the peasant to think.”
119
 However, though
Scotellaro is celebrated as an “extraordinary” individual, his position as author is
gradually undermined. There is reason to doubt that Levi is not reflecting only on
Scotellaro’s life and work when he asks, “Che cosa è l’autorità? Che cosa è
l’organizzazione? Che cosa è il potere sugli uomini?”
120
Positioning himself as author of Scotellaro’s “maturity” and “inspiration” serves
to reclaim power over the colonial other’s writing and to rearticulate it as his own,
thereby granting himself the power to “liberate” the South. The weakening of
Scotellaro’s authority in fact first appears as a relationship of mentoring and
encouragement: “Rocco venne un giorno da me, nell’estate del ’50 [...] e mi lesse con
molta trepidazione i primi quattro capitoli. Li trovai splendidi e originali, e non gli
nascosi il mio entusiasmo: lo lodai anzi tanto che quello spirito sensibilissimo e delicato
ne fu indotto, quasi per un eccesso di senso di responsabilità letteraria, a sospendere per
qualche tempo il lavoro [di sindaco].”
121
 Levi thus suggests he induced Scotellaro’s
literary career.
 In describing the work’s project from notes and outlines in his possession, Levi
again removes Scotellaro from a position of authorship: “Ma già il piano dell’opera si
allargava [...] Di schemi dell’opera, che non fu poi mai scritta, se ne trovano molti tra le
sue carte. Il libro doveva dapprincipio essere diviso in tre parti, poi in quattro e infine in
cinque; la collocazione degli episodi variava nei diversi prospetti, come il loro numero; i
personaggi, dapprima pochi, crescevano, negli elenchi, fino a lunghissime liste di pagine
e pagine.”
122
  Levi’s selection of this outline, among many, is significant: “Parte prima.
Dimissioni spiegate: sfiducia nell’autorità:l’autorità non sarebbe mai stata nostra. Parte
seconda. Il carcere, gli uomini non fanno mai comunione. Parte terza. La libertà. I grandi
ideali di fraternità e di giustizia dipendono da almeno due uomini.”
123
 This select ion is
crucial because it both justifies and forms an outline of sorts of Levi’s own creation of the
South: first, there is the establishment of the peasants’ (and Scotellaro’s) lack of authority
and substitution with Levi’s own text on Lucania; secondly, there is the confinement of
Lucania in a closed enclave that takes power of movement and of change away from it;
and thirdly, the confirmation from Scotellaro that the “liberation” of the South depended
on an intertextual relationship between himself and Levi.
But the problem posed by Scotellaro’s writing remains: it constitutes a partial
presence in the writing of the nation that forces the rearticulation of its identity, alienating

32
it from its “whole” essence. Scotellaro’s testimony was not circumscribed to Lucania or
the South but broke through the Levian border to encompass the entire nation, of which
the South was an equal, constitutive component. Significantly, the passage that gives
L’uva puttanella its title, is the one that describes this new relation of the South to the rest
of Italy: “L’ordine che non c’è non lo troverete come appunto è nel grappolo d’uva che
gli acini sono di diversa grandezza anche a voler usare la più accurata sgramolatura.
Questi sono acini piccoli, apireni, seppure maturi,che andranno ugualmente nella tina
del mosto il giorno della vendemmia. Cosìil mio paese fa parte dell’Italia. Io e il mio
paese meridionale siamo l’uva puttanella, piccola e matura nel grappolo per dare il poco
succo che abbiamo.”
124
If Silone’sFontamara served a function that was metaphorical, in the sense that
the peasants stood for all the colonized, Scotellaro’sL’uva puttanella accomplished a
much more terrifying feat, from the colonizer’s point of view, for its function was
metonymical, in that the South was included as an integral part of the nation. This
function is not fulfilled only by the content of the text, by what is stated about the
“bloody grapes,” but also by the language used to express this South. Differently from
Silone, Scotellaro does not write in standard Italian. Though he also does not use dialect,
which would have been incomprehensible to the majority of Italian readers, Scotellaro
expresses himself in a vernacular hybrid infused with the rhythm and lexicon of the
Tricarico dialect.
125
Scotellaro’s chief aim, however, is not universal comprehensibility. Through a
series of linguistic strategies, Scotellaro seeks to abrogate the language of the canon and
to change it. At the lexical level, there are some words drawn from the dialect of
Tricarico, but the text is rich mostly with colloquial expressions that place together words
in combinations unfamiliar to most readers, such as “in prima” for “prima di tutto,” and
“mi dette la voce” for “mi parlò.”
126
 The scarce punctuation also serves to give a faster
rhythm different from that of the travelogue’s contemplative gaze. Sentences are often
separated with commas rather than periods: “Con questa borsa, se non partivo, dovevo
apparire stravagante, io stesso credevo di sapere le loro supposizioni e i commenti, altre
cose pensavo da me;”
127
 or begin with a “che” unrelated to the previous clause: “Ma le
mie parole non gli giungevano, tra il tanfo e il vento del telefono, che lui continuava a
dire: - Alla Stazione?”
128
 At other times, the clauses alternate confusingly rather than
following a linear logic: “Erano ora rimasti il filo di ferro tra le canne e le lamiere, nudo e
arruginito, e sarmenti secchi nella rotonda.”
129
 The “nudo e arruginito” refers to the “filo
di ferro,” but it is placed after the “canne e lamiere.” The stringing together of clauses
also results in the subject of the sentence changing suddenly: “Ci chiamavano ai funerali
in citta`, puliti con le candele in mano recitando le preghiere.”
130
 Similarly, Scotellaro
often upsets the subject-verb agreement: “La vigna non era stata ancora zappata, aveva

ragione il padre a predire che, morto lui, i figli saremmo stati dei vermi.”
131
 At other
times, he mixes verb tenses: “Mi succedevano tanti fatti, e la decisione di abbandonare il
mio posto era stata così necessaria che mi pareva [...]”. The frequent use of the imperfect
tense may be an indication of a strong oral narrative tradition still very present in the
writing style. However, the mixing of verb tenses, the offsetting of clauses and subject-
verb relations all indicate a general disruption of the cause-effect order governing the
linguistic and literary practices of the dominant culture. Hence Scotellaro’s warning to
his editors, “L’ordine che non c’è, non lo troverete mai, né io ho voluto le mie cose con
ordine,” a wish further reflected in the non-linear temporal structure of the narrative in
his autobiography.
Beyond the technical function of these figurative devices to convey the lifeworld
of the indigenous population, they fulfill above all a political function insofar as they
relate to the exercise of power. The unusual stylistics of Scotellaro’s writing are a
metonymic act: if the foreign reader must slow down and make an effort to understand
the language being used and the culture being described, the differences in the text serve
to prevent that the word of the other be simply absorbed and annulled. These linguistic
choices thus stand as markers of the authority that Scotellaro reclaims for himself and for
the southern “bloody grapes” as a whole, making this a post-colonial text par excellence.
The metonymic aspect ofL’uva puttanella threatened to tear down of the wall
Levi had so laboriously erected between nation and colony, shattering the always already
shaky standing of the colonizer. As his Preface to that work draws to a close, we can feel
Levi intensifying his efforts. After remembering his first encounter with the young poet-
mayor in 1946, “Arrivato sulla piazza di Tricarico, mi venne incontro un giovane,
piccolo, biondo, dal viso lentigginoso, che sembrava un bambino: era Rocco, che mi si
avvicinò col viso aperto dell’amicizia”,
132
 Levi recalls his return to Grassano,where three
days earlier he had been chased out of town, and suddenly, “la situazione, di per sé, si era
capovolta, e tutto il paese attendeva in piazza, impaziente e consapevole, una parola di
libertà.”
133
 The “word” that Levi authored was obviously a metaphor for the rise of
Scotellaro as a revolutionary and for the birth of the South as a historical subject, as
confirmed by Levi’s concluding words: “Rocco crebbe coi suoi paesi, dal silenzio
dell’infanziaalla virile parola di oggi [...]   Un mondo è cambiato, e, nei suoi paesi,
porta il segno della sua opera. Un mondo è nato all’esistenza, ha imparato a parlare [...]
Altriha forse dato a questo mondo, per amorosa intuizione,una parola, un impulso, una
rivelazione di se stesso, una coscienza insieme poetica e attiva. Ma Rocco Scotellaro è la
prima grande voce che nasce dal suo interno, dalla sua umile vita nascosta.”
134
 The mere
existence of a colonial other who responds with equal pressure is so shocking for Levi,
and the resemblance so terrifying, that he claims only for himself the power to give it the
“word.”
Conclusion
It was Levi who took charge of erecting Scotellaro’s funerary monument and,
against the wishes of some of the locals, assigned its design to an architectural firm from

34
Milan.
135
 The monument manages to embody to an extraordinary degree all the
contradictoriness of Levi’s relationship with the dead poet: in jarring contrast to the local
architecture, it is an imposing, austere wall made of gray block stones and enclosing in its
center a narrow opening that allows a tapered view of the valley of Basento to the East,
which the monument in part obstructs. Engraved on one of the stones is the last stanza
from Scotellaro’s poem,Sempre nuova e` l’alba.Levi also took it upon himself to place a
memorial plaque outside Scotellaro’s house that reads, “il poeta della liberta`
contadina.”
136
 In recalling his involvement in its placement, Levi makes a remarkable
choice of words: he did not have the memorial plaque erected, placed, installed or even
affixed, but rather “murato” (“immured,” “walled-in”).
137
 While in Italian “murare” may
also mean to affix an object to a wall, its primary meaning is to “wall in.” Levi’s
immuration of Scotellaro, like that of the colony, was the quintessential gesture of
colonial ambivalence. In its frantic race between “narcissism and paranoia,” between
Scotellaro’s skeptical admonition that “nessuno puo` rivivere con la sua scrittura. Tutti
restano nella nicchia d’aria che muovono,”
138
 and his revolutionary warning that “Altre
ali fuggiranno / dalle paglie della cova / perché [...]  / l’alba è nuova, è nuova,” Levi’s
script obsessively conjures and interdicts the terrifying presence.

CHAPTER 2
THE WAY WE NEVER WERE: FASCISM AND ABSOLUTION IN NEOREALIST
EMIGRATION NARRATIVES
Building a strong national identity was not a preoccupation exclusive to the
Fascist regime but was pervasive of Italian politics and culture in the postwar period as
well. A combination of factors had produced one of the most severe crises in Italian
national identity since the nation’s founding. Aside from regional divisions that had
historically inhibited the formation of national cohesion, the experience of the war, then
civil war, the fall of Fascism, and foreign occupation, all converged to place enormous
strain on Italians’ already tenuous identification with their nation. Carlo Levi’sCristo si
e` fermato a Eboli, discussed in the previous chapter, was seminal in re-signifying Italian
national identity in the shaky transition from war to liberation by re-consolidating
national space around the imaginary boundaries enclosing Italy’s first colony, the South.
But the process of imagining the nation can also involve movement across categories that
are temporal rather than spatial. Communal identities such as those of nationhood are
almost always shaped by collective memory, through the “recollection” of a shared past.
Thus, if Levi had traveled through a dimension that was largely temporal in order to
delineate a spatial separation between the nation and its double, other cultural
representations in the aftermath of the war moved over space to accentuate a difference
that was at once temporal and moral, between a virtuous postwar now and a corrupt
Fascist then. The postwar reconstruction of Italy thus erupted as a moral problem as
much as a material and political one. “Reconstruction” therefore also entailed producing
interpretations of the recent past capable of shaping Italians’ memories of their
involvement with Fascism. The once disparaged figure of the emigrant was revisited,
becoming a central figure in the movement across the moral map of the nation. This
chapter will examine how reconstruction-era portrayals of emigration, such as Mario
Soldat i’sFuga in Francia (1948) and Aldo Fabrizi’sEmigrantes (1949), employed the
topos of emigration to construct a narrative of redemption capable of creating a “new”
Italy with a clean conscience. The comparative and contextual analysis of these films will
moreover reveal the center-Right’s “transformist” exploitation of neorealism as part of its
attempt to restore a conservative cultural-political hegemony.

36
The “So lut ion” of Emigrat ion
The centrality of the topic of emigration in the political and economic discourses
surrounding reconstruction was motivated by the resumption of emigration on a massive
scale after the war. During the Fascist regime, Italians had been prohibited from
emigrating by a 1939 law aimed at preventing internal migration and urbanization while
encouraging military conscription and the colonization of Africa.
1
 However, the ban had
not stopped large numbers of Italians from continuing to cross the nation’s borders
illegally each year in search of work or political asylum. With the fall of the regime and
the end of the war, emigration resumed the massive proportions it had reached in the
interwar period. Aside from its more sustained dimension with respect to emigration at
the turn of the century
2
, postwar emigration differed from its previous episodes by
destination. Of the 1.1 million Italians who emigrated “officially”
3
 between 1946 and
1950, more than half went to European destinations, a tendency that only strengthened
with time, until Europe came to absorb around 85% of Italy’s migrant labor force during
the economic miracle.
4
 This choice was not always spontaneously determined by the
emigrants themselves, many of whom would still have chosen the Americas, but was
contingent upon a series of factors, chief among which were the accords drawn between
Italian postwar governments and other nations. The project to render Italy’s workforce
more “flexible,” for instance, was conceived as a necessary component of the fledgling
European common market and met the favor of American military and industrial
planning intent on preventing the rise of Communist sympathies among the poorest
sectors of the Italian population, particularly in the South. As a result, Italy’s emigration
politics became a point of intersection for Italian, European, and American politico-
economic interests in the shadow of the Cold War. Not surprisingly, then, the third – and
most significant – aspect to distinguish postwar emigration from its previous stages was
the unprecedented involvement of the Italian government in an official capacity in
actively encouraging, selecting, recruiting, and generally directing the emigration of its
(predominantly male) workforce through an “assisted emigration” program.
1
 With respect to internal migration, the ban was not repealed until 1961. For more on this, see
Chapter 3.
2
 Even at the height of postwar emigration, during the economic boom of the late 1950s and early
1960s, some 1.6 million Italians expatriated compared to 3.3 million between 1906-1910.
3
 Not included in these “official” figures are seasonal forms of emigrant labor, particularly strong
in the case of France and Switzerland, which could last from a few weeks to several months. Also excluded
from these statistics are figures relating to “clandestine” emigration, which continued to be quite strong
even after Italy’s introduction of the “assisted emigration” program, and which for obvious reasons
remained extremely difficult to document. Compounding this problem was the ISTAT’s tardy attention to
emigration to European destinations, which it did not begin to record  until after 1953. However, inLavoro
in movimento. L’emigrazione italiana in Europa 1945-57 (Roma: Donzelli Editore, 2008), Michele Colucci
estimates that in the case of France alone, where Italian clandestine emigration was perhaps the highest, the
numbers were in the tens of thousands each year. Paul Ginsborg cites a separate survey conducted by the
University of Naples that found that “between 1951 and 1971 4,200,000 persons had emigrated from the
South, out of a total population at that time of some eighteen million.” Paul Ginsborg,A History of
Contemporary Italy. Society and Politics 1943-1988 (New York: Palgrave MacMacmillan, 2003), p. 501.
These figures suggest that clandestine emigration was much higher than official estimates revealed.

Storia dell’emigrazione italiana 1, ed. Piero Bevilacqua, Andreina De Clementi, and Emilio Franzina
(Roma: Donzelli Editore, 2001), 50.

37
The coverage of emigration in official and popular channels of communication
was indicative of the nation’s ambivalent approach to the phenomenon: on the one hand,
in theCinegiornali newsreels and other propagandistic material, it represented emigration
as a humanitarian and well-organized program that allowed Italian workers to play an
active role in postwar reconstruction by continuing in their tradition of “building the
world.”
5
 On the other hand, representations of emigration on the silver screen remained
minor when compared to the size and import of the phenomenon itself, and often met
with unofficial ostracism when they portrayed emigration in a critical light. This was the
case with Pietro Germi’s filmIl cammino della speranza (1950), which recounted the
plight of a group of unemployed Sicilians attempting to emigrate illegally into France.
The film was denied designated government funds because it shined an unflattering light
upon Italian emigration policy.
The general discouragement of errant representations of emigration was in large
measure due to the less than conscientious role the State had played in opening a new
season of mass emigration. In both internal and foreign affairs, emigration had presented
itself as a convenient “release valve” once more. With the war still raging, some of the
country’s leading political and industrial exponents – among whom were members of the
northern CLNAI resistance –  began to plan strategically for the resumption of mass
emigration. Foreseeing that Italy would lose the war and anticipating the socio-economic
impact of such a turn of events, they expected two major problems to follow the return
home of Mussolini’s defeated soldiers and colonists: the first was mass unemployment;
the second was a diffuse and dangerous feeling of resentment.
6
Appearing as a solution to a shared set of fears, emigration thus became the target
of a concerted political effort. As early as 1942, with many feeling the end of the war to
be imminent, initiatives were taken across the political spectrum to gear up for peace
accords and then reconstruction. Emigration figured prominently in both these processes.
In a 1942 pamphlet titledLe idee ricostruttive della Democrazia Cristiana, Alcide De
Gasperi, founder of the Christian Democratic Party and prime minister of eight
consecutive coalition governments from 1945 to 1953,  identified emigration as the
necessary precondition for postwar reconstruction; in 1943, Ludovico D’Aragona, of the
Socialist camp, also underscored the importance of relaunching mass emigration, albeit
with the proviso of protecting migrant workers; and in 1944, Ugo La Malfa of the Italian
Republican Party called European emigration the “new solution” to the enduring
Southern Question. He was joined by Guido Dorso, who prophesied that the emigrants’
remittances home would finally turn the Italian South into a “great orchard.”
7
Yet the benefits believed to ensue from the renewal of mass emigration were not
always accompanied by a political strategy that kept in mind the emigrants’ best interests,
and often betrayed an appalling cynicism. Recent archival research has revealed that
already during the war the Italian provisional government initiated bilateral agreements to
prevent the return of thousands of Italian prisoners of war being held in Europe and
Africa, negotiating for their use as cheap labor by the Allied governments holding them

captive.
8
 These early negotiations were not motivated only by Italian fears of being
unable to reabsorb its unemployed masses, though of course this concern would guide
most of Italy’s postwar agreements; nor were the Italians always exchanged for material
goods, as in the case of the 1945-1946 accord with Belgium that traded cheap mining
labor for coal. In the case of the first accord with France, Italy simply “gave away” its
prisoners in exchange for an alleviation of its responsibilities in the war and hence a more
favorable treatment in the upcoming peace accords. Since France was essentially given
carte blanche on their employment, many of the prisoners found themselves coerced into
the French Foreign Legion, fighting France’s colonial wars from Indochina to Algeria.
This early Italo-French agreement is perhaps the most concrete example of the use often
made of Italian emigrants to absolve the nation from the stain of Fascism.
The Privileged Sphere of Cinema
In the years following the war, cinema assumed an increasingly important role in
shaping the socio-cultural behaviors, attitudes, and memories of Italians regarding the
war, the regime, poverty and emigration. This leading role played by cinema, so
fundamental for understanding Italian postwar culture, depended on a series of factors.
Though cinema had occupied a central place in Italian popular culture as early as the
1930s, it was in the 1940s that Italian audiences became the largest in Europe. Between
1938 and 1950, Italian film audiences doubled, and by the mid 1950s, they were going to
the movies more frequently than any other European population.
9
 According to Brunetta,
by 1957 Italy was second in the world only to the United States for number of cinemas
per capita.
10
Secondly, the advent of neorealism was especially significant in making Italian
cinema second in the world after Hollywood. It was with the beginning of neorealism in
1945 that cinema established itself as the art form most closely linked to society,
depicting ordinary subjects and the travails of their everyday lives. As Gundle has
argued, “Italian cinema became a source of recognition and even consolation for millions
of people uprooted or disoriented by a vast and bewildering process of social
transformation. This gave it a cultural function of great significance at a time when
audiences elsewhere were in steep decline.”
11
  By representing problems and classes of
people previously excluded from mainstream representations, neorealism gave renewed
vigor to Italian cinema at a time of great economic hardship. These very characteristics,
however, also served to turn cinema into a crucial battleground for the political and social
conflicts investing the nation after the war.

39
And finally, cinema was itself an instrument of social change, acting as mediator
in the transition from Fascist state to capitalist republic.
12
  The power of film lay in the
fact that it did not just reflect social reality but also helped to shape it in important ways.
The enormity of the emigration phenomenon, for instance, produced a subculture which
was equally significant in shaping Italian society at this time. As Forgacs and Gundle
point out, Italians’ “imagined sense of place” in the postwar years was determined by a
cultural consumption that depended on the movement of both cultural products, of which
cinema is the primary example, and people to other regions or nations. The geographic
and social mobility provided by cinema and migration thus assume a primary role in re-
shaping a devastated national identity after the war, in that “they served, for many people,
particularly working-class people and peasants whose physical mobility was often
limited, to redefine their sense of community by breaking down boundaries and enlarging
their purviews in both a physical and a mental sense.”
13
Defining Neorealism
Neorealism undeniably played the leading role in casting emigration narratives in
such a way as to provide a “solution” to national regeneration. If the primacy of cinema
in shaping Italian postwar culture is unquestionable, the exact nature of neorealism has
been a far more complex and contested issue. What is certain is that the neorealist
movement managed to embody all the major anxieties, novelties and continuities running
through Italian society at this time. In films such as those examined here, neorealism
helped to construct a “new” Italian subject by creating a specific relationship between the
emigrant figure and the temporal emblems of past and future. Haunted by the past yet
seeking and deserving a fresh start, these figures were meant to be representative of the
Italian population at large – honest, hardworking civilians standing at a moral and
historical crossroad – while providing a figurative absolution for Italy’s troubled past.
If Italian neorealist cinema continues to be the object of controversy today, this is
in part due to the fact that its own emergence bore an uncomfortable relationship to that
past. Calling into question the justification for the prefix “neo,” most of the debates have
generally concerned either the aesthetic roots of neorealism in the Fascist film industry or
the (in)adequacy of the movement’s denunciation of Fascism. Hence the positions within
this debate have tended to focus on either “continuity” between the two periods or
“rupture.”
14
 Defining neorealism, then, entails taking a position with respect to whether
postwar culture could rightfully be proclaimed an innovation, aesthetically and morally,

or whether it should be seen as an arena so loaded with Fascist residues as to become a
launching pad for its restoration in the form of neo-Fascism.
Part of the problem with defining neorealism according to a continuity-rupture
dichotomy lies in the loose cohesion among films and filmmakers who often varied
greatly in style, intent, and political conviction. In fact, it was not until 1952, in an essay
titled “Alcune idee sul cinema,” that Cesare Zavattini, the “philosopher” of neorealism,
set out to retroactively define the “rules” of neorealist filmmaking, listing on-location
shooting, long takes, attention to contemporary and realistic subject matter, use of non-
professional actors, open-ended plot, realistic dialogues, and use of vernacular language.
To further complicate matters, the 1970s saw the emergence of revisionist
accounts that challenged received notions about Fascist cinema and raised uncomfortable
questions about its relationship to neorealism. Many of the aesthetic rules of neorealism,
such accounts pointed out, were in fact already observed by the realist cinema of the
1930s, when the well-nurtured cinematicauteurism of theCinema Nuovo group
assembled around Umberto Barbaro had already begun to call for a realistic cinema.
15
Leo Longanesi, a journalist and writer known for his strong support of Fascism, wrote in
1933:
We  should  make  films  that  are  extremely  simple  and  spare  in  staging
without using artificial sets – films that are shot as much as possible from
reality.  In  fact,  realism  is  precisely  what  is  lacking  in  our  films.  It  is
necessary to go right out into the street, to take the movie camera into the
streets, the courtyards, the barracks, and the train stations.
16
Moreover, most of the directors involved in the neorealist movement, including Roberto
Rossellini, who was also one of its founders, had been major exponents of the Fascist
film industry. Rossellini’s inauguration of the neorealist season withRoma citta` aperta
in 1945 andPaisa` in 1946 bore echoes of his prewar fascination with the realist
techniques of filmmaking, such as the use of nonprofessional actors and authentic
outdoor and indoor shooting locations. In addition, his apprenticeship with the regime’s
favorite documentarist, Francesco De Robertis, had taught him to appreciate the
combination of fiction with documentary. As Alessandrini’s assistant director onLuciano
Serra, pilota (1938), Rossellini supervised the African footage that comprised almost half
the film. Later on, in his directorial debutsLa nave bianca (1941) andUn pilota ritorna
(1942), shot on assignment for the Ministries of the Navy and the Air Force, Rossellini
had incorporated actual military documentary footage, a technique that would later make
up one of the distinguishing features ofPaisa`.
17
Nor was Rossellini the only filmmaker whose artistic roots were uncomfortably
compromised by Fascism. Indeed, there were few film directors at work in the postwar
era who had not been educated and trained under the Fascist cinematic “corporation.”

Zampa, and Mario Soldati, to name only the most well-known. The “new” faces of the
neorealist school were in fact far fewer, including future icons of Italian cinema like
Michelangelo Antonioni, Luigi Comencini, Pietro Germi, Carlo Lizzani, Giuseppe De
Santis, Luciano Emmer, Federico Fellini, and Dino Risi.
18
Paradoxically, it was the degree to which postwar cinema was felt to be
compromised by its roots in the artistic heritage of Fascism that in part explains its
interpretation, at least at home, as a complete rupture. As Bondanella has observed,
“Critics, film historians, politicians, and even veterans of the film industry who had
learned their trades during the fascist period had every interest in emphasizing the
originality and revolutionary quality of what succeeded the fascist cinema – Italian
neorealism – and to denigrate everything that came before.”
19
 Hence the scarce attention
paid, until very recently and even by film historians and scholars, to the cinema of the
Fascist era, and the frequent dismissal of it as propaganda “tout court.” Consequently,
more accurate assessments of the film production under Fascism emerged relatively late,
a factor that did not help scholarship to grasp all the complexities of the cinema that was
to follow it either. In any event, such assessments revealed that in reality fascist cinema
had been much more concerned with emulating Hollywood’s commercial successes and
escapist forms of entertainment than with producing political mobilization.
At the opposite end of the debate, however, an extreme revisionism contended
that only a handful of films had been “really” fascist. However, this argument proves
equally unsatisfactory for numerous reasons. To begin with, it underplays the ideological
power of films in general, even those seemingly most innocuous. In the second instance,
it finds agreement with all those who, like Benedetto Croce, were anxious after the war to
depict Fascism as an anomaly, a fluke accident that need not motivate a search for social-
structural causes, and consequently the transformation of these. And finally, the “few
rotten apples” theory does not explain why the great majority of filmmakers would have
been so anxious to disavow fascist cinema so utterly after the war. As Brunetta has
argued,
During  the  entire  postwar  period,  efforts  were  made,  from  the  historical
point of view, to regard the phenomenon of fascist cinema as marginal and
episodic  and  to  identify  as  genuinely  fascist  only  films  dealing  directly
with fascism or the fascists. The part of the film industry that collaborated
with  fascism,  accepted  all  its  directives,  or  attempted  to  conform  to  the
climate  created  by  the  regime  was  not  taken  into  consideration.  The
prevailing  contention  that  only  about  a  dozen  propagandistic  films  were
made  is  only  partly  true.  The  truth  is  that  the  film  industry  did  not  miss
any of the regime’s identification with great moments of history, that it
followed and registered all the ideological changes at the top as well as the
basic choices of the regime’s cultural policy, thus reflecting, even in films
that  were  seemingly  not  directly  propagandistic,  the  fundamental  fascist
directives.

As the divergence between these positions suggests, neorealism embodied all the
contradictions of the time period it spanned, expressing both a certain continuity with the
past but also a rupture that was in some respects as radical as it was influential. Ironically,
one often-overlooked source of rupture was the war itself. The devastating effects of the
war altered not only the material conditions of life and of filmmaking but also the
psychology of individuals and their capacity to see “reality.” For Gilles Deleuze, for
instance, Italian cinematic neorealism was chiefly an effect of this rupture with former
ways of representing and experiencing reality. With neorealism, Deleuze identified a
passage from the “movement-image” of classical, prewar cinema, to what he calls the
“time-image.” Deleuze argued that the sensory-motor schema of traditional cinema had
been transformed by the experience of warfare, giving way to the extension and
predominance of time over action as developer of the image or shot. The function of the
image was no longer to create action but to make the relationships of time decipherable.
The characters of neorealism therefore are transformed from “actors” to “seers” who
witness and record rather than react. The crisis of the movement-image (which may be
interpreted loosely as equating the crisis of modernity or of the nation-state) began with
Hitchcock’s introduction of the “mental image” that represents webs of relations through
camera work rather than through narration. In order for this mental image to be realized,
however, it must be made by the viewer, who, no longer seen as a passive absorber of
ready-made significations, is a thinking subject who reacts and “knows” these relations,
thereby completing the making of a film. According to Deleuze, in films likeRear
Window,Spellbound, andVertigo, Hitchcock accomplished this transformation by
subjecting his characters to various injuries, traumas or phobias that cause a rupture in
their sensory-motor links and force them to react within the rules of the mental image.
This had the effect of reducing the heroes of cinema to a pure optical situation, like the
spectators of the film.
21
Following the devastating effects of the Second World War, Italian cinematic
neorealism brings this crisis to completion, amplifying it to social and epochal
dimensions. The hero of classical cinema is definitively reduced to “a kind of viewer. He
shifts, runs and becomes animated in vain, the situation he is in outstrips his motor
capacities on all sides, and makes him see and hear what is no longer subject to the rules
of a response or an action... He is prey to a vision, pursued by it or pursuing it, rather
than engaged in an action.”
22
 Indeed, Deleuze’s description effectively calls to mind the
frantic meanderings of Antonio Ricci in De Sica’s neorealist masterpiece,Ladri di
biciclette (1948). For Deleuze, then, neorealism is more than a representational break
with the past. Its rupture is pheno meno logical.
 French film critic André Bazin also interpreted neorealism more in terms of
rupture than of continuity. For Bazin, however, the central characteristic making
neorealism unlike anything that had preceded it was fundamentally moral. Unlike in
France, where the cinematic insistence on recounting the Resistance had turned this topic
into a legend, in Italy the focus of neorealism was less on the past than on the new, on the
moral, economic and social consequences ushered in by the Liberation. According to this
interpretation, Italian neorealism was less interested in creating a historical subject than

in expressing the creation of a new one. Another distinguishing feature of the Italian
liberation was that the Allied occupation had meant the installation of a new political
order rather than a return to the pre-war situation, as in France. Hence Italian cinema’s
greater interest in the quotidian, almost pedestrian, day-to-day events that witnessed this
transformation taking place, the “truth content” of a new form of existence. “The war,”
Bazin observed, “is felt to be not an interlude but the end of an era. In one sense Italy is
only three years old.”
23
 Thus for Bazin, too, neorealism represented a complete rupture
with the past, both at the level of content and of form, amounting to no less than a
“renaissance [...] spontaneously generated” of the new Italian subject.
Neorealism and the Redemptive Mission
The contradictoriness of neorealism thus lies in its use of techniques learned
under Fascism to create a new moral subject. While, as we shall see, this was not always
the case, it can be argued that, at least with respect to early neorealism, the justification
for the “neo” prefix sprang from the movement’s moral charge: while the continuity
registers on the level of aesthetics, the novelty erupts on the political and moral plane. If
certain formal elements of neorealism were traceable to the films of the 1930s, its content
was not. The novelty of neorealism was on the object of its gaze, its concern with
common people, the marginalized, the poor, and with their real-life situations that were
neither heroic, nor aristocratic, nor “beautiful.” Most importantly, however, the neorealist
gaze tended to be critical of those circumstances rather than clinically neutral.
Millicent Marcus, for instance, has argued that the consensus among neorealist
directors and the movement’s differentiation from prewar cinema was more ethical than
aesthetic. Marcus in fact cites a “shared moral commitment” which “united filmmakers
‘from above,’ dissolving their petty stylistic differences into basic agreement on the
larger issues of human concerns and general world view.”
24
Among the filmmakers and producers of neorealism there was in fact wide
consensus on the movement’s moral commitment. Rossellini himself always felt much
more comfortable discussing the moral rather than the aesthetic unity of neorealism, and
in a 1953 interview toldCahiers du Cinéma, “what do we really mean by such a word
[neorealism...] For me, it is primarily a moral stance from which to observe the world.”
25
;
and again, with respect to filmingRoma citta` aperta, he declared, “We were maintaining
a moral position more than a style.”
26
 Similarly, Vittorio De Sica, recalling his first
postwar film,Shoeshine, identified a similar redemptive task:
The experience of the war was decisive for us all. Each felt
the mad desire to throw away all the old stories of the
Italian cinema, to plant the camera in the midst of real life,
in  the  midst  of  all  that  struck  our  astonished  eyes.  We
sought to liberate ourselves from the weight of our sins, we
wanted  to  look  ourselves  in  the  face  and  tell  ourselves  the
truth,   to   discover   what   we   really   were,   and   to   seek

salvation....Shoeshine was a small stone, a very small
stone, [but it] contributed to the moral reconstruction of our
country.”
27
But perhaps the goal of neorealism was best summed up before the war had come to an
end by Umberto Barbaro, the future director of the Centro Sperimentale di
Cinematografia that was to become the cradle of cinematic neorealism: “If we in Italy
wish to abandon once and for all our trashy histories [...] we must try the cinema of
realism.”
28
Thus more than an interest in “things” for their own sake, the neorealist method
was a “moral weapon”
29
 to be used against the past in order to secure absolution for the
nation’s sins. Neorealism thus became both an “instrument leading to knowledge about
reality,”
30
 an epistemological apparatus that enabled filmmakers and audiences to see an
Italy that had been concealed during the Fascistventennio, and an ontogenetic device
allowing for the making of a new Italian. As Millicent Marcus has argued, “The rebirth of
the Italian national identity will thus owe as much to the cinema as it does to the various
political and cultural movements we normally associate with the rise of a new social
order.”
31
Neorealism’s redemptive mission helps to explain why it became the privileged
medium for representing the figure of the emigrant, which at this time registers an
important shift. In 19
th
 and 20
th
 Century literature, up to and including the Fascist-era
32
,
emigrants had been objects in need of redemption. Even when justified by economic
circumstances, their departure was usually interpreted as a form of abandonment and
betrayal, and represented a “blood letting” of the country’s resources, an illness that
threatened the well-being of the nation. During the Fascistventennio, the ban on
emigration did not prevent emigration from becoming a recurring theme in the regime’s
film production.  FromCamicia nera (1933) toPassaporto rosso (1935) andIl grande
appello (1936)
33
, the spin on emigration found agreement with the regime’s fondness for
“bonifiche,” or reclamation-rehabilitation projects. In all these films, the prevailing
message was that the emigrants could be “redeemed” if they returned to put their labor
and resources at the service of their mother country, or to answer the call of duty in times
of war. Above all else, however, emigrants could be forgiven and reclaimed as parts of
their nation if they sacrificed themselves for theirpatria. After the war, and more
specifically with the advent of neorealist cinema, the emigrant ceases to be an object of
redemption and becomes an agent of salvation, carrying forth the nation’s absolution by

mediating with the Fascist past. Paradoxically, where thefactual solution provided by
mass emigration entailed a dispersal of people and forces seen as a threat to national
security, thefigurative (ab)solution provided by emigration served to draw divergent and
scattered identities together into a cohesive national whole.
Indeed, among the chief functions of neorealism, Gian Piero Brunetta has
significantly identified that ofriappaesamento – a term that tellingly encompasses both
“re-acquaintance” and “re-nationalization.” According to this function, “ci si fa interpreti
della nascita diun italiano nuovo, prodotto di molte contraddizioni, senza verita` o
certezze, che guarda al futuro in modo tutt’altro che sicuro, e che per il momento ha
saputoriscattarsi dalla sua adesione al fascismo attraverso la sofferenza della guerra.”
34
Through the emigrants’ mediating role in this process of national “re-acquaintance,”
Fascism is at once acknowledged and displaced, and a true confrontation with the Fascist
past is deferred in favor of a politics of national reconciliation. “Le immagini del cinema
del dopoguerra, parlo di quelle di registrazione a caldo, pur nella loro carica di denuncia,
scelgono la strada non della rappresentazione mostruosa, teratologica, della guerra, del
fascismo, del nazismo, quanto una rappresentazione in cui ilsacrificio possa essere
interpretato con un ruolocatartico.”
35
With the exception of Rossellini’sOpen City andPaisa`, which belong to the
loosely labeled “war trilogy,” other neorealist classics steered wide of depictions of the
war, the Resistance, and the Fascists.
36
 It was the “ordinary” Italians, the surviving
casualties of the war who filled the screen: the orphans (Sciuscia`,Paisà), the
unemployed (Ladri di biciclette,Miracolo a Milano), and the emigrants (Fuga in
Francia,Emigrantes,Il cammino della speranza), embodying the self-sacrifice that
allowed Italy to move forward without looking back too carefully. As Brunetta observes,
“il cinema neorealista consente all’Italia, piú di qualsiasi azione diplomatica e politica, di
riprendere, non da paese vinto e subalterno, un dialogo con il resto del mondo,
presentandosi con tutte le carte in regola a favore del riscatto del suo popolo.”
37
The characters populating neorealist films tended to represent the “stock” figures
of Italian nationhood. There is the priest for Catholicism and Christian values, the mother
and father for the family and unity, the children for hope and the future, and the elderly
and authoritative figures for the past. Within this milieu, emigrants represent the
changing face of Italy, one that is free of the roots that bind to a place or to human
relations; but most of all, emigrants represent a fresh start for a nation that is turning its
back on history to recapture a lost productivity and a cleansed dream of prosperity.
Because their rootless, stateless condition is implicitly one of a lack of national identity,
they mediate the ambivalent relationship with the nation for millions of Italians whose
sense of self, following the crisis in national identity, has similarly been compromised.
The emigrants with no home stand in for the Italians with no national identity, and whose
sense of Italianness is visually reinforced through the gestures of moral catharsis enacted
on the screen. The emigrant’s journey thus becomes  the “riappaesamento” of the
audience within a cohesive nation.

Mario Soldati’sFuga in Francia (1948)
Known for his novels as much as for his films, Mario Soldati (1906-1999) had
been a central figure of the Italian cultural scene since the 1930s. He achieved national
prominence in 1935 with the publication of what would remain the most widely-read of
his literary works,America primo amore, a youthful account of his “failed emigration” to
the United States during the Great Depression. More personal anecdote than social
commentary on the emigration phenomenon,America primo amore compared the
experience of emigration to a “first love” because of the illusion it produced of being able
to escape outside oneself and give oneself completely to another. Soldati’s strong
aversion to Fascism had driven him to the United States, where he had attempted to turn
an initial fellowship at Columbia University into a permanent emigration. But
overwhelmed by nostalgia and unable to procure dignified work once his fellowship ran
out, Soldati decided to return to Fascist Italy and make amends. The result wasAmerica
primo amore, in which both the United States and emigration are portrayed in conflicting
hues. Emigration appears both as a liberating escape from the strictures of tradition and
as a form of sickness:
“[D]urante il mio primo soggiorno americano, credevo che
fosse possibile evadere: cambiare di patria, di religione, di
ricordi e di rimorsi. E vissi più di un anno nella morbosa
persuasio ne  di  esserci  riuscito.  Il  primo  amore  e  il  primo
viaggio sono malattie che si somigliano.”
38
But the most important aspect ofAmerica primo amore, one which contributed to its
instant success, was its significant contribution to the anti-modern discourse pervasive in
the Fascist culture of the 1930s. Within this discourse, the United States served as a target
upon which to dislocate Italian fears about the destabilizing power of modernity.
Soldati’s observations of life in New York strike all the nerves of this anxiety, from the
advent of female emancipation to shifting racial boundaries, the power of mass culture
(especially cinema), and the pervasiveness of consumerism.
39
Having returned to Italy in financial straits and in need of a job, Soldati took up
scriptwriting to make ends meet more than out of any personal commitment to cinematic
art. A friend of Carlo Levi’s
40
 since childhood, Soldati had strong ties to the  world of the
Turinese bourgeoisie, and did not have great difficulties landing a cinematic career under
the regime, entering the newborn state organization of the Direzione Generale per la
Cinematografia. Among his first screenplays wereLa tavola dei poveri (1932) andLa
contessa di Parma (1937), both directed by Alessandro Blasetti, whose Fascist
propaganda filmVecchia guardia (1934) was to become one of Hitler’s favorite films,
41
andGli uomini, che mascalzoni! (1932) andIl signor Max (1937), directed by Mario

 Levi painted the front cover for the first edition ofAmerica primo amore for his friend Soldati.
When the police came to Levi’s house to arrest him for antifascist activities, Levi was in the company of
Soldati, and asked the guards to kindly wait while he put the finishing touches on the painting. See Carlo
Levi’s account of this episode, “La copertina dell’America,” placed as an Appendix to the 2003 Sellerio
edition of Soldati’sAmerica primo amore.

47
Camerini. Blasetti and Camerini were both major filmmakers of the 1930s, and their
films, especially those just cited, were among the greatest successes of the Fascist film
industry. Soldati was particularly influenced by Camerini, for whose colonial filmIl
grande appello (1936), set during the Ethiopian War and shot on location in Africa,
Soldati wrote the script. “[T]ellingly, [the film] recounts the transformation of a cynical
Italian emigrant into a duty-bound patriot who sacrifices his life in the Ethiopian War.”
42
Camerini was also one of the chief exponents of “calligraphism,” a label coined
by Giuseppe De Santis to describe the cinematic style of “beautiful writing,” where
formalist preoccupations and the focus on subjects of the literary past resulted in films
with “beautiful” costuming, décor, and photography. Despite Soldati’s collaboration on
Fascist propaganda films, his own cinematic works, both before and after the war, were
quintessentially “calligraphist.” Aside from the luxurious “white telephone” films,
43
 –
romantic comedies and sentimental dramas with strong emotional impact but scarce
resemblance to everyday life – he became known mostly for bringing to the screen the
literary works of the nineteenth century bourgeoisie, such as Antonio Fogazzaro’s
Piccolo mondo antico (1941) andMalombra (1942), establishing himself as one of the
chief exponents of that “calligraphism” so lambasted by theCinema group calling for
greater realism. His films became known for their smooth, almost glossy visual texture
and refined elegance, but narratively he remained tied to conventional devices, such as
the “written letters that fill the screen, windows that close on one season and open on
another, trees and the sky that change their appearance in order to mark the passing of
time,” so criticized by De Santis in one of hisCinema articles.
44
 All this marks his
uncharacteristic turn to neorealism in the postwar era withFuga in Francia all the more
striking, especially given not only the sudden but also temporary nature of this
conversion. After this brief stint with neorealism, Soldati returned until the end of his
film career to the elegant compositions that had been his hallmark.
ButFuga in Francia was more than an aesthetic conversion, however temporary:
it fulfilled a function of “purification” for Soldati himself for his association with
Fascism, a need the director had felt quite urgently since the end of the war. After the
proclamation of the Armistice in 1943, Soldati fled from Rome to liberated Naples, now
occupied by the Allies. Until the end of the war, he shared an apartment with Riccardo
Freda, Stefano Vanzina (Steno), Dino De Laurentiis, and Leo Longanesi. All of them
were friends and more or less directly tied to the Roman world of cinema, but Longanesi
– the same who had called for greater realism in cinema in the 1930s – was also a fervent
Fascist. In an interview conducted some years later, Soldati recalled his strong need to
“purify” his friend: “Longanesi era fascista, ma lo stesso io gli ero amico. Una delle mie
ambiguità. D’altronde io cercavo di comprendere ... di capire ... Longanesi [...] era
rimasto in odore di peccato, per lui ci voleva l’assoluzione, e perché lui ottenesse questo
lo portai a casa di Benedetto Croce. Sai, Croce era per gli intellettuali il numero uno

dell’antifascismo, era lui che poteva dare l’assoluzione, e io che gli avevo portato
Longanesi da fascista glielo riportai una seconda volta ‘convertito’.”
45
In July of 1944, Soldati became the Secretary of the Socialist Cinema Union. A
few days later, a “purge committee” was established that brought together Umberto
Barbaro, Mario Chiari, Luchino Visconti, Mario Camerini, and Mario Soldati. The
committee composed a list of all the filmmakers who had collaborated with the regime,
but in the end only three directors, Goffredo Alessandrini, Carmine Gallone, and Augusto
Genina, were punished – with a six month suspension from work. “Soon after that, the
decision of the commission was revoked, and the film purges were over and closed.”
46
Collective collaboration with the dictatorship had been very widespread in the film
industry, where a system of combined censorship and patronage had rendered
collaboration with the government difficult to avoid. So it was that “[e]ven those who had
chosen to work for Salo` did not see studio privileges suspended. The documentary film-
maker Francesco De Robertis, who had been a major figure in Salo` cinema, continued to
make military films in the post-war period.”
47
The half-hearted purge of the film industry – the regime’s “strongest weapon” –
in effect reflected a wider reluctance in postwar Italy to rid the nation’s political,
economic, and cultural spheres of fascist elements. Thus, Mario Soldati’s claim, with
reference to his role in the purge committee, “Non abbiamo voluto fare niente, perché
tutti avevamo partecipato, più o meno,”
48
 summarized the attitude of most filmmakers –
and Italians – after the dictatorship. Yet the making ofFuga in Francia a few years later
demonstrates a nagging concern or embarrassment for Soldati over his collaboration with
Fascism. Just asAmerica primo amore had served to “rehabilitate” him within the
regime,
49
Fuga in Francia was an attempt to purge himself – and the Italian people – of
the stain of Fascism. Moreover, given the moral charge of neorealism, it is not surprising
that Soldati should have turned to this style, otherwise so alien to him, for a project of
nat ional redempt ion.
WhenFuga in Francia was released in 1948, Italy was still in the midst of post-
war reconstruction, and aimed at projecting an image of social and economic recovery at
odds with the poverty and backwardness suggested by the film’s focus on emigration.
Partly inspired by a true story, the film narrates the attempt of an ex-Fascist hierarch,
Riccardo Torre, to escape to France so as to avoid prosecution in Italy. Accompanied by
his young son, Fabrizio, he travels in disguise, concealing his true identity to everyone
they encounter. Along the way they join a group of three emigrants – Tembien (played by
Pietro Germi), a resistance fighter who has lost his little boy during the war, his brother
Gino, and the ambiguousil tunisino, all of them similarly attempting to cross the French
border illegally in search of work. On the eve of their border-crossing, they all spend the
night in a local tavern, where Gino has a romantic tryst with Pierina, the barmaid.
Tension develops when Pierina recognizes Torre as her old employer. Desperate to

preserve his anonymity, Torre murders her before she is able to report him to the police.
But the emigrants discover Torre’s true identity before reaching the border. Resisting the
temptation to simply execute him, they decide to hand Torre over to the authorities, even
though this means jeopardizing their own plans of clandestine emigration. Torre manages
to elude them and enters France, where in a shoot-out with the emigrants he injures his
son, Fabrizio. Carelessly abandoning Fabrizio, Torre escapes yet again, but he is caught
thanks to the joint efforts of the Italian and French police forces. Because of their heroic
gestures, the emigrants are allowed to stay in France, where Tembien, moved by fatherly
affection, presumably adopts Fabrizio.
Emigration itself is of course not the real subject ofFuga in Francia but provides
an expedient for articulating two other inter-related themes. The first is that of the
complicity of Italy’s older generations with Fascism; the second is what relationship the
younger generations – those not responsible for having supported the dictatorship –
should develop with the Fascist past of their nation. On both these issues, the film largely
embodies Italy’s own ambivalence, somewhat mirroring the hasty and inconclusive
achievements of the purge committee on which Soldati had sat.
The first theme is developed with great skill in the film’s opening scenes, where
Soldati depicts the collusion and hypocrisy of the ecclesiastical authorities, as they
continue to provide a network of support for the ex-hierarchs of the regime. Soldati
renders the intimacy between religious and political institutions masterfully when he has
the rector of a religious college, a high priest, receive the fleeing Torre, who has come to
him for help disguised as a cleric. The priest never acknowledges their old friendship, not
even when Torre calls him by his first name, Giacomo, and asks, somewhat bewildered,
“Ma come, non mi riconosci?” Though Torre and Giacomo grew up together and were
close friends in the same school, the priest insists throughout their exchange on
countering Torre’s familiar use of  “tu” with the formal and distant “Lei.” Nonetheless,
he admits Torre into his bedroom and efficiently provides him with money and a more
inconspicuous disguise.
This first section of the film is driven by Soldati’s desire to “unveil” the Church’s
two-faced support of Fascism. The Church continues to collaborate with Fascism while
also hypocritically denying its collusion in the past. As Torre changes into his new
clothes in the priest’s bedroom, he reminisces aloud about their past together: “Quanti
anni sono passati. 1912, 1913, ti ricordi? Quando suonava, io e te ci rifugiavamo in
palestra. Allora, a nessuno dei due piaceva il collegio, e avevamo sempre il pensiero di
scappare. Ti ricordi, Giacomo, i nostri progetti di fuga?” The priest replies icily, “No.
Non ricordo,” before turning his back to Torre. The very same religious authorities that
should be denouncing the dictatorship and its war crimes demonstrate instead an iron will
to deny their own complicity. Torre and the priest are thus represented as equals in a
variety of ways: through their common past; through their friendship and connections;
through their exchange of clothing (Torre initially appears disguised as a priest, then the
priest gives him civilian clothes that fit, “forse ho un abito che le andra` bene”); but also
through the similar low-angle close-ups of their faces during their first exchange, which
imply that the Fascist and the priest both share the same power relationship with respect
to the audience and, by extension, the Italian population.
Torre and Giacomo stand for the leading authorities of the Italian nation during
the ventennio and, apparently, beyond. This point is very effectively reinforced by

50
flanking the Fascist hierarch with the religious “father.” Hence, Fabrizio’s perplexed
question, “Papà, ma sei qui?” when he discovers his father sneaking into the school
dressed in a priest’s frock, is an admonition to the new generations about the tenacious
web of power relations constructed by the Fascist regime.
The new generation’s confrontation with the nation’s troubled past is represented
through the contrast between Fabrizio’s relationship with his father on the one hand and
that which develops between him and the emigrant Tembien on the other. Largely
ignored when not exploited by his uncaring father, Fabrizio begins to grow fond of
Tembien. Indeed, Tembien is a sympathetic character in every way that Torre is not. An
ex-resistance fighter who liberated Italy from Nazi-Fascism, he is a simple, honest, and
morally upright worker who has been forced into his clandestine condition by
unemployment: “In fondo, noi vogliamo soltanto lavorare. E` colpa nostra se in questo
paese non se ne trova piu`?”  Though poor, he is unfailingly generous and benevolent
towards his fellow human beings. But most of all, Tembien is a fatherly figure who takes
a genuine interest in Fabrizio’s well-being. Teaching by example, he demonstrates that
high principles should always trump personal gain. Torre, on the other hand, bears all the
qualities that stand for the corrupt Fascist past: he is selfish, greedy, and dishonest. He
has no qualms about abandoning his son when he is no longer a convenient accessory of
his escape, and he stops at nothing, not even murder, to obtain his immoral goals. As a
man, a father, and a citizen he is a disgrace, and he represents that part of the corrupt past
that the new generations should repudiate. In fact, once he has realized the true nature of
his father, Fabrizio does precisely that, claiming to the French authorities, “I do not know
him.”
Yet there is a sense in which the confrontation depicted by Soldati, based on such
extreme stereotypes as Torre and Tembien, is also a form of forgetting. Torre, the next
thing to a psychopath, is anything but the common Italian, and in the gap between him
and the Resistance fighter Tembien there is an enormous void that neorealist films never
filled with the common Italians who had given their consent – however actively or
passively – to Fascism. For instance, in Rossellini’s third “war trilogy” film,Germania
anno zero, also of 1948, a young boy kills his sick “burdensome” father upon the indirect
suggestion of another figure of authority, his former school teacher. InFuga in Francia,
the responsibility for Fascist collusion is similarly attached to figures of authority, not
only narratively but also formally: Torre is filmed so as to hover over the other characters
in the film; his portly presence fills the screen with its suggestion of the encumbering
weight of Fascism, while low-angle close-ups of his face are intercut with high-angle
shots of the hapless Pierina in tense anticipation of their confrontation and its fatal
outcome. Thus the neorealist project to create new, morally-cleansed Italians was
achieved by creating subjects who werea priori innocent, and, like the violently
murdered Pierina, victims of “a few bad apples.”
Redrawing Italy’s moral map according to a binary logic of victim-executioner
entailed a new iconography of border-crossing that emerged after the war. Contrary to
traditional emigration literature, in which the ship’s crossing of the Equator invariably
introduced forms of sickness, madness or even death among the emigrants, border-
crossing in postwar emigration narratives represents an act of transformation and rebirth.
Since the emigrants, in their new capacity as agents of national absolution, must no
longer redeem themselves but the nation, their movement across national boundaries

51
represents a form of collective “healing,” a “cleansing” of the nation’s corrupt past, as
symbolized by the “recovery” of the injured Fabrizio after he has repudiated his father on
the other side of the nation’s border.
Aldo Fabrizi’sEmigrantes (1949)
So powerful is the postwar iconography of redemptive border-crossing within the
nation’s new moral map, that it superimposes itself even upon narratives still employing
the ocean voyage model of emigration, such as the 1949 filmEmigrantes, directed and
starred by Aldo Fabrizi. In 1945, Fabrizi had starred in Rossellini’sRoma citta` apertaas
don Pietro Pellegrini, a character inspired by the figures of don Pietro Pappagallo and don
Giuseppe Morosini, who were executed at the Fosse Ardeatine and at Forte Bravetta,
respectively, by the German army occupying Rome. After this memorable performance,
Fabrizi became not only one of the most prolific actors of Italian postwar cinema but
also, along with Anna Magnani, one of the figures most closely associated with neorealist
cinema. Moreover, his role as a holy victim of Nazi persecution helped pave the way for
the figurative exoneration of ordinary Italians – and, with the exception ofFuga in
Francia, of the Catholic Church – from the sin of Fascism. Four years later, Fabrizi made
his directorial debut withEmigrantes, which appealed to a more popular audience and
was commercially more successful thanFuga in Francia, at home and abroad. In
Argentina, where the film was partly set, both Evita Peron and Italian film star Amedeo
Nazzari attended the film’s opening.
50
Emigrantes narrates the plight of a Roman family who, having lost a son and its
livelihood as a result of the war, decides to emigrate to Argentina. While Giuseppe
Borbone (Aldo Fabrizi) and his daughter Maria are eager to begin a new life abroad, his
wife, Adele (Ave Ninchi), curbs their enthusiasm with her mounting nostalgia, to the
point of opposing her daughter’s engagement to a wealthy Argentine businessman and
demanding that they return to their beloved Rome. Eventually, however, Adele is won
over by the generosity and solidarity of the Italian community in Buenos Aires, especially
among the other emigrants they had befriended on the ocean crossing, and ultimately
agrees to stay in Argentina. LikeFuga in Francia, Fascist hierarchs on the run and the
collusion of the Catholic Church also make their appearance inEmigrantes, albeit
without a critique or direct reference made to either, past or present. Rather, the film
serves as an illustration of the politics of pacification forced upon neorealism on the heels
of the 1948 electoral victory of the Christian Democrats and Italy’s 1949 entry into the
NATO alliance.
The effects of this new geopolitical configuration on the Italian film industry were
immediate. Under the direction of key Christian Democrat and vice-Prime Minister
Giulio Andreotti, the government’s cultural agenda featured a system of censorship and
control of the film industry that was perhaps even tighter than it had been under the
Fascist regime. In many respects, the DC-led government, particularly during the 1950s,
was even more repressive than the dictatorship had been in limiting the kinds of cultural
products that could reach mass audiences, quickly abandoning anti-Fascism in favor of
anti-Communism soon after the election. Film projects on the Fascist assassination of
Giacomo Matteotti, for instance, or on the wartime massacre of nearly 13,000 Italian

soldiers by German forces in Cephalonia never saw the light of day. In 1953, scriptwriter
Renzo Renzi and editor Guido Aristarco were arrested, then tried and convicted by a
military tribunal for having published the script ofArmata s’agapò, a film project on the
Italian wartime occupation of Greece, on theCinema Nuovo film magazine of which
Aristarco was editor.
 51
The combination of political and economic pressures with downright intimidation,
exercised through the triad of the Christian Democratic Party, the Catholic Church, and
Hollywood, was extremely successful in steering the direction of Italian film production
and distribution during this time. It was not long before directors learned what kinds of
films were likely to allow them to continue to work, “adapting” themselves or their work
to the new directives much as they had under the regime. A cultural politics involving
censorship, denial of funds, and various other forms of obstructionism thus had
devastating effects upon neorealism’s critical capacity, transforming it into the “rosy”
variety so prevalent in the 1950s. The already mentioned reluctance to deal with the
Fascist past met with institutional and industrial pressures that sought to exclude from
view what had been strongest in neorealist cinema, namely the focus on the war and its
aftermath and on social problems such as economic inequality and the emigration it set
off. The claim of one member of the clergy that “[i]l popolo vuole dimenticare Cefalonia,
Salerno, le Fosse Ardeatine e tutte le tremende cose che non devono essere
cinematografate”
52
 is representative of a whole strategy of systematic forgetting applied
from 1948 onward.
Andreotti’s famous open letter to De Sica, first published on the DC-friendly
newspaperLibertas in February of 1952 on the occasion of De Sica’s filming ofUmberto
D, is illustrative of this repressive agenda and was meant to be heeded by all neorealist
filmmakers. The letter essentially condemned the neorealist practice of putting Italy’s
social woes on display, adhering to the adage that it is always best not to air the nation’s
dirty laundry in public. Placing the matter on the plane of national pride, Andreotti
concluded that if Italy was judged abroad according to De Sica’s crude representations,
then “De Sica avra` reso un pessimo servigio alla sua patria.”
53
 Still in 1952, in an
interview by the weekly magazineOggi, Andreotti clearly spelled out the new objectives
of cinema: “Macché film realisti, facciamo film sulle virtú teologali e cardinali.”
54
The pressure applied upon all levels of cinematic production did not have as its
aim the total elimination of representations of social ills from public view, for it was
precisely these representations that had enabled millions of Italians to see in cinema a
major point of reference, ensuring that Italian cinema achieve such enormous success and
ideological power. Rather, the aim of Andreottian cultural politics was to recast these
representations through a sanitizing lens, preferring to transform rather than eliminate
them. Hence, films appearing as vaguely neorealist actually served to shed a more
benevolent light upon Italian institutions of power, which, it is always worth

remembering, had never been purged entirely of Fascist sympathies. As Brunetta
observes,
Andreotti non vuole che ci sia immersione totale in realtà di cui si
preferisce  ignorare  la  profondità.  Egli  riveste  il  ruolo  del  super-io  che
impedisce  il  tentativo  di  discesa  verso  zone  oscure  del  sociale  che  il
fascismo  non  aveva  mai  voluto  portare  alla  luce.  La  profilassi  adottata  e`
quella    dell’isolamento,    della    disinfestazione    e    della    progressiva
affermazione di realtà simili ma ripulite, purgate, piú ricche di attrattive
sessuali e povere di implicazioni ideologiche.
55
This kind of authoritarianism prompted Soldati himself to observe “Oggi, a cinque anni
dalla liberazione, e` troppo difficile realizzare film che non siano conformisti e che
attacchino, anche minimamente, la politica e la religione,” and producer Carlo Ponti to
remark sardonically that “a pochi anni di distanza sarebbe impossibile realizzareRoma
città aperta, poiché non sarebbe gradito ai tedeschi.”
56
One of the most acute critiques of this transformation of neorealism under the
DC’s authoritarian cultural po lit ics came fro m Marxist literary and film crit ic Carlo
Muscetta. In a 1954 article titled “Cinema controrealista,”
57
  Muscetta lambasted the
light-hearted treatment of social issues in this phony version of neorealism. In films such
as Luigi Zampa’sVivere in pace (also starring Aldo Fabrizi), the war came closer to
being the subject of comedy than of drama. The neorealist themes of solidarity and
human charity, emptied of their critical content, maintained only the outer shell of reality
while preserving that “bucolic” and “cordial” tone that had formed the stock of many
Fascist films.  These “Jesuitical films” turned resistance values such as solidarity into
Catholic doctrine while holding on to the formal, aesthetic motifs of neorealism. By
presenting “reality” under a consoling, idyllic veneer, they used the silver screen to
harmonize the tensions tearing at the seams of Italian society. Such films served up a
reality that was deformed, where a persisting, cumbersome and decadent bourgeoisie was
hidden from view while the proletariat made a “puppet” appearance only to confirm the
clergy’s leading role in the redemption of Italian society. Taking Luigi Comencini’s
tremendously successfulPane amore e fantasia (1953) as a case in point, Muscetta
demonstrated how the very terms of social strife were inverted, mystified, until what
remained was a parody of domination:
Che  cosa  accade  nel  famoso  paesino  dove  c’è  poco  pane,  molto  amore  e
moltissima     ‘fantasia’?     I     termini     della     realta`     sono     capovolti
scherzosamente  [...]  Se  vedete  case  distrutte  voi  pensate  che  si  tratti  di
bombardamento.  No,  terremoto.  E  quando  credete  sia  terremoto,  no,  si
tratta  di  bombardamento.  Ciò  è  comico  nella  forma  più  elementare  e
superficiale del comico, ma intanto serve benissimo a porre la guerra tra le
calamità  che  il  buon  Dio  ci  riserva  normalmente,  e  dinanzi  a  cui  non  c’è
nulla  da  fare.  Si  muore  a  poco  a  poco?  E  che  importa?  L’importante  è
riderci  su.  Siamo  in  un  centro  rurale,  ma  nessuna  di  quelle  questioni
agrarie che in forme varie affliggono oggi la vita italiana affligge l’allegro

paesello.  La  terra  è  già  tutta  dei  contadini  e  questo  spiega  (come  dice  il
saggio  parroco)  la  miseria  generale.  Se  c’è  miseria,  ci  saranno  allora  dei

procace  insegna  la  modestia  ai  carabinieri  e  compromette  l’avvenire  della

può  accontentarsi  di  mangiare  solo  pane  e  accompagnarlo  con  tutto  ciò
che egli si può liberamente inventare.”
58
Muscetta’s critique introduces the Gramscian concept of “transformism.” What
was being transformed in these years was not just neorealist cinema but its socio-political
referent. Neorealism’s swift transformation from an instrument of social critique to one
of social harmonization was a cultural weapon for mollifying political and intellectual
dissidence and working class resentment. In Gramscian terms, “transformism” refers to
the political absorption of the opposition into the dominant group until no real alternative
remains to challenge the dominant group’s hegemony. In the case of neorealism, we can
see how its cooptation into a “rosy” version served an ideological function in the famed
political transformism of the DC after the war, which managed to pull in the Left while
holding fast onto the Right. As Muscetta concludes, “Pane, amore e fantasia fu messo in
circolazione durante l’età [...] saturnina della distensione verbale e formale, dell’apertura
a destra con le gentilezze a sinistra. Nacque così questo mitico, pacifico, divertente
strapaesello.”
59
 As Muscetta’s clever use of the term “strapaesello” suggests, the
transformation of neorealism is but one way in which the DC era formed a continuation
of Fascism.
The pressures to transform neorealism from instrument of critique to mechanism
for pacification can be observed in the filmEmigrantes. Though emigration to South
America in the late 1940s had become, as we shall see, a matter of heated controversy
both in Italy and abroad,Emigrantes testifies to the preference among the nation’s
cultural and political leadership to allow certain versions of the issue to be filmed rather
than none at all. Thus, while the film borrows some of its formal elements from
neorealism, such as on location shooting, the use of Roman dialect, the concern with
common subjects, and attention to a thorny social issue such as emigration, it nonetheless
aims more to console public opinion about emigration than to inflame it. Poverty is
depicted as part of the folklore, divested of all its squalor and indignity. Similarly,
emigration is reduced to an episode in the lives of an impoverished but good-natured
populace who confronts its miseries and the decision to emigrate with the same good
humor required for a picnic in the countryside.
The motivations for depicting emigration, particularly to South America, in such a
conciliatory light were undeniably political. In Italy as in Argentina and Brazil, the
emigration of thousands of ex-hierarchs of the regime and of convicted war criminals was
provoking episodes of dissent and violence. AsFuga in Francia had implied, the Vatican
played no small role in providing such individuals with support in the form of money,
fake passports, and even sanctuary within its seminaries and convents in South America.
To cite only a few of the most notorious examples, this was the case with Tullio

Tamburini, chief of police in the Republic of Salò, also known as “il grande bastonatore”;
or with thesquadrista and last acting secretary of the Fascist National Party, Carlo
Scorza, whose close ties with “powerful friends” in the Vatican had once provoked
Mussolini’s disapproval; or with Cesare Maria De Vecchi, “governor” of Somalia and
Rhodes and ambassador to the Vatican; or with Minister Luigi Federzoni, after whose
fate the Pope himself had enquired; or with chief of political investigations for the
Republic of Salò, Gaio Gradenigo, also known as a “ferocious torturer.” The list of
Fascist hierarchs and war criminals who were allowed to flee to South America thanks to
the 1946 amnesty, not to mention the Vatican’s secret “road of the convents,” was really
quite long, counting several thousands. Moreover, the  movement of such individuals and
their assets had far-reaching political implications, allowing for the strengthening of neo-
Fascist movements in South America that in turn supported the neo-Fascist MSI party in
Italy and continued to influence Italian politics for decades. While it is difficult to
estimate how many Fascist hierarchs and war criminals were among the hundreds of
thousands of Italians who crossed the ocean in search of work after the war, a general
idea is provided by the successful campaign conducted in Brazil for the release of
Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, “viceroy” of Ethiopia, where he was nicknamed “the
butcher.” In any event, the massive influx of such individuals inevitably created friction
within Italian communities abroad, where anti-Fascists and Jews had sought refuge
precisely from the regime and its racial laws. However, their disapproval and the repeated
objections of the Italian consular authorities in Argentina and Brazil were largely
impotent against the Italian Foreign Ministry’s indifference and the Argentine
government’s thirst for Italian ingenuity and money to industrialize and populate its
country.
60
Rather than condemning the impunity that emigration provided ex-hierarchs and
war criminals, or the role of the Church in their escape,Emigrantes attempts to instill a
conciliatory mood. The film’s timid and benevolent treatment of Fascist emigration is not
surprising, given that one of the writers of the screenplay was Piero Ballerini, a
filmmaker for the Republic of Salò. Early in the film, Fabrizi’s character, Giuseppe
Borbone, and his friend Gigi unfold a map to show Giuseppe’s wife, Adele, where
Argentina is. To judge the distance they must travel, she then asks where Italy is. A
close-up of the map frames Giuseppe’s and Gigi’s fingers tracing a path over the ocean
and then over Africa. Gigi observes, “Questa e` la Libia,” to which Fabrizi adds, “Era
grossa.” When their fingers reach Italy, they tell Adele, “Questa e` l’Italia,” to which she
exclaims, “Guarda l’Italia quant’e` piccola!” Trying to assuage his wife’s fears over the
excessive length of the voyage, Giuseppe replies, “E vabbè, è stampata male,” while Gigi
adds, “Sono le solite prepotenze internazionali. C’arrimpiccioliscono pure sulle carte
geografiche.” Though brief, this exchange is significant in framing the terms of the
responsibility for postwar emigration to a peace accord interpreted as unfair because it
stripped Italy of its colonies, including Libya. Having thus forced all the Italians to return
to an Italy made “smaller,” it is this international bullying that is chiefly responsible for
forcing the emigration of so many Italians.
The reference to Fascist emigration comes in the form of a mysterious character,
played by a young Adolfo Celi, who poses as a carpenter in front of emigration

56
authorities but whom all the other emigrants onboard the ship call “the Professor.” His
erudition, sophisticated manners and cultured Italian are only a few of the clues that tell
viewers he is not who he claims to be. The other emigrants regard him as an authority
figure (hence the vague “Professor” title), hanging on his every word, which tends to
come in the form of sermons. As the emigrants share their first meal on board, Giuseppe
Borbone, Gigi, and a Neapolitan named Gennarino reflect on the circumstances pushing
them to emigrate. If everyone had his piece of bread, Giuseppe claims, no one would
need to go in search of it so far away from home. While this could have been the cue for
an elaborate commentary on social inequality and its effects on Italian mass migration,
the Professor’s sanctimonious reply arrives in time to nip any critical reflection in the
bud: “Io credo che noi, da fuori della nostra patria, dobbiamo vedere in questo primo
pane una promessa di lavoro e di pace. La vita in fondo non ha altra poesia.”
Borrowing from traditional emigration literature, the tension begins to build as the
ship nears the Equator, coming to a climax as the emigrants cross over into the southern
hemisphere. As in traditional emigration narratives, this is a moment of deep crisis
marked by physical and mental anguish: Adele, who is pregnant, has gone into labor
prematurely. Her labor pains are matched by psychological trauma when she learns that
the baby will automatically be born an Argentine citizen since they are in international
waters aboard an Argentine ship. Construing this as another act of international bullying,
Adele complains about having her son “taken away” (i.e. not being given Italian
citizenship) simply because they are under the Argentine flag. “Ce mettessero ’na
bandiera italiana,” she explodes, “qui siamo settecento italiani e dieci argentini!”
Giuseppe’s placating response is aimed at the audience more than at his wife: “Sai,
infondo sarebbe bello averci un figlio estero. Se molti figli nascessero all’estero, si
eviterebbero pure le guerre.”  Emigration in other words emerges as an instrument to
avoid putting “i figli contro i padri,” not only in war but also in the reckoning process that
follows, when the younger generation might judge its elders’ adhesion to the dictatorship.
Emigration thus fulfills its role as a “release valve” in totality, not only for economic and
political motives but also for ethico-ideological ones. As they cross the Equator and the
Argentines hold a celebratory ball above deck, Adele goes into labor. The image of her
pained face is superimposed with that of the Argentine flag flying on the mast of the ship,
clearly rendering her anguish ideological as much as physical. The Professor efficiently
intervenes to help deliver the baby, prompting the doctor to praise him later, telling the
emigrants waiting outside – including Giuseppe – that they have the Professor to thank
for the safe delivery of the baby. “L’ho sempre saputo io che non era un operaio, con
quell’aria così distinta,” Gennarino claims. “Ho fatto molti mestieri,” the Professor
admits, “tra i quali anche l’infermiere.” But the doctor interjects, “Altro che infermiere!”
This exchange reinforces the impression that the Professor had held a position of
authority during the regime, perhaps that of a doctor. While the film echoes traditional
emigration narratives by depicting the trauma of separation from the nation (the crossing
of the Equator), it also effortlessly incorporates the new iconography of the border-
crossing by portraying this as predominantly a moment of birth, of national regeneration.
Thus emigration no longer represents a form of death or a “blood-letting” of the nation
but rather its opposite, a rebirth of the nation.
After the birth of the baby, Giuseppe and the Professor share a quiet moment
above deck, looking out onto a still horizon. The peacefulness of the scene is suggestive

57
not only of the resolution of Adele’s birthing crisis, but of the achievement of a much
broader form of pacification. With considerable delicacy, Giuseppe asks, “Mi scusi tanto,
ma lei chi è, che faceva?” The Professor’s vague reply is a dismissal of the issue for the
entire nation: “Lasciamo andare. Solo la prego di credere che non ho mai fatto male a
nessuno.”
The following scene, and the transition to it, are really the crux of the film.
Before Giuseppe and the Professor have completely faded out, the next shot fades in,
superimposing the image of a crucifix between the heads of the two men, suggesting a
reconciliation through Catholicism has occurred, inaugurating a new era of peace in a
divided nation. As the new shot fades in, the camera zooms out to encompass a priest
performing mass above deck. The background hymn clues us in that this is a solemn
occasion, which we are soon made to understand, from the Borbone family’s proximity to
the priest, that it is the newborn’s baptism. However, standing closer to the priest,
between the priest and the Borbone family, is the Professor. As with the Professor’s
“birthing” of the baby, this shot serves to reaffirm the leading role that old figures of
authority should continue to exercise in Italian society. This scene has very little to do
with the baptism of the baby, which is a private affair that would not have taken place for
another couple of months, and everything to do with the absolution of the nation for its
Fascist past and present. As the camera pans across the deck, we see that the occupants of
the entire ship are present, like a microcosm of the Italian nation. In reverent silence, they
listen to the priest’s Latin chant, and in unison make the sign of the cross when the priest
blesses them en-masse. The redemption of the nation, significantly occurring after the
crossing of the Equator, is thus led by the Church, an interpretation confirmed by the
priest’s sanctimonious reply to Borbone’s request to combine holy water they brought
from Rome with the priest’s Argentine holy water: “Tutte le patrie si riuniscono
nell’infinita grandezza di Dio.” As though to strengthen his words, the camera pans over
the still crowd once more before tracking upward to take in the top of the ship’s mast,
shaped like a giant crucifix against a serene sky, as the chorus of emigrants pronounces
its “Amen.” The baptism represents the restabilization of a national identity that had
entered into crisis, a crisis portrayed in the film in terms of a dispute over citizenship
aboard a ship. Presided over by traditional figures of authority such as the Catholic
Church and the Fascist hierarchy, this restabilization brings about a rebirth of the Italian
nation.
Conclusion
In the narratives examined here, crossing the border represents the renunciation of
the past and the inauguration of a cleansed future. The emigrant and the child, those who
“cross over” into a new moral dimension, are the figures invested with the power to
rebuild the devastated ideology of the nation. WhileFuga in Francia may not have gone
far enough in denouncing Fascism as a mass movement involving the Italian populace at
large rather than just a few leaders,Emigrantes actually represents a restoration of Right-
wing power through a cultural politics of mystification, distortion, and amnesia. But the
second film was made possible by the first. In the difference between these two films lies
the “transformation” of neorealism, registering all that had changed, and at the same time
all that had not changed enough, in Italian politics and culture in that intervening year. In
The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, Karl Marx recalls Hegel’s observation that

58
all grand historical events occur twice. He chides Hegel, however, for not having
specified that the first time they occur as tragedy, the second time as farce. Marx’s
treatise is a brilliant reflection on the power of mass culture to supply ideological support
for counter-revolutionary restoration. In the Italian postwar context, Marx’s reflection
suggests that the “rosy” variety of neorealism that parodied the wreckage bequeathed by
Fascist domination, may have been, like Torre’s figure inFuga in Francia, the wolf in
sheep’s clothing. Under the guise of peace-maker, it helped to restore a right-wing
interpretation of history and a conservative set of values perceived to be threatened by
neorealism’s disquietingly brutal gaze. But culture being more complex than dominant
social forces tend to appreciate, not all of neorealism was cannibalized by its farcical
version. Its most critical threads went underground, reemerging a decade later in the
works of a second generation of filmmakers devoted to restoring neorealism’s critical
import. But that is the subject of the next chapter.

CHAPTER 3
LA FABBRICA DI ITALIANI: ECONOMIC MIRACLE, INTERNAL
MIGRATION, AND NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION
The rhetorical crossing of spatio-temporal and moral frontiers in the immediate
postwar period had failed to provide a lasting solution to Italy’s historical crisis of
national identity by the time the nation headed into the so-called economic “miracle.”
1
Indeed, this identity crisis developed into outright trauma as the Italian national
imaginary strove to keep pace with sweeping socio-economic changes. Intensive
urbanization and industrialization literally changed the face of cities like Rome and
Milan, while increased mobility and transportation, Americanization, and the
proliferation of the culture industry reflected and at the same time facilitated the
explosion of consumer culture. As the reorganization of capital around consumption,
neocapitalism demonstrated its novelty in the intensive propagation of commodification
itself: as every aspect of social life, including culture, became a product, Italy was
transformed into a society of mass consumption.
2
Emigration once again came to play a fundamental role in defining the Italian
nation, acting as both cause and effect of the economic miracle. Moving from country to
city, from South to North, millions of Italians changed their way of life and literally
reshaped the face of the nation overnight. For many Italians, the unprecedented encounter
with populations from diverse and distant regions of the peninsula produced a profound

While I use the term “neo-capitalism” throughout this chapter to signal the novelties of capitalist
expansion in the context of postwar Italy, I identify it with the definition of “late capitalism” developed by
the economist Ernest Mandel in his postwar analysis of the new global form of capitalism. Whereas Marx
had theorized the evolution of “classical” (market) capitalism and Lenin had identified a second stage in
“monopoly” (imperialist) capitalism, Mandel saw capitalism in postwar society as having entered a third
stage, which he called “late” capitalism, to emphasize not a rupture with previous forms of capitalistic
expansion but rather an intensification and all-pervasiveness that rendered it the most “pure” form. In
Mandel’s argument, late capitalism is the stage in which capital comes to colonize previously untouched
areas, exploding into mass consumption mode. Fredric Jameson credits Mandel’s scheme as having been
very influential in his own conceptualization of postmodernism as the “cultural logic” of late capitalism.

Jameson,Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (New York: Verso, 1991), 35-6.

shock. This was due in large measure to the fact that the imaginary borders once
separating the nation from its internal Others had suddenly shifted, as a consequence of
internal migration, to within very close proximity of the urban centers of the modern
nation, triggering the need to construct new “fronts” beyond which to dislocate the
nat ion’s figures o f alterit y.
Though emigration to Europe, the Americas and Australia continued throughout
the economic miracle, the more massive phenomenon of internal migration proved
exceptionally fruitful for the figurative reproduction of the nation, generating a discursive
field that employed both spatial and temporal markers to produce an image of Italy as
finally “modern.” Engaging with influential sociological texts and key cinematic works
by Luchino Visconti and Pier Paolo Pasolini, this chapter will examine the function of
internal migration in redefining Italian national identity during this crucial period of the
nation’s history.
The Economic “Miracle”
On the eve of the economic miracle, Italy was still predominantly a nation of
peasants. With the exception of a few large cities concentrated mainly in the northwest
corner of the peninsula, Italy remained a pre-industrial nation. Yet between 1958 and
1963, Italy became one of the world’s largest industrial powers, and its socio-cultural
structure was forever altered as the country went through nothing short of an industrial
revo lution.
3
 The effect upon the Italian population was dramatic, for it was given very
little time to become accustomed to the drastic social and cultural changes that
accompanied the economic boom. This rapid process of transformation was rendered
even more striking by the massive flow of internal migration that moved much of the
countryside into the industrial cities, for the first time bringing into contact urban
residents with a rural population consistently represented as pre-modern.
Italy’s “miraculous” economic expansion can be explained in part by the
reorientation of industrial production towards international trade and the intensification of
production for mass markets (including ex-colonies), which was common to all the
European countries experiencing a postwar economic boom.

 For a general overview of Italian industrialization during the miracle, see Russell King,The
Industrial Geography of Italy(London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1988), and George Hildebrand,Growth and
Structure in the Economy of Modern Italy (London: Harvard University Press, 1965), which pays particular
attention to the fiscal policies that contributed to Italian economic growth.

 Walter Laqueur’sEurope in Our Time: A History 1945-1992 (New York: Penguin, 1993)
provides a comparative view of Italy’s “stormy” growth within the broader context of political and
economic change in both Western and Eastern Europe. Interestingly, inThe European Economy Since
1945: Coordinated Capitalism and Beyond (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007), Barry
Eichengreen explains Europe’s extraordinary economic recovery in terms of some of its historical
institutions, such as trade unions and other solidarity-based associations.

“Autarchy” refers to economic and cultural policies of self-sufficiency enacted by the Fascist
regime after the League of Nations placed economic sanctions upon Italy in 1935 for its invasion of
Ethiopia. In cultural and economic terms, autarchy signified the reduction of exchange with foreign
products and ideas, though of course this campaign was fraught with considerable contradictions. See Ruth
Ben-Ghiat,Fascist Modernities: Italy, 1922-1945 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2001),
135-8. Richard J. Bosworth discusses autharchy in the context of a drift towards a war economy in
Mussolini’s Italy (New York: Penguin, 2006), 312-313; while Barbara Spackman examines the role of
autarchy in the economy of the regime’s colonial discourse inFascist Virilities: Rhetoric, Ideology, and
Social Fantasy in Italy (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1996), 130, 172.

modes of production, Italy entered the export-driven economy by providing the European
liberal market first with foodstuffs and textiles and then with plastics, petrochemicals,
precision tools, and electric appliances. In little more than a decade, Italy went from
being one of the most industrially underdeveloped nations of Europe to becoming one of
its leading economic powers.
6
The magnitude of Italy’s industrial expansion in these years is indeed staggering.
Between 1952 and 1970, the average income of Italians increased more than 130%.
During the same time period, the increase for France and England was of 36% and 32%,
respectively.
7
 The manufacturing of appliances is symptomatic of this expansion: while
Italy produced only 18,500 refrigerators in 1951, by 1957 this number had grown to
370,000, and by 1967 it had reached 3,200,000, making Italy the third largest producer of
refrigerators in the world after the United States and Japan. Italy also became the largest
producer of washing-machines and dish-washers in Europe, with Candy producing one
washing-machine every fifteen seconds.
8
 As Italians’ income rose, so too did their
consumption of these products. In just four years, from 1959 to 1963, automobile
purchases rose by over a 500%, refrigerators by 400%, and televisions, which had been
only 88,000 in 1954, reached 634,000 units – a 720% increase.
9
Astounding as such figures may be, however, it is important to keep in mind that
they are not indicative of actualsocial development: if we look beyond how much was
produced to considerwhat was produced, we can see that one of the central aspects of
Italy’s economic miracle was the production of goods forprivateconsumption. The
introduction of laissez-faire capitalism was centered upon models of consumption that
were individual and familial and that entailed a general retreat of state spending that often
left collective, social needs unfulfilled
10
. General income may have increased, as did the
wealth of some Italians – but the gap between rich and poor actually widened as entire
sectors of the population and regions of the country were excluded from this “miracle.”
As Luciano Bianciardi sardonically reflected in his desecrating novel on the
economic miracle,La vita agra (1962),
È aumentata la produzione lorda e netta, il reddito nazionale cumulativo e pro
capite, l’occupazione assoluta e relativa, il numero delle auto in circolazione e
degli elettrodomestici in funzione, la tariffa delle ragazze squillo, la paga

del pollame, il tasso di sconto, l’età media, la statura media, la valetudinarietà

While Crainz takes issue with this summary judgment (xiii), recognizing important instances of
state intervention in areas such as the agrarian reform and the spread of public education, my judgment is
centered on the Republic’s “laissez-faire” approach to the public sector, which included health, housing,
and education, not to mention the problem of unemployment, all of which were aggravated by regional
discrepancies and mass emigration.

The “glass tower” Bianciardi’s character wanted to blow up was the headquarters of
petrochemical giant Montecatini (later to become Montedison), so representative of
Italy’s miracle but also of the corporate greed that caused the death of 43 miners in 1954.
Most important for our purposes here, however, is that the complacent recording
of averages and percentages dissimulates the reproduction of structural inequality
between North and South. While the Republic abandoned autarchic models of industrial
production in the North, it left the Fascist regime’s program of forced ruralization largely
unchanged in the South, thereby reconfirming the long-standing institutionalization of
inequality. Elsewhere in Europe, industrialization had introduced the mechanization of
the countryside, the rationalization of farming methods, and an intensification of
agricultural production that called for a gradual redistribution of the population to
agriculturally more productive areas. While this process had occurred in the northern
countryside, where the rural population had been largely incorporated within the
industrialization process, creating a mixed society of “contadini-operai,” it had been all
but absent in the South.
12
  Consequently, rather than resemble the migratory movements
generally associated with an industrial revolution, the abandonment of the southern
countryside that began in the mid 1950s assumed the aspect and proportions of a mass
evacuation.
The origins of this “forced migration,” as some scholars have called it,
13
 are
intrinsically tied to the birth of capitalism in Italy, which only fully takes off in this
period of postwar industrialization. More importantly, its rootedness in the forced
ruralization and de-industrialization
14
 of the South, which began under unitary
government but intensified during the Fascist regime and was perpetuated by the postwar

The foundational historical text on Italian agrarian capitalism is Emilio Sereni’sIl capitalismo
nelle campagne (1860-1900) (Torino: Einaudi, 1947), which traced the unevenness of Italy’s industrial
development to the lack of a capitalist revolution of agricultural processes. For more recent accounts, see
Camillo Daneo’sAgricoltura e sviluppo capitalistico in Italia(Torino: Einaudi, 1969) andBreve storia
dell’agricoltura italiana (Milano: Mondadori, 1980); Corrado Barberis,Gli operai contadini (Bologna: Il
Mulino, 1970), and the collection of essays in Angelo Varni, ed.,La campagna a vapore. La
meccanizzazione agricola nella Pianura Padana (Rovigo: Associazione Culturale Minelliana, 1990). For
more comprehensive histories of Italian agriculture, see Piero Bevilacqua, ed.,Storia dell’agricoltura

Bernardi, eds.,Studi sull’agricoltura italiana. Società rurale e modernizzazione (Milano: Feltrinelli, 1994).

14
 In their inquiry into the causes of internal migration, Alasia and Montaldi noted that economic
depression in the South was to be considered “piuttosto come prodotto dal divenire capitalistico nazionale
che come eredità di una situazione economica pre-mercantile. È noto quanto sia stata negativa l’influenza
dell’Unità nazionale nei confronti dell’industria del Sud, come ne abbia provocato lo smantellamento e la
decadenza. Tuttavia la diffusa concezione di un Sud semi-feudale è uno dei piú grotteschi prodotti della
consapevole ignoranza inaugurata dalla cultura riformista e da ciò che in Italia è consueto denominare
come ‘ideologia dei monopoli’[...] È sotto il profilo dello sviluppo del capitalismo nazionale che vanno
considerati gli effetti della mancata industrializzazione a Sud del Paese.” Alasia and Montaldi,Milano,
Corea, 17. A similar argument was advanced in his study on the causes of southern emigration by Fontani,
Gli emigrati, 71-72, and by Giuseppe Galasso in “Migrazioni e insediamenti nell’Italia meridionale,”Nord
e Sud VI, no.50 (1959).

Republic,

 suggests a historic reliance of Italian “free market” capitalism upon the
strengthening of industrial monopolies and the elimination of competition.
16
 Indeed, de-
industrialization and the creation of a “captive” (subservient) market is the very archetype
of colonial political economy. A classic example of this model was set by British
imperial rule in India, where a process of de-industrialization of India’s urban industry
was carried out through a tariff policy known as “one-way free trade” that rendered the
Indian market reliant on Britsh manufacturing exports.
17
 In his enormously influential
essay, “The Development of Underdevelopment” (1966),  economist Andre Gunder
Frank separated “undevelopment,” which is a natural state, from “underdevelopment,”
which instead forcibly creates backwardness, arguing that “underdevelopment is not due
to the survival of archaic institutions and the existence of capital shortage in regions that
have remained isolated from the stream of world history. On the contrary,
underdevelopment was and still is generated by the very same historical process which
also generated economic development: the development of capitalism itself.”
18
Frank’s analysis, which was later worked out in what has come to be known as
“dependency theory,” could not be more relevant to the Italian case. The creation of
underdevelopment was in fact the very basis of Antonio Gramsci’s theory of the Southern
Question. As he argued inSome Aspects of the Southern Question (1926), the disparities
between North and South were not due to some inherent backwardness of the latter, but
rather to the fact that “the Northern bourgeoisie has subjugated the South of Italy and the
Islands, and reduced them to exploitable colonies.”
19
 The result of northern capitalist
exploitation, southern “inferiority” could only be overcome through concerted political
struggle by an alliance of northern workers and southern peasants. Only this “national-
popular alliance,” as Gramsci called it, could ultimately emancipate both classes. More

While from 1871 to 1936 the national average saw a decrease of the population employed in the
“primary” sectors of agriculture, hunting and fishing from 58% to 48%, in the South this increased from
56% to 59%. For the same period, against a national increase of those employed in industry from 22% to
29%, in the South there was a decrease from 23% to 22%. See Alasia and Montaldi,Milano,Corea, 22.
From 1936 to the 1950s, while the tendency in the South follows the same direction of that in the North, its
“pace” is practically non-existent: from 1936 to 1951, the percentage of the northern population employed
in agriculture dropped from 42% to 33%, in the South the decrease was from 58% to 57%; and while the
northern population employed in industry between 1936 and 1951 rose from 35% to 40%, in the South the
rise was from 21% to 23% in the entire quarter century that ran from 1936 to 1960, at the height of the
boom. See Goffredo Fofi,L’immigrazione meridionale a Torino (Milano: Feltrinelli, 1964), 23.

 It is interesting to note that, in his urgent argument for African colonization, the nationalist
Enrico Corradini inadvertantly pointed to the need, for northern capitalist interests, to prevent the
industrialization of the South: “se pensiamo ad un Mezzogiorno industrializzato, tanto più dobbiamo
pensare a provvederci, quando l’occasione ci si porga, d’uno sbocco nostro in Affrica; ci debbono pensare
il Nord e il Sud: il Sud, perchè i prodotti delle sue industrie difficilmente potrebbero risalire verso il Nord e
superarlo; il Nord perchè nel Sud industrializzato avrebbe perduto il suo primo cliente, non solo, ma anche
entrerebbe con esso in concorrenza, dentro i confini dell’Italia chiusa e soffocata fra i suoi tre mari.”Enrico

than thirty years after Gramsci’s impassioned argument, institutionalized inequality was
still feeding northern industrial growth while preserving a colonial system of exploitation
in the South, which was to remain a captive market for northern industry rather than
become a potential competitor. According to postwar economist Vera Lutz, whose
neoliberal theories were often adopted by the Banca Centrale d’Italia, it would have been
too “dangerous” and a waste of resources to attempt to bridge the gap between North and
South. Rather, Italy should have pursued a “dual” system of “unequal development,”
which included instituting different salaries for North and South and encouraging
emigration from the South to mitigate the social pressures caused by high unemployment.
In Lutz’s view, the economy of the South had to be driven by emigrants’ remittances and
the export of agricultural products to a Mediterranean market, devolving the presumed
rise in income to the consumption of northern industrial goods.
20
Italian politicians needed southern votes, however, which they could only win by
promising a sweeping agrarian reform and a program of assistance for the South. In 1950,
these promises resulted in the Agrarian Reform and theCassa per il Mezzogiorno, a
state-run “fund for the South” that, on paper at least, was supposed to provide investment
assistance in and for the South. Appropriating an important part the Communist Party’s
agenda, the Christian Democrats made these reforms part of their campaign and won the
1948 elections. Both financially rooted in the ERP (European Recovery Program, or
“Marshall Plan”), the Agrarian Reform and the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno were also
expected to curtail Communist sympathies and quell the peasant agitations and land
occupations that had rocked the South in the postwar years.
21
 In practice, however, they
proved instrumental in consolidating  rather than eliminating the economic disparity
between North and South, prompting Giorgio Napolitano to claim in 1961 that “the
widening of the gap between North and South did not occurin spite of the government’s
politics for the South, butthanks to it.”
22
As part of the agrarian reform, over 700,000 hectares of abandoned or
“unimproved” land were expropriated and redistributed to some 120,000 peasant
families, while landowners were compensated by the state in the form of government
bonds. The land was not given to the peasants for free, however, for they had to pay for

12 (1974): 1348. For an overview in English of the Agrarian Reform, see Russell King,Land Reform: The
Italian Experience (London: Butterworth, 1973). One of the staunchest advocates of the reform was the
southern economist and politician Manlio Rossi-Doria, who explicated his position inRiforma agraria e
azione meridionalista (Napoli: L’Ancora del Mediterraneo, 2003); while historian and politician Rosario
Villari discussed the reform with respect to the emigration question in “La crisi del blocco agrario,” in
Istituto Gramsci, Togliatti e il Mezzogiorno, I, ed. Franco De Felice (Roma: Editori Riuniti, 1977). State
intervention in southern postwar economy forms the subject of Giuseppe Barone’s “Stato e Mezzogiorno

the effects of the Agrarian Reform and the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno intersect with popular memory of
peasant land struggles. For a wealth of information on the European Recovery Program, see the work of

the land in yearly instalments for the next 30 years. Needless to say, the land expropriated
was grossly insufficient to satisfy the masses of landless peasants in the South. Moreover,
much of the land allotted for redistribution had been abandoned and unimproved for a
reason, as it was located in mountainous or infertile areas with scarce or no irrigation.
Though the reform boards were supposed to provide peasants with assistance in
irrigation, housing, credit, and other technical matters, their assistance was applied very
unevenly, so that only land allotments considered most profitable – a miniscule minority
– were given assistance. The reform boards themselves, far from carrying out the
democratic ideals of the reform, discriminated against peasants believed to be Communist
militants or to have taken part in the land occupation movement. Moreover, the peasants
were given no representation on the reform boards, which were controlled by local
magnates and DC representatives. A case in point was in an area of Calabria, where one
of the great landowners affected by the reform, a relative of the Marquis of Tropea, not
only sat on the reform board but became its president. Continuing with the example of
Calabria, only 15 per cent of the area to be reformed was actually expropriated, and of
that, only some 10 per cent was located in the fertile coastal plains. Moreover, the
agrarian reform only dealt with the issue of land redistribution, leaving untouched all
other agrarian issues in need of redress, such as labor contracts, land improvement, and
labor conditions and wages.
23
As for the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno, the emphasis was on agriculture, as its chief
features were financing irrigation and land reclamation projects, road building, and
infrastructural construction. Industrialization, on the other hand, only constituted around
12% of its spending. “Such a choice also suited the interests of northern industry,”
Ginsborg has noted, given that it “provided the heavy machinery and materials needed for
infrastructural construction.”
24
 In 1960, a Parliamentary Committee on the South
published a report on the Cassa’s achievements 10 years after its creation. It found that
income remained shockingly low and that in both agriculture and industry, the regions of
the South were at a standstill: from 1951 to 1959, industrial production had increased
from 14.9% to 15.1%. This negligible growth was moreover due to the construction
sector, and not the crucial manufacturing sector, which had instead declined from 14.9%
to 12.7%.
25
 Consequently, far from bridging the gap between North and South, the
Agrarian Reform and Cassa per il Mezzogiorno served to cement it, especially in the
critical years of Italian economic growth. By leaving the ownership of the means of
production largely intact, these state programs continually reprodueced the South’s
“underdevelopment.”
Internal Migration
Not surprisingly, poverty and unemployment in the South continued to soar to
alarming rates. As the 1954 parliamentary inquest on poverty demonstrated, 85% of
Italy’s poverty-stricken families were to be found in the South.

consolidated Italian tradition, remained the only viable alternative to certain poverty. In
spite of Italy’s miraculous takeoff, therefore, emigration abroad increased from 347,000
persons per year in the mid 1950s to an average of 388,000 persons between 1958 and
1963
27
. Italy was the only “booming” country in Europe with such a population loss, as
other expanding economies in Europe needed all the labor they could get: Germany
absorbed the greatest share, but Switzerland, France and Belgium also experienced mass
immigration – from Italyin primis.
28
Yet foreign migration during these years pales by comparison with the internal
migration movement flowing mostly from South to North. Between 1955 and 1970, over
9 million Italians migrated from one region to another. In the North, migration entailed
movement from the rural areas (especially of the Veneto) to the Industrial Triangle of the
northwest. In the Center it consisted largely of movement from countryside to city within
the same region. But in the South migration was a veritable exodus from the entire
southern half of the peninsula.
29
 Moreover, in contrast to other forms of postwar
migration (transcontinental and European), internal migration involved entire families
and was permanent. Hence, in both size and duration it proved to be the most massive
migration experience to affect southern Italy.
Unlike the immediate postwar years, the Italian government took no part in
officially encouraging or administering this migration flow. However, given the
persistent difficulties of life in the South, the population awaited neither assistance nor
endorsement by the government. Yet even the “solution” provided by internal migration
was fraught with obstacles, not least of which was the 1939 Fascist law against
urbanization. Part of the “back to the earth” mythology
30
 that had accompanied the
regime’s culture of autarchy, the anti-urbanization law was essentially a protectionist
measure intended to shield northern industrial workers from rural migration by
redirecting the latter to its imperial wars instead. The law worked like a “catch 22”: in
order for emigrants to officially change their place of residence, without which they could
not have full access to government housing, schooling and health care programs, the
emigrants had to demonstrate to have secured employment in the new place of residence;
yet in order for them to be hired by an employer, they must already be officially
resident.
31
Until its repeal in 1961, the anti-urbanization law was the single greatest stress
factor afflicting emigrants. Their position with respect to this law determined every
aspect of their lives, from housing to employment to their chances of being joined by

 The “back to the earth” movement was an anti-modern ruralization campaign that included the
battle for wheat, land reclamation programs, and laws against the movement of people from rural to urban
areas. Such a “return to the land,” it was argued – by Mussolini especially (“we must ruralize Italy, even if
it needs millions and takes half a century”) – could combat the sterile effects of modern industrial society
and restore the supposedly healthy qualities of a rural lifestyle. See Paul Corner, “Fascist agrarian policy

Davis (London: Croom Helm, 1979), 241.

67
their families. In all aspects that mattered, the law effectively excluded migrants from any
kind of integration – social, political or cultural. The anti-urbanization law kept them in a
permanent state of “irregularity.” When asked what residency accomplished and why
they desired it, most emigrants referred to the importance for them of becoming a
“regularized” component of the local society. Other considerations, like qualifying for
government assistance programs or being able to vote, while important, were secondary
to their need to “be in the law” (“essere in regola”). Acquiring residency amounted to
nothing less than being officially recognized as a citizen and thus obtaining equality at
least before the law.
32
 If finding work and having their families join them in the North
was the first battle the emigrants won within the miracle society, the obtainment of
residency was the crowning achievement; it was the single most important instrument in
their efforts to leave the margins and enter the metropole’s centrifugal force.
Yet for almost the entire duration of the economic miracle, the anti-urbanization
law ensured that millions of emigrants, given their clandestine condition, were excluded
from mainstream society and constituted the most exploitable sector of the working
population. Indeed, one is lead to wonder if Italy’s economic recovery would have been
quite so miraculous were it not for the precarious condition of so much of its working
class. Most southern emigrants, finding themselves in a position of illegality and lacking
qualified skills as well as labor union representation, often filled the hardest labor
positions, especially in the building industry. Moreover, their flooding of the labor
market also weakened the bargaining power of the local “official” workers, aggravating
the already existing anti-southern discriminat ion.
33
 In essence, the economic miracle
could not have taken place without the competitiveness that a vast supply of cheap labor
guaranteed northern industry. The South’s poverty, work hunger and migration was thus
as much a motor of the economic miracle as it was an effect.
The Nation and the Internal Other
Internal migration was not instrumental only for the nation’s industrial production
but also for its figurative reproduction. Predictably, Italy’s anxiety to achieve the long
overdue status of a “modern,” prosperous nation drove it to define itself once more
through the foil of “backwardness” traditionally allotted to the South. Consequently, the
emigrant figure registered an important shift: gone was that redemptive function so
crucial to Italy’s postwar material and moral reconstruction. The emigrants, especially if
from the South, returned to serve as the negation of modernity. With their poverty and
“backwardness,” southern emigrants represented what the modern sector of Italy was no
longer – a nation of peasants. Already marginalized socially and economically, migrants
were also pushed out of the nation’s imaginary borders through a process of displacement
that was both spatial and temporal.
With the advent of internal migration, the imaginary borders demarcating the
modern nation had shifted accordingly. Where once they were perceived as lying along
the Alps or in some vague spot south of Rome (let us recall that for Carlo Levi Christ had

 A precedent for today’s Northern League can be found in Turin as early as 1956, with the
formation of an extreme-Right political movement, the “Movimento per l’Autonomia della Regione
Piemontese,” that used “local pride” rhetoric to predicate virulent anti-southernism. See Alasia and
Montaldi,Milano, Corea, 33.

stopped at Eboli), the “front” of modernity now rose up around the burgeoning cities of
Italy, especially in the industrial North. The movement form colonial periphery to center
was akin to what was taking place in other European nations in the aftermath of World
War II with respect to their former colonies. In “The National Longing for Form,”
Timothy Brennan has pointed out that “the wave of postwar immigration to the imperial
‘centers’ – including in England the influx of large numbers of non-white people from
Africa and the Caribbean, and in America, from Asia and Latin America – amounted to
what Gordon Lewis calls ‘a colonialism in reverse’ – a new sense of what it means to be
‘English’. To a lesser extent, the same has happened in France.”
34
 We can extend
Brennan’s observation to postwar Italy as well, interpreting internal migration as the
movement of the nation’s internal colonial Other from margin to center. Here, the
emigrants’ alterity was constructed through a clear demarcation of territory: the more the
cities to which migrants converged were contrasted against the cordons of shanty towns
they inhabited, the more these metropolises found and constructed the visual
confirmat ion of their modernit y.
These ghettos appeared almost overnight as the peasantry abandoned the
countryside en-masse and poured into urban centers. Though between 1951 and 1961
Italy’s population increased by 3 million, in the same time span 70 percent of its
communes registered a population decline. However, between 1951 and 1971, the
number ofcity dwellers almost doubled, growing from 9 million to 16 million. In Genoa
and Turin, southern emigrants would arrive at 9:50 every morning on thetreno del sole
(“the sunshine train”), from which young workers would be hired by shrewd recruiters
waiting for them on the platform. Typically filled to overflowing, during the busier
months there would be another one arriving ten minutes later.
35
Not all of Italy’s urban growth was due to industrialization, however. Often, the
migrants’ abandonment of the peasant way of life did not spell immediate entry into the
industrial world. In the North, the jobs offered by industry, especially big industry, were
typically filled by northern workers first; it was the jobs vacated by these, sometimes in
agriculture, but for the most part in construction work or other hard manual labor, that the
largely unqualified southern emigrants filled. In addition to the industrial cities of the
North, the provincial and regional capitals of Italy that served as bureaucratic and
administrative hubs, such as Rome but also other cities of the South such as Naples, Bari,
Palermo, and so on, also witnessed an incredible population growth.
Between 1871 and 1961, the population of Rome had increased from 250,000 to 2
million.
36
   However, this growth was not due to industrialization, for Rome had been
kept intentionally devoid of industries for social rather than for economic reasons. As
Quintino Sella, minister of finance and staunch supporter of making Rome Italy’s capital,
once declared in a Parliamentary speech, “io ho sempre desiderato che sia in Roma la
parte direttiva, la parte intellettuale, ma non ho mai desiderato che vi siano grandi
agglomerazioni di operai . In una soverchia agglomerazione di operai in Roma io vedrei
un inconveniente, perché credo che qui [...] non sarebbero opportuni gli impeti popolari

di grandi masse di operai.”
37
  By the time the Fascists seized power, thesventramenti
took care to also remove much of the subproletariat from the city center.
38
 Left homeless,
these residents were relocated to the periphery in housing complexes built especially for
them, the so-calledborgate, which take their name from the self-sufficient country
boroughs they were meant to emulate. Theborgate remained the most significant element
of the expansion of Rome’s population, both before and after the war.
After 1948, theborgate continued to be built to house a veritable army of
construction workers needed for the city’s expansion as well as to absorb the influx of
emigrants moving to Rome from the South and the surrounding countryside. Theborgate
thus became the very symbol of the rural migration to Rome, and typically formed a
chain of slums surrounding the city like an enormous ring. This was where most of the
“unofficial” and legally “irregular” population settled.
For the most part, however, the great majority of rural migrants moved to the
industrial cit ies of the North.
39
 Yet Italy’s major cities were caught unprepared by this
population explosion, and demonstrated gross inefficiency in providing adequate housing
solutions. In some cases, the unpreparedness was intentional, a result of pressures exerted
upon local governments by industrial monopolies that had much to gain from maintaining
a wide sector of the population in precarious, and thus highly exploitable, conditions.
40
Moreover, the willingness of the weaker sections of the labor force to fill in during strike
actions conveniently curtailed the bargaining power of local workers, further increasing
industries’ profit margins.
In Genoa, emigrants made up nearly 70% of the population living in the shanty-
towns mushrooming around the city.
41
 In Turin, most immigrants settled in the
neighborhood of Porta Palazzo, in the attics and basements vacated by the local
inhabitants who had moved to the suburbs. Most immigrants were part of a migration
chain: they arrived already knowing friends or relatives who had preceded them and who
could offer hospitality for a few days until they found their own accommodation. But
housing in Turin became progressively more expensive and difficult to find as migration

 “Sventramento” literally means “gutting out.” Beginning in 1931, an entire medieval quarter in
the center of Rome was demolished in order to open up a more majestic vista onto Rome’s imperial past. A
road was built, Via dell’Impero (today Via dei Fori Imperiali), running through the ancient imperial
forums, connecting Piazza Venezia, with its monument to Victor Emmanuel and the Fascist headquarters,
to the Coliseum in a grandiose trajectory that also served to visually and ideologically connect the grandeur
of Rome’s imperial past to the aims of the Fascist state. For more on this aspect of the Fascist era, see
Antonio Cederna,Mussolini urbanista: lo sventramento di Roma negli anni del consenso (Bari: Laterza,
1980).

 In absolute numbers, the regions that lost most residents were Puglia, Sicily and Campania,
while those who lost the greatest percentage of their population were Puglia, Abruzzi, Molise, Basilicata,
and Calabria. See Fofi,L’immigrazione, 20. As limited as vital statistics calculations were for indicating the
actual size of the internal migration flow, their figures at the end of 1958 still manage to convey the
enormity of this phenomenon: On the positive end of the balance, the chief  regions registering new
residency requests were Liguria (+36.5%), Valle d’Aosta (+30%), Lombardy (+21.5%),  Piedmont
(+19.7%), and Lazio (+17.4%). On the negative end, the chief regions registering residency cancellations
were Calabria (-40.3%), Basilicata (-35.3%), Puglia (-31.4%), Abruzzo and Molise (-31.1%), Veneto (–
23.3%), Sicily (-20.9%), Friuli-Venezia Giulia (–11.4%), Marches (–17.6%), Umbria (-14.6%),  and
Campania (-14.5%). See Alasia and Montaldi,Milano, Corea, 38.

eventually filled all available space. With increasing frequency, new arrivals ended up in
pensions or taverns that catered to them, or, if they ran out of money, on a bench at the
train station, where they staved off the guards with a ticket to the next town. During the
summer months, when even station benches came in short supply, emigrants sometimes
slept in the park.
42
 By 1960, it had became virtually impossible to find any sort of
housing in the saturated market, and nearby neighborhoods had already made it clear that
southerners were not welcome.
Unless electorally motivated, Italian government officials’ attention to internal
migration tended to be minimal. Within intellectual circles, journalistic inquests paid
much greater attention to the phenomenon. Of these, two texts in particular were
fundamental for shaping public opinion on the matter. Composed partly of interviews
conducted among immigrant communities in Milan and Turin, Alasia and Montaldi’s
Milano, Corea (1960) and Goffredo Fofi’sL’immigrazione meridionale a Torino (1964)
are still today valuable sources of information on Italy’s postwar internal migration.
Milano, Corea / Milano, Italia
Largely a socio-historical analysis of southern emigration,Milano, Corea was
very influential in relocating the nation’s imaginary frontier to the periphery of Milan. At
the height of the miracle, room rental signs and advertisements in Turin and Genoa had
begun explicitly to reject southerner tenants. In Milan this was less of an issue because
the great majority of emigrants settled into areas on the far outskirts of the city, where
they built their own ghettos. Like other cities, Milan had been caught entirely unprepared
for the migration phenomenon, having taken hardly any of the housing, schooling, or
health care measures required to accommodate the additional population.
43
 To make
matters worse, rising real estate prices had made the city off-limits even to the local
working poor, some of whom had to move so far from their place of work that they had
to rise as early as 4 a.m. to make the commute. The new emigrants began to settle in the
area north of Milan, where outlying communes had been swallowed up by the city’s
expanding suburbs. Because this occurred contemporaneously with the Korean war, these
new ghettos came to be calledCoree (“Koreas”). Here, emigrants would purchase small
plots of land upon which they would work during the night to build little houses. Calling
them “houses,” however, was at times a bit of a stretch: in the town of Bollate, just
outside Milan, twelve families were found to be living in a basement no higher than a
meter off the ground.
44
 Though this may have been an extreme case, the average emigrant
dwelling was hardly an improvement. Alasia and Montaldi’s study described in vivid
detail how emigrants’ homes started out:
La casa nasce come un cubo di cemento, ma quello che si vede di fuori non dice
niente; la casa comincia dalla cantina, è la cantina che permette la costruzione
della casa, perché viene subito affittata ad una famiglia che non ha tutti i soldi per
potersela costruire da sola; una famiglia vive in affitto in cantina, la famiglia del
padrone di casa a pian terreno: sono due stanze e un bugigattolo, o una stanza con

una tramezza. L’anno dopo, se le cose vanno bene, l’immigrato ha fatto un primo
piano, nel quale andrà subito ad abitare. Gli inquilini della cantina saliranno a
pian terreno e la cantina verrà ceduta in subaffitto ad una nuova famiglia appena
arrivata.
45
Milano, Corea brings the contours of Italy’s economic boom into sharp focus. The title
itself suggests these contours by juxtaposing the epitome of the industrial city with a
place imagined as marginal, linguistically conveying the clash between the industrial
nation and its pre-modern Other: “Milano, la metropoli del lusso, l’opulenza, il lavoro,
l’avvenire. Corea, la miseria, la fame, la degradazione, la morte.”
46
 The name given to
these suburban ghettos also suggests that the “foreignness” of its inhabitants was so
complete as to evoke populations of the Far East. Local residents rarely interacted with
the inhabitants of the Koreas in any way, for in the words of the authors, “agli occhi dei
residenti nei paesi dell’Alto Milanese, gli immigrati si presentavano certamente come
degli esuli, dei profughi, come ‘gente che aveva perduto la guerra.’”
47
The text’s description of the “Koreas” emphasizes the segregation that separated
the emigrants not only from the society of the metropole but also from themselves, for
what was immediately striking about these ghettos was the extent to which their
architecture reflected the atomized life of the immigrants. Having left behind a communal
way of life, they found themselves in a society that prized individualism and did not favor
communal forms of interaction beyond the familial circle. The new emigrants thus found
themselves architecturally primed for a life of alienation:
La Corea nasce come un insieme di casette monofamiliari popolate al massimo,
esempi di architettura spontanea, col tetto quelle dei veneti, a terrazzo quelle dei
meridionali [...] Nella disposizione topografica delle prime Coree, si rileva una
più profonda intenzione di distacco, un maggior senso del privato. Se la prima
casa è disposta frontalmente, la seconda è stata fatta apposta per un altro verso,
così che finestre e porte non si affrontino. C’è dentro questo rifiuto di
familiarizzare il contraccolpo dell’esperienza precedente: meglio non avere
rapporti con gli altri; e poi non ci si vuol riconoscere nella situazione che si ha di
fronte; il problema è personale, è quello della famiglia, della casa, del lavoro
continuo di sistemazione della nuova abitazione. Una casa di fronte, una di
traverso, una di fianco, una isolata, nasce la Corea, lontana, disorganica,
disagiata, una frazione del paese che non ha ancora un nome ufficiale, senza
strade, senza servizi. Quando i vuoti saranno stati riempit i salterà fuori un intrico
di vicoli; i vicoli prima delle strade.
48
Alasia and Montaldi’s analysis brought to light a process of national definition
occurring along peripheral urban space in a process of social mapping that was a
derivative of Italy’s internal colonial history. It also advanced a critique of the social and
moral segregation intrinsic to neocapitalism. The isolation and radical individualism that
suddenly characterized the life of emigrants to Milan rendered their co-optation more
easily achievable, and the hegemonizing power of neocapitalism all the more powerful,
while continuing to exclude emigrants economically and politically. In the Koreas settled

by the emigrants, there was no “historic center,” no sense of community, no class
solidarity. As Alasia and Montaldi concluded, every Korea was “una città ottenutaper
esclusione.”

 – the nation negating its Other.
From Clan to Nation: Fofi’sL’immigrazione Meridionale a Torino
The other classic text on internal migration, Goffredo Fofi’sL’immigrazione
meridionale a Torino, examines emigration to Turin, the other northern city
representative of the miracle. Having traveled to Sicily to join Danilo Dolci during the
season of the southern peasantry’s land occupations and “reverse strikes,”
50
 Fofi had
witnessed firsthand the push factors behind southern emigration.
51
 After his work on
southern emigration to Turin, Fofi went on to become a chief figure in Italian literary and
film criticism.
Where Alasia and Montaldi’s study had focused on thespaces where the Italian
nation constructed its internal Other, Fofi’s analysis gave the frontier of emigration a
temporal dimension. The surveys conducted among Turin’s southern emigrants in the
early 1960s, on which Fofi’s research was largely based, served to point the readers’
attention to the emigrants’ pre-modern system of values, to a primitiveness rooted in an
unhealthy culture of “familism.”
The concept of familism, so instrumental for excluding the emigrant from the
modern time of the nation, was coined in 1958, the inaugural year of Italy’s economic
miracle, in Edward Banfield’sThe Moral Basis of a Backward Society, a pseudo-
sociological treatise on southern cultural inferiority that was to become very influent ial.
 52
This Carlo Levi-inspired work was conducted, not surprisingly, in Basilicata, and focused
on the life of peasant families in the small town of “Montegrano.”

 These were a sort of “work-in” form of non-violent protest in which landless peasants or
unemployed workers would set to work on abandoned plots of land or neglected roads and improve them.
51
 For Fofi’s account of these experiences, refer hisStrana gente. 1960: un diario tra Sud e Nord
(Roma: Donzelli, 1993).
52
 InBorgata Milanese (Milano: Franco Angeli, 1963), Leone Diena made use of both spatial and
temporal categories that produced the migrant Other, examining the familism of  immigrant communities in
a corea at Cologno Monzese and concluding that the corea was a “primitive” and “barbaric” society (p.
144). More recently, inMaking Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy (Princeton, NJ:
Princeton University Press, 1993), Robert D. Putnam emphasized profound divisions still separating Italian
regions on the basis of differing notions of social and political commitment; John Foot discussed the issue
of familism amongst southern immigrants in the North during the miracle in his “Il boom dal basso:
famiglia, trasformazione sociale, lavoro, tempo libero e sviluppo alla Bovisa e Comasina (Milano), 1950-
1970,” inTra fabbrica e società. Mondi operai nell’Italia del Novecento (Milano: Feltrinelli, 1999); and as
recently as 2009, inL’Italia fatta in casa (Milano: Mondadori, 2009), economists Alberto Alesina and
Andrea Ichino have reproposed the validity of Banfield’s thesis to explain persistent underdevelopment and
organized crime in southern Italy. Opponents of Banfield’s thesis have included Carlo Tullio Altan, who
argued inLa nostra Italia (Milano: Feltrinelli, 1986) that the phenomenon of familism not only was
widespread throughout Italy, but also had roots sinking far back in the nation’s ancient history, while
Loredana Sciolla argued inItaliani.Stereotipi di casa nostra (Bologna: Il Mulino, 1997) that familism need
not be interpreted as a strictly negative phenomenon that stands opposed to solidarity and the collective
good, and also cited research that would contradict the existence of familism exclusively in the South.
53
 In his acknowledgments, Banfield thanks “Professor Manlio Rossi-Doria of the Scuola Agraria
in Portici [and] Farrar, Straus, Cudahy, Inc., publishers of Carlo Levi’sChrist Stopped at Eboli, for
permission to quote from that book.” Edward Banfield,The Moral Basis of a Backward Society (Glencoe,
IL: Free Press, 1958), 12. Levi’s influence is evident even in the author’s choice of names for the region.

73
observations of life in the village led him to formulate the thesis that the South’s poverty
and supposed backwardness were due to “the inability of the villagers to act together for
their common good or, indeed, for any end transcending the immediate, material interest
of the nuclear family.” Banfield named this inability to develop an ethos beyond the
circle of the immediate family “amoral familism.”
54
Characteristics of the “amoral familist” include disregarding the interests of the
group or community; maintaining hope of material gain in the short-run as the only
guiding motive for action; lacking concern for civic improvement or public affairs;
harboring no identification with, or loyalty to, organizations or groups that do not bring
material gains; taking no initiatives (“The nearest approximation to leadership is the
patron-client relationship”
55
); unscrupulously and selfishly pursuing self-interests;
disregarding the law since there is no fear of punishment; and engaging in generally
cynical and corrupt behavior such as taking bribes, selling votes, and so on. In short, the
amoral familist’s exclusive attachment is to the family, where the adult “exists not as
‘ego’ but as ‘parent.’”
56
Banfield’s proposed solution was to have “among them [the Montegranesi] for
two or three decades a couple of dozen middle and upper class families who felt a sense
of civic responsibility and who would serve [...] as teachers and leaders.”
57
  Naturally,
this leading class would need to come from outside the community not only in terms of
class but also of geography. By his own admission, what Banfield was suggesting was
analogous to the “protestant missionary activity”
58
 that had accompanied a great deal of
British colonization, a sort of northern civilizing mission in the amoral familist South.
Banfield’s study lacked a structural analysis, which would have contradicted his
theory of southern primitivism and civic turpitude, and it denied poverty as a leading
cause since the southern peasant ultimately “uses his poverty as an excuse for not doing
what he would not do anyway.”
59
 With his characterization of backwardness as inherent
in southernculture, Banfield shifted upon “culture” the discrimination that in colonial
discourse had traditionally been imputed to “race,” a maneuver that also entailed denying
historical processes. Indeed, Banfield even ignored the southern peasants’ land
occupation movement that, through solidarity and concerted collective action, would
have constituted the most obvious contradiction to his theory of amoral familism.
Though Banfield did not apply his theory to emigrants, convinced that amoral
familism was so pervasive as to discourage southerners from emigrating, the discourse of
familism strongly influenced intellectual debate and public opinion over internal
migration. A good section of Fofi’sL’immigrazione meridionale a Torino is in fact
devoted to denouncing southern immigrants’ familistic tendencies, focusing on gender
and inter-generational conflict within immigrant families and the social conflicts
generated by the migrants’ excessive attachment to their families. Fofi also seemed to
Because the Fascist regime had renamed it with the archaic term “Lucania,” the region had been officially
renamed Basilicata after the war and appeared as Basilicata in the Italian Constitution in 1948. However, a
good ten years later, it still appears as Lucania in Banfield’s account.

echo Banfield in concluding that through prolonged exposure to northern values, southern
emigrants could break out of their cultural backwardness and step fully into the modern
nation.
Fofi’s work was nonetheless valuable for illustrating the fundamental role of the
family in emigrant settlements in Turin.  The “integration” of the emigrants depended
virtually exclusively on the support of a family structure offering assistance and
solidarity, as government assistance and charity organizations were all but absent in
emigrants’ experiences. The family structure was thus central for both the material and
moral support of emigrants in an environment so alien and indifferent to them, when not
downright hostile. From the problem of housing – which was the first and most serious
issue to solve, given that without adequate housing immigrants could not be joined by
their own families – to the search for employment, immigrants relied on a network of
support that was family-centered, even when this support came from friends rather than
direct relatives. It was, for instance, through word-of-mouth and family relations that
immigrants found work, and never through the employment office.
60
 Families thus
offered the only assistance and comfort available to the emigrants.
Yet if the family was the basis of the southerners’ initial survival in the northern
cities, familism was seen as the obstacleto their complete integration. One of the terms
with which Fofi introduced the discourse of familism was that of “clan,” by which he
indicated the extended family. The term’s connotation of primitive, even prehistorical
familial and social relations, was fundamental for setting the scene for the discourse of
familism.
To begin with, the emigrants’ ties to their clan are shown to conflict with the
solidary working relations they could build in the factory. Southerners who had been in
the North longer and were employed in big industry had “clearer ideas and motivation,”
while those newly arrived “non hanno ancora raggiunto un grado di distacco nei confronti
degli altri perché non lo hanno ancora nei propri confronti, e perché c’è un rapporto di
immedesimazione che agli altri li lega. [...] Col tempo, le osservazioni diventano
relativamente più profonde, e indicano già un certo distacco tra l’individuo e il gruppo
cui si sa di appartenere.”
61
 The clan was thus shown to form an obstacle to identification
with and participat ion in the emancipatory social struggles of a modern societ y.
Among southerners who had gone from being peasants to proletarians, typically
those who had been in Turin the longest, integration involved a rejection of other
emigrants, and more specifically of the clan: “tra gli operai di fabbriche medie e grandi
[...] c’è un certo distacco dal gruppo meridionale in generale, il rifiuto di parentele
troppo strette.”
62
 Rejecting the clan meant placing greater distance between oneself and
one’s family, but also annihilating one’s identity as a southerner by aping the locals, as
one emigrant admitted to doing: “Io cerco di seguire le regole di Torino, di diventare
uguale agli altri e passare inosservato. Mi piace stare con gli amici del mio paese, ma
capisco che, se voglio diventare uguale a tutti, devo diventare come i settentrionali.”
63
According to Fofi, however, the gravest threat posed to modern society by
southern familism was thedelitto d’onore (the murder of one’s spouse, usually the wife,
60
 Fofi,L’immigrazione, 107.
61
 Ibid., 240.
62
 Ibid., 252.
63
 Ibid., 240-41.

75
for reasons of “honor”), a practice which Fofi believed the emigrants shed with prolonged
exposure to northern culture: “la cultura del proprio ambiente d’origine lo giudica valido,
e anzi considera inetto chi, avendone i motivi, non lo compie. Non ci si stupisce, dunque,
se, man mano che ci si allontana dal ristretto ambiente paesano e si allentano i legami dal
proprio clan, e nello stesso tempo si risente del nuovo ambiente e della nuova cultura, il
numero di questi delitti diminuisce, e le opinioni dei meridionali in proposito cambiano
radicalmente anche se con molta più lentezza di altre.”
64
 However, Fofi does not supply
any data to indicate the actual pervasiveness of the crime of honor in any region of Italy
or among southern emigrants in the North.  The author’s lengthy treatment of the subject
appears all the more suspect given that he himself admitted that the majority of emigrants
interviewed were adamantly against it.
65
 Moreover, Italian social values in general, but
especially those pertaining to gender relations, though changing, were still deeply steeped
in patriarchy. To take but one example, at the time of Fofi’s writing, the Italian legal code
still penalized wives, but not husbands, for the crime of adultery, with imprisonment for
up to two years.
66
Ultimately, emigrants were a threat to the nation because they demonstrated an
excessive attachment to their family and retained a “clannish” mentality that could not be
harnassed for the reproduction of a modern, industrialized nation. According to Fofi’s
logic, only prolonged exposure to northern society could transform southerners from
peasants to proletarians, from Montegranesi to Italians.
  The family’s relationship to the state has always been an important element of national
formation. As Eugen Weber wrote with regards to 19th century France, “the old age of
landed-clan alliances was giving way to a new age in which marriage associated the
working partners as individuals, rather than members of a clan. The family at the center
of production had been maintained by necessities inherent in the mode of production to
which it was bound. It disintegrated when and where the demands of production altered,
or where the center of production shifted to factory, shop, or office, so that family
cohesion seemed less important.”
67
However, in the passage from clan to nation, Etienne Balibar identified another
crucial ingredient besides the development of capitalism, and that was the idea of a
common “race.” Balibar also examined the important role of the family in the creation of
the nation. For Balibar, however, the logic of filiation implicit in the nation hinged upon
the myth of a common race. We are all “brothers” because “our” nation, our community,
is essentially “a circle of extended kinship.”
68
 Balibar believed it was precisely this idea
of race that formed the ideological foundation of the modern nation. Even more
significant for our purposes here, Balibar specified that “the idea of a racial community
makes its appearance when the frontiers of kinship dissolve at the level of the clan, the
neighborhood community and, theoretically at least, the social class, to be imaginarily
transferred to the threshold of nationality.”
69
 The nation as a (racial) community can thus
only exist there where the pre-modern, pre-national forms of aggregation of “clan” and

“tribe” have been overcome and no longer constitute an obstacle to individuals’
identification with wider, abstract relations of kinship. The clan and tribe are thus
“archaic forms of community which are [...] incompatible with the nation-state (this can
be clearly seen from the incompleteness of the formation of a nation wherever powerful
lineal or tribal solidarities still exist).”
70
There is an historically established correlation, Balibar argued, between the
dissolution of clan relations and the intrusion of the nation-state into family relations:
[A]s lineal kinship, solidarity between generations and the economic functions of
the extended family dissolve, what takes their place is [...] a nationalization of
the family, which has as its counterpart the identification of the national
community with a symbolic kinship, circumscribed by rules of pseudo-
endogamy, and with a tendency not so much to project itself into a sense of
having common antecedents as a feeling of having common descendents.
71
With their “amoral familism,” their excessive attachment to alternate relations of
kinship and no sense of belonging to an abstract national community, southern emigrants
thus posed a threat to Italian national formation: their “amoral familism” is a cause for
alarm insofar as it constitutes a sort of a-national form of cohesion that places them
outside the nation’s racial community, marking them not only as anarchic and deviant but
also as racially suspect.
Fofi’s argument for southern “integration” through the abandonment of familism
and entry into the life of the nation-factory, and his discussion of the perils of clan
mentality inherent in such practices as the “delitto d’onore,” thus hark back to traditional
representations in which emigrants posed a danger to the nation. Nor were Fofi’s
arguments circumscribed within the field of the social sciences, for his study bore close
ties with Luchino Visconti’s 1960 film,Rocco e i suoi fratelli. This is not surprising,
given Fofi’s interest in film in general and in this film in particular, which led him to
write the introduction of a 2010 monograph on Visconti’sRocco e i suoi fratelli.
72
 Fofi’s
study may have been influenced by Visconti’s earlier film, but more likely and more
significantly, the close relation between two works in such diverse fields indicates that
both Fofi and Visconti were both working within a broader nationalizing discourse
shaped by the concept of familism. What is certain is that with its focus on the
anachronism presented by the emigrants’ familism in a city like Turin, Fofi’s work
proved instrumental in adding a temporal dimension to the role that the emigrant figure
played in reshaping Italian national identity during the years of the economic miracle.

images of a nation blessed by the economic miracle. By the very nature of the messages
conveyed, representations of the miracle were necessarily representations of the nation.
The fact that the economic miracle coincided with the centenary of the nation’s founding
boosted the ideological power of images celebrating Italy’s rags-to-riches story,
bestowing upon the miracle a teleological function in narratives of national destiny. The
titles of Dino Risi’s films alone during these years are enough to suggest the trajectory of
this narrative, spanning fromUna vita difficile (1961) toIl sorpasso (1962) andIl
successo (1963). This is not to suggest a facile conquest of neocapitalist hegemony,
however, as many films of the miracle, especially thecommedie all’italiana, captured the
ambivalence of social development and dysfunction. As Peter Bondanella has argued,
Italian comedies of the miracle combined a cynical sense of humor with despair,
“lay[ing] bare an undercurrent of social malaise and the painful contradictions of a
culture in rapid transformation,” thus offering a darker social vision than was expressed
in neorealist comedies.
74
 At the same time, however, the proliferation of beach movies,
road movies and musicals that appealed to younger audiences elaborated socio-ethical
models of behavior in sync with the requirements of the new culture of consumption.
75
Not only did the content of such films reflect this celebration of new wealth, but even the
standards of physical beauty embodied by a new generation of film stars were indicative
of increased consumption. As Mary P. Wood has argued, during these years the “desire
for prosperity is inscribed on the body of the female protagonists.”
76
 The link between the
female body and the nation’s economy is structured within Italian language itself, where
well-endowed women are referred to asprosperose (“prosperous”). The female figures
thus “literally embody prosperity. Their curvaceous, fleshy bodies, their little tummies,
full lips and expressive eyes suggest a society that can go beyond the basic preoccupation
of obtaining enough to eat, and has the energy to conquer a place in society, nice clothes,
a fridge, and a new cinquecento.”
77
The top box office successes for 1960,
78
 however, were hardly unambiguous
celebrations of the economic miracle: Federico Fellini’s rather bitterLa dolce vita
conveyed all the existential pitfalls along Italy’s path to prosperity, while Luchino
Visconti’sRocco e i suoi fratelli explored the tragic underside of the economic miracle,
with its accompanying mass migration and cultural demise of the southern peasantry.
Whethercommedie all’italiana or melodramas, Italian films of the 1950s and
1960s were filled with portrayals of the family. Because melodrama projects social
problems onto the private sphere, it is a genre especially suited for family representations.

78
In turn, the family, because typically represented as threatened by outside forces, is both
identified with the state of the nation and often used for affirming or contesting traditions
and social practices. Since neocapitalism restructures the economy around private
consumption, the family becomes an important source of identity that mediates between
individuals and social apparatuses. Cinematic representations of the family thus bear an
intimate relationship with the construction of the nation.
Having fizzled out in the “rosy” variety of the 1950s, neorealism resurfaced into a
second, “post-neorealist”
79
 phase in this period, recapturing some of the critical urgency
that had given birth to it. The guiding motifs of this second wave were not wartime
suffering and material deprivation but rather the moral, spiritual, and, at least for Pier
Paolo Pasolini, anthropological consequences of the economic miracle.
Admittedly, the cinema of Pasolini and the later Visconti are not easily
characterizable as “neorealist.” However, this only holds true if we apply to neorealism a
rigid definition. Film historian Carlo Lizzani, for instance, believes that while neorealist
cinema drew to a close with the eclipse of typically postwar concerns, such as peasant
land struggles, foreign emigration, unemployment and the political reconstruction of
Italy, he nonetheless concedes that it is appropriate to extend the neorealist label to those
representations of marginality still occurring against an urban background “made up of
sidewalks, cheap dance halls, and shacks.”
80
 According to this criterion, a cinema
focusing on the disparities caused by the so-called miracle and zeroing in on the human
suffering and moral turpitude it concealed as much as required can thus be considered a
sort of extension of neorealism. The paradox of Italy’s politics of development, according
to which a great deal of the nation’s “underdevelopment” was the inherent component of
its “development,” offered a wealth of subject matter for directors such as Ermanno
Olmi, Francesco Rosi, and Vittorio De Seta, the disciples of neorealism who typified this
second phase.
Though the stylistic signatures of Visconti and Pasolini differed significantly from
each other – and in many instances from one film to the next – the films analyzed here
exemplify this second wave of neorealism insofar as the emigrant communities
marginalized by neocapitalism and scraping an existence on the fringes of the nation
constitute their subject matter. In addition, these directors’ different adaptation of
neorealist elements can be interpreted as a reevaluation of the role of cinema itself in the
transition to a new phase of capitalism.
81
 Partly addressing themselves to neorealism,
their films critically distanced themselves from the earlier cinematic tradition.
Neorealism’s mutation during the 1950s had served as a testament to the power of
capitalism to absorb even those cultural movements that had emerged in an antagonistic
stance to it. If cinema was to hold any capacity for social critique, it had to alter its
language and become less immediately incorporable by the dominant culture.
This renewed critical agenda also explains the thematic differences between the
first and second wave of neorealism. While continuing to cultivate an interest in the

downtrodden, generally speaking there was a move away from epic overviews and a
concern with subjects that were narrower, more private and interior, even psychological.
Visconti momentarily abandoned the history of the Risorgimento, which had already
been told countless times in the neorealist project to reconstruct the nation after the war,
while Pasolini never invoked myths of national foundation at all but focused instead on
the repercussions upon Italian society of the political and economic changes that had
been unfolding for a decade, even behind the scenes of the neorealist movement itself.
Though neither of the films examined here makes explicit reference to the contemporary
political-economic situation, both are profoundly political denunciations of the economic
miracle, depicting the moral failures of the Italian capitalist and political class of the
1950s and 1960s.
Inextricably tied to these directors’ denouncements was also the realization that
the cultural transformation attempted by neorealism had proved inadequate for enacting
structural transformation, much less a sweeping cultural change. By 1960, the resurgence
and re-entry in government of the Right brought all the inadequacies of neorealism to
create a truly anti-fascist culture into stark relief.
82
 As a matter of fact, this so-called post-
fascist era was dominated by disturbing residues of what Pasolini called “clerico-fascist”
power. The critique of neorealism therefore often provided an ideal arena within which to
discuss Italy’s cultural, political, and economic woes.
In his introduction to Fellini’sLe Notti di Cabiria, for which he was hired as
consultant on the Roman underworld, Pasolini articulated a critique of neorealism
precisely in such terms. Neorealism, Pasolini argued, had not generated a new way of
thinking at all, a much needed “reorganization of thought” and of Italian culture. Rather,
it had remained a topical, aesthetic phenomenon. For Pasolini, neorealism remained
strictly a superstructural movement, disconnected from the real political and economic
conditions of post-fascist/neocapitalist Italy. The “sudden withering of neorealism,” he
concluded, was “the necessary fate of an improvised, although necessary, superstructure:
it is the price for a lack of mature thought, of a complete reorganization of the culture.”
83
What was more, the first wave of neorealism could not have captured the transformations
that had occurred in Italian society by 1960. “Quella stagione è tramontata, e con essa la
loro visione del mondo,” he declared. “L’Italia, come il resto d’Europa, anzi più in fretta
che il resto d’Europa, si è lasciata alle spalle i tempi di carestia e di miseria del
dopoguerra. Non ha più corso quindi la denuncia della vita quotidiana, almeno nella
forma adottata inPaisà o nellaStrada.”
84
For his part, Visconti harshly criticized what he believed to be a perversion of
neorealism that had made “cozy compromises” at the cost of sacrificing incisive analyses
of the nation’s most pressing social problems.

Rocco e i suoi fratelli was his
contribution to the attempt to rehabilitate neorealism’s critical task.

Luchino Visconti’sRocco e i suoi fratelli  and the Gramscian Alliance
As one of the founders of cinematic neorealism, Luchino Visconti’s cinema had
often been at the center of controversies regarding the movement’s formal structure and
political intents.
86
 His predilection for telescopic historical analyses often ran counter to
neorealism’s tendency to provide “snapshots” of reality, while the content of many of his
films similarly sat askew of typical neorealist concerns. In fact, rather than focus on the
themes of war and Resistance, Visconti preferred the pressing socio-political issues of the
day, such as emigration, post-war Reconstruction, the “economic miracle,” and, of
course, that constant staple in the Italian political and cultural diet, the Southern
Question. Deeply influenced by Verga’s literary realism, to which he would add a
generous dose of Gramscian Marxism, Visconti’s interest in the South and its relationship
to Italian national formation constituted a fixture of his filmmaking well into the 1960s.
Visconti’s difference of subject matter within neorealism may also have depended
on his decision to work in cinema at a slightly different time period, in a sense both
anticipating and concluding neorealism’s golden age in the mid to late 1940s. His 1942
Ossessione, generally considered to be the prototype of neorealist film,
87
 preceded the
movement by several years, while his neorealist masterpiece,La terra trema, appeared as
late as 1948, a full year after Rossellini concluded the last of his war trilogy films,
Germania Anno Zero. Thus, with the exception ofGiorni di gloria (1945), a documentary
film on the liberation of Rome, Luchino Visconti did not make any neorealist films
during the heyday of the movement itself.
Controversies over Visconti’s films also concerned questions of style. Even in its
“purest” form, Visconti’s filmmaking had never fit easily within the neorealist school,
andLa terra trema, with which he officially entered the movement, was a prime
example. Bazin believed the perennial battle between art and reality had been won by the
latter in this film, which he considered so documentary-like as to risk boring its audience
to tears
88
. Undoubtedly, in some key aspects the film was ultra-realist: not only were the
actors all non-professionals, they were an actual family of fishermen living in Aci Trezza.
The dialogue, conducted entirely in the specific version of Sicilian dialect spoken in Aci
Trezza, was developed by the actors themselves after Visconti described the situations he
wanted to film. There was no melodrama and no music (not even Rossellini could resist
placing a tune in the most dramatic moments of his neorealist films). Most of the action
took place outdoors, and even shots filmed in interiors used natural lighting. And finally,
there was no intrusive editing, as the camera was allowed to pan slowly, almost
contemplatively, over key scenes.
On the other hand, in other respects Visconti could not resist making certain
stylistic choices that distracted viewers from the film’s realism, placing them at a remove

81
from the reality on the screen. By privileging certain shots over others, for instance,
Visconti made a stylistic move that seemed to refer self-consciously to his authorial
presence. Perhaps the most controversial of such moments was the scene of the Valastro
women on the storm-swept beach awaiting the return of their men from a fishing
expedition. “Visconti lingers on these images for longer than the narrative itself would
require,” Millicent Marcus has argued, “using seven different camera positions in a short
space of time to give visual interest and grandeur to such static figures of despair
[...].The effect of the camera work and the mise-en-scène is to abstract the women from
their concrete historical circumstances and to project them into a mythic sphere of
timeless, universal truths.”
89
 Visconti also undercut his own realism by insisting on the
particular use of dialect, which gave the film a lyrical quality at odds with its
documentary-like format. Such moments of “intense aesthetic self-consciousness” served
to point to Visconti’s authorial presence in a way that amounted to a “signatory code”
90
This tension between reality and art prompted film critic Guido Aristarco to defineLa
terra trema, paradoxically, as Visconti’s simultaneous embrace and abandonment of
neorealism
91
. WithSenso (1956), a highly stylized, operatic melodrama on Italian
unification, Visconti’s abandonment of neorealism – and, according to Aristarco, his
entry into “critical realism” – seemed complete.
In spite of his “misfit” position within neorealism, or perhaps because of it,
Luchino Visconti was the most likely candidate for makingRocco e i suoi fratelli, a neo-
neorealist film about internal migration during the economic boom: he had been a
founder of cinematic neorealism, his most important films in these decades examined the
Southern Question and the deeply rooted divide between North and South in nat ional
unification (Laterratrema,Senso,Il gattopardo), and he had already examined, albeit in
limited form, the effects of emigration on the southern population inLa terra trema.
Visconti in fact once claimed thatRocco e i suoi fratelli constituted a sort of “sequel” to
La terra trema, with the Parondi family standing for the historical evolution of the
Valastros.
92
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Visconti had often made use of the family as a
locus of social conflicts, positing family relationships at the intersection of the economic
and cultural conflicts investing the nation and dramatizing the internal and external forces
threatening its survival. As inLa terra trema, the family inRocco e i suoi fratelli is
initially represented as close and supportive, only to shatter at the end under the pressure
of tradition on the one hand and changing cultural and economic conditions on the
other.
93
 Set in Milan,Rocco e i suoi fratelli narrates the story of a mother and her five
sons, the Parondi family, who have just arrived from Basilicata. The film is broken down
into five episodes, each named after one of the Parondi brothers – Vincenzo, Simone,
Rocco, Ciro, Luca – and follows the family’s gradual disintegration until final tragedy
erupts when they cannot adapt to their new conditions of life in the North.

82
Aside from its focus on the tribulations of a poor southern family,Rocco e i suoi
fratelli also bore a stylistic resemblance toLa terra trema. After the opulence and color
saturation ofSenso,Rocco’s stark, black and white cinematography, extreme close-ups
and on-location shooting, especially in Milan’s squalid periphery and dehumanized
Seadrome, are a polemic reinstatement of neorealism’s task to reveal the inequalities and
alienation of the economic miracle. The result was a film that, at the height of the
economic miracle, pushed the Southern Question to the forefront of national concerns
once again, demonstrating how utter separateness between North and South “persist[ed]
in a very disturbing manner,” as mass internal migration made far too obvious.
94
 By
examining the phenomenon of southern migration,Rocco e i suoi fratelli focused on the
most visible aspect of the miracle.
WithRocco, Visconti painted a portrait of the economic miracle absent from the
self-congratulatory accounts of officialdom of “a South and a Sicily and a Sardinia
transformed by the presence of a greater number of paved roads, of factories, of land re-
distribution, of administrative autonomy”; what Visconti wanted was
to listen to the more profound voice coming from the reality of the South: that is
to say of a humanity and a civilization that, though not having received but the
crumbs of this great little party of the so-called Italian economic miracle, still
hopes to escape from the moral and spiritual isolation of the all-Italian prejudice
that keeps the South in conditions of inferiority compared to the rest of the
nation.
95
More than providing a melodramatic portrayal of southern migration, therefore, the film
called for a critical reflection of Italy’s economic boom and its inherent injustices. Most
importantly, however,Rocco e i suoi fratelli did not stop at denouncing the historical
denial of national unity but suggested emigration might be the last occasion for national
unity to be achieved in the form of that alliance Gramsci had once urged between
northern proletariat and southern peasantry.
This underlying nationalist aspiration, intended in the Gramscian “national-
popular” sense, drives the plot of the film and renders it essentially a critique of
familism, for Visconti uses the Parondi family to advance a critique that is social:
Visconti attacks this family’s moral basis because he believes its unity and cohesion to be
the basis of southern society. The film is therefore an attack of familism, demonstrating
the obstacles it places upon the emancipation of the subaltern and, after Gramsci, upon
the realization of a national-popular hegemony.
Visconti represents the Parondis’ amoral familism through both narrative and
formal devices. Beginning with the opening of the film, Visconti chose to focus directly
upon the Parondis’ arrival in Milan, rather than depict their dramatic departure and
northward journey. In this manner, he is able to recreate for the audience the same
“traumatic” impact between modern city and backward peasantry. For Visconti, the
Parondis’ journey is irrelevant because, as we shall see, the point of arrival – the modern,
industrial city - constituted the point of departure for a new Italian nation. The family’s
isolation is immediately conveyed through Visconti’s framing of space. The wide angle
shot of Milan’s train station highlights the loneliness of the Parondi family. Having
arrived late at night, with no one to await them, they momentarily huddle together against
94
 Luchino Visconti, “DaOssessione aRocco.” in Callegari and Lodato,Leggere Visconti, 76.
95

83
the strangeness and the cold in the vast and empty station. Their appearance further sets
them apart from their modern surroundings; their ragged clothes and makeshift luggage
contrasting with the industrial steel and glass structure of the station. As they traverse the
city by tram, the Parondis resemble time travelers peering out of a capsule, awestruck by
the subversion of traditional cycles of time as city lights turn night into day: “Rocco,
guarda! Guarda che vetrine, che luce!” Simone exclaims, laughing, “Sembra giorno!”
The temporal disjunction is reinforced in the following scene, when the family
arrives to disrupt the engagement party of Vincenzo, the eldest Parondi brother already
living in Milan, and his girlfriend, Gina (played by Claudia Cardinale). From the
conversation and the speech pattern of Gina and her parents, we gather that they also
emigrated from the South, but have had greater time to adjust culturally and to improve
their economic circumstances. Though not rich, the family is quite obviously
comfortable. As the camera slides unobtrusively between party streamers and guests, it
picks up evidence of expendable income: The house is large and well heated, decorated
for the occasion, filled with party food, liquor, and youngsters sipping cocktails around a
radio playing modern music. Snatches of conversation complete the picture of abundance
as someone admits that they always end up eating too much at these parties and another
comments on young people’s obsession with going to the cinema. An exchange between
Vincenzo, Gina and her brother indicates the young couple is willing to make sacrifices
to move out and make it on their own once they are married. The Parondis’ sudden
arrival on this scene sets up a dramatic contrast that stresses their archaism and complete
otherness with respect to the modern world. The Parondi brothers’ near mute discomfort,
excessive shyness and voracious hunger are evidence of their primitivism and scarce
domesticit y wit h modern leisure settings.
But this scene is important also because it establishes the power of familism. The
Parondis’ sudden arrival complicates Vincenzo’s plans to marry and start a new life with
Gina. Mamma Parondi’s sharp features, black mourning clothes and cape giving her the
appearance of a vulture, she tyrannizes Vincenzo into taking on his responsibilities over
them first, concluding in front of Gina’s vexed family that “he’s the one who has to think
of all of us now.” Because taking care of the Parondis will incapacitate Vincenzo from
starting a new life with Gina, he is no longer deemed suitable for her and hence no longer
welcome in her parents’ home. In this scene Visconti manages effectively to put the
familist model in relief by contrasting the positive desire of young people to break away
from their families to start new families of their own with the negative custom of
remaining within, and shouldering the burden of, the extended family. It is natural to
break away from the older generation, while allowing the old-fashioned customs and
beliefs to dominate is discordant with the values of a modern nation and hinders its
development just as it hinders Vincenzo’s and Gina’s future plans.
The archaic values of familism are also shown to affect other aspects of modern
life, such as gender relations. Vincenzo’s own regression with respect to his relationship
with Gina is apparent immediately after he reunites with his family. In his first encounter
with her after he is thrown out of her parents’ house, he suggests that forcing himself on
her might provide a solution to their contested relationship: “Do you know what Mother
says? She says that if a man wants to take his woman he just takes her.” Gina slaps him
and counters that he should always ask for her permission. With this gesture, it is the

84
more integrated Gina who reasserts the cultural values of the modern society they wish to
be a part of.
Another manner in which Visconti contrasts the emigrants’ familism with the
modern nation is by portraying them as possessed by excessive, violent passions. Of all
the brothers, it is Simone (played by Renato Salvatori), the second oldest, who
personifies powerful, destructive emotions, and a thirst for vengeance that presumably
characterized southerners. Having fallen in love with Nadia (played by Annie Girardot), a
prostitute, Simone demands to be her only man, exploding into a jealous rage that will set
off the family’s dissolution when he learns that she and his younger brother Rocco have
fallen in love, even though he and Nadia had stopped seeing each other months earlier. In
the character of Simone, Visconti invests all those qualities that he takes to be the
“sentimenti atavici della gente del Sud, i tabù. Il sentimento dell’onore, della famiglia,
della donna che appartiene a uno e soltanto a lui.”
96
 Simo ne’s vio lent emotions and
primitive values will lead him first to rape Nadia and then eventually to kill her.
But Visconti also makes it clear that the family’s downfall is as much the fault of
younger Rocco as it is of Simone. A “pure” and kind-hearted character, Rocco (played by
Alain Delon) boxes for a living but is saddened by the hatred and violence required by his
profession. Visconti once characterized Rocco as an “unarmed prophet” because though
he possessed great insight into the tragedy befalling his family, he lacked the
consciousness required to halt  its downward spiral.
97
Rocco’s passive destructiveness is closely related to the predominance of the
“clan.” In addition to his own personal suffering, he also takes on the unhappiness of his
entire family. It ishis purity of heart andhis nostalgia for his southern village that do not
allow his family to overcome its backwardness; in order to transcend their condition, the
Parondis must take on modern social values. Yet Rocco consistently resists this
adaptation, and repeatedly resorts to the fantasy of returning home to “Lucania” (not
“Basilicata”) some day. After his first great boxing victory, Rocco delivers a speech to
his assembled family, vowing “the day will come that I will return home. And if this were
to not be possible for me, perhaps one of you will be able to return to our land.” The
camera cuts from Rocco to the skeptical faces of his mother and brothers. None of them
remembers why, in Lucanian tradition, the home builder throws the first stone in the
shadow of the first person to pass by. “Because,” Rocco reminds them, “it takes sacrifice
for the home to turn out solid.” Indeed, Rocco has sacrificed everything, including Nadia,
to keep his family solid, its unity uncompromised by outside forces. This point is also
reinforced through parallel editing, as scenes of Rocco’s boxing match are intercut with
those of Simone’s murder of Nadia. As Rocco’s coach shouts “cover yourself,” Simone
says the same to Nadia before he kills her. Nadia’s role as sacrificial lamb for the Parondi
family is further illustrated by her pose as Simone advances to stab her: leaning her back
up against a tree with her arms outstretched, she mimics a crucifixion.
Rocco’s excessive devotion to his family is thus just as responsible for Nadia’s
death as Simone’s depravity. Rocco shoulders like a personal guilt all of Simone’s sins
because he failed to put his brother, and thus his family, first, even in his love affair with

he evidently believed to be an “unarmed prophet.”

Nadia. Visconti once commented, “Questo mi sembrava di averlo intuito abbastanza in
quelle che sono le caratteristiche proprie dei personaggi meridionali. Rocco prova un
sentimento di colpa verso il fratello. Non bisogna mai dimenticare questo, che lui crede
ed è convinto di essere in torto. Rocco non attribuisce nessuna colpa a Simone, ma tutto a
se stesso. E lo dice anche a Nadia: ‘Tutti e due siamo colpevoli, ma io più di te. Io più di
te in quanto tu sei la donna di mio fratello.’”
98
  When, months before murdering her,
Simone rapes Nadia, Rocco remains a helpless witnesses, and afterwards he does not
respond to Simone’s punches even though he boxes for a living. “Sei mio fratello, che
posso fare?” he shouts. Rocco then places the burden of what has happened on his own
and Nadia’s shoulders, ending their relationship and urging her to return to Simone.
“Ammo creduto de cumincià ’nsieme ’na nuova vita,” he says, defeated, “senza pensà ’o
male che facevamo agli altri.” Unlike Vincenzo and Gina, who wish to break away from
the family, Rocco remains unwaveringly anchored to it.
However, it is between Rocco and Ciro that Visconti sets up the greatest contrast.
Later on in the film, Ciro confronts Rocco over what to do about Simone’s criminal
tendencies. Though Ciro does not know about Simone’s rape of Nadia, he is no longer
willing to turn the other cheek to the criminal lifestyle that Simone conducts in their
family home. “Fratello o no, per me non conta più. [...] Noi siamo come semi di uno
stesso sacco,” he concludes, “Se tra noi ce n’è uno guastato, lo dobbiamo separare dagli
altri.” But Rocco defends Simone and ultimately concludes that “this was our destiny.
Yours, mine, and Simone’s, too.” When Ciro asks him what life he thinks they would
have had if they had stayed in Basilicata, Rocco’s automatic reply is that at least they
would all still be together.  From then on, Rocco lives to shoulder the guilt of his
brother’s actions, remaining in the boxing world even though he loathes it so that he may
cover Simone’s debts and keep pulling him out of trouble. Ciro, on the other hand, pays
Simone to leave their house forever, as he is only a negative model to the youngest
brother, little Luca.
Again and again Visconti illustrates how Rocco’s self-sacrifice does not save his
family but, on the contrary, seals its doom. After Simone murders Nadia, he returns home
to his family and confesses to Rocco what he has done. Though horrified, Rocco does not
condemn his brother but cries that it is his own fault. His sharing of Simone’s sin is
visually reinforced as Rocco embraces his brother on their mother’s bed during Simone’s
confession. When the rest of the family learns what Simone has done, Ciro is the only
one to suggest turning him in to the police. Rocco, on the other hand, claims he must do
everything to save him. When Mother Parondi exclaims that Simone has finally freed
himself of his misfortune (i.e. Nadia), Ciro replies aghast, “Mother, you too have lost
your mind!” His mother slaps him and turns ferociously against him: “Shame on you!
Enemy of your own mother!” Ciro manages barely to escape from the clutches of his
family and to report Simone to the police.
Visconti’s insistent message is that Rocco’s uncondit ional so lidarit y and devotion
to family unity above all other concerns is, ironically, what causes its disintegration. If
the family had acquired greater flexibility, adjusting its values to those of its northern
environment, it might have survived intact. What ultimately destroys the Parondi family’s
harmony is its inability to abandon its familism in accordance with the requirements of a
modern nation. The family is dysfunctional insofar as it fails to adapt to social life in the
98

86
modern North, which entails subtending to institutions of civil society, such as a legal
system that forbids “delitti d’onore.” Family harmony and solidarity are comprehensible
and even necessary in the first stages of emigration, but the tribal notions of “honor” and
masculine pride must then give way to the state in regulating interpersonal relations
within the private sphere.
The only one to accomplish this change, at first gradually then in a final act of
courage as he turns against his own family, is Ciro. Having acquired a proletarian identity
through his work in the factory, Ciro is the only character capable of identifying and
criticizing the fatal flaw of amoral familism in his family, especially with regards to
Rocco. In discussing Ciro’s character, Visconti once declared
Volevo un Ciro forse un po’ duro, forse un pochino anche crudele verso la sorte del
fratello caduto [...] è giusto che sia così, perché Ciro difende certi valori, piano
piano acquista una coscienza: se la fa vivendo a Milano, e diventando operaio
specializzato, in una fabbrica come l’Alfa Romeo; lui certe cose le vede in un modo
diverso dai fratelli, non può non essere un po’ duro.’ [...] Ciro ha detto: questa è
una strada giusta; ed è l’unico che in fondo impari qualcosa.
99
Turning his brother Simone in to the police is the ultimate proof that Ciro has acquired
faith in and respect for the institutions of the modern state and has learned he must work
within these instead of within the narrow confines of the clan. His gesture, which brings
his family’s destruction to completion, simultaneously signals his own rebirth as Italian.
We are afforded a glimpse of this new subject in the film’s final scene, where
Ciro imparts a life lesson to little Luca. To illustrate the futility of fantasizing a return to
their hometown, where “everyone lives like a beast, knowing only toil and obedience,” he
explains that in the North everyone lives without being someone else’s servant. In his
romanticization of Lucania, Rocco had forgotten this. Yet Ciro holds hope that his
actions, within the society he has entered, will eventually change the face of all of Italy:
“Even in our town life will change for everyone, because even down there men are
learning that the world must change. Some say that a world thus made will not be better.
But I believe in it. And I know that tomorrow your life will be more just and more
honest.”
By illustrating Ciro’s development in the face of his family’s amoral familism,
Visconti provided Italian spectators with the clearest illustration of what the Gramscian
alliance between North and South might have looked like. Though the film opens onto
the abyss between two Italies separated by economic disparity, cultural values and
language, it closes on a possible outcome to this traumatic encounter, the occasion to
form a truly national-popular unification such as Italy had never experienced.
However, Visconti’s logic is also problematic, in that thepresa di coscienza, the
revolutionary mentality Ciro acquires, is the result of his having become a factory
worker, suggesting that the Southern Question may only be overcome with the death of
the peasant class through its absorption into northern industrial society, which is to say
that Italy’s national becoming is only fulfilled with the disappearance of the peasant
class.
100
 Ciro’s proletarian vision, therefore, also left millions of Southern peasants as
ideologically “unarmed” as the tragically self-sacrificing Rocco.

 It is interesting to note, however, that Visconti’s conclusion echoes the more party- and
proletarian- oriented interpretation of Gramsci (i.e. Togliatti’s Gramsci) then in circulation in Italy, before

87
Pier Paolo Pasolini’sAccattone and the Genocide of the Subproletariat
The destruction of the peasant world under the advance of neocapitalism was
precisely the accusation Pier Paolo Pasolini leveled against the devotees of Italy’s
economic miracle. A poet, novelist, filmmaker and intellectual, Pasolini became known
as much for his works as for the attempts of state and Church to censor them, dragging
him through close to one hundred trials and lawsuits in his lifetime.
101
 Like Visconti, he
too had been greatly influenced by Gramsci, but Pasolini’s approach to Gramsci’s
philosophy became conflicted early on in his life and works. In the poem titledGramsci’s
Ashes, Pasolini confessed to being disquieted by a “scandal of the conscience,”
Lo scandalo del contraddirmi, dell’essere
con te e contro te; con te nel cuore;
in luce, contro te nelle buie viscere
102
In essence, Pasolini found Gramsci’s notion of national-popular no longer tenable for an
Italy in the grips of neocapitalist culture, the analysis of which Pasolini would make his
life’s work. His vision of neocapitalism’s homogenizing power and violence eventually
assumed apocalyptic overtones, culminating in the final year of his life in his nightmarish
cinematic masterpiece,Salò (1975).
103
 ButSalò was only the finale of Pasolini’s lifelong
denunciation of the fascist character of mass-consumer culture, especially in Italy, where
the forces of Church and Fascism had managed to remain in power after the Resistance.
Pasolini’s correlation of the neocapitalist culture industry with Fascism resonated with
the work of Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer of the Frankfurt School. For these
critical theorists, late capitalism’s ability to colonize culture allowed capitalism
unprecedented, totalizing power, until “anyone who resists can survive only by being
incorporated” into a closed system where “theFührer directly orders both the holocaust
and the supply of trash.”
104
But Pasolini’s critique of neocapitalism was also at the root of his conflicted
rapport with neorealism. In his view, neorealism’s denunciation of Italy’s material
poverty no longer held currency in a country where increased wealth and consumption
was tragically liquidating the cultural sovereignty and spiritual authenticity of the non-
bourgeois population. The task of a politically engaged cinematography was to give the
besieged subproletariat a chance to express itself, rather than simply miming it through
speech and clothing, as neorealism had done. The real protagonist of neorealist films,
Pasolini argued, had been the bourgeois ideology calling for material progress. Pasolini’s
Einaudi’s subsequent (1975) and less invasive edition of theQuaderni del Carcere was to restore
Gramsci’s complexity of thought to thePrison Notebooks.
101
 Enzo Siciliano’sVita di Pasolini (Milano: Mondadori, 2005) remains the most comprehensive
biography on Pasolini. For an account of Pasolini’s perspective on neocapitalism, see Giulio Sapelli,
Modernizzazione senza sviluppo. Il capitalismo secondo Pasolini (Milano: Mondadori, 2005).And for an
ample review of Pasolini’s entire oeuvre, refer to Guido Santato,Pier Paolo Pasolini. L’opera (Vicenza:

 Various scholars have interpretedSalò according to the theme of “sex as a metaphor of power.”
While this is an important element of the film, I agree with Naomi Greene’ s reading of it as Pasolini’s
vision of the fascist essence of neocapitalism and as his ultimate refusal to consume. See Naomi Greene,
“Salò: The Refusal to Consume,” inPier Paolo Pasolini: Contemporary Perspectives, ed. Patrick Rumble
(Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1994), 236.

first film,Accattone (1961), which he once defined as “a film that could be made in Italy
in a specific cultural moment; that is to say when neorealism was dead,” was his response
to the shortcomings of neorealism.
105
Given Pasolini’s merciless critique of neocapitalism and the failure of neorealism
to adequately interpret its destructive force, it is not surprising that he should have found
Visconti’s portrayal of southern emigrants inRocco e i suoi fratelli lacking. The
characters were “dei meridionali di maniera,” he claimed, and their poverty too
picturesque. Admittedly, though the film was set in Milan, the Coree never make an
appearance in Visconti’s film. What was required, Pasolini countered, was to analyze the
problem “con la più coraggiosa e spietata intenzio ne di appro fondirlo e esprimerlo”
106
If Visconti saw internal migration, however tragic, as a possibility for carrying out
a Gramscian national-popular alliance, Pasolini harbored no such illusions. A national-
popular alliance was unthinkable insofar as he interpreted Gramsci’s concept of
“hegemony” in an entirely negative light, seeing it only as an instrument of capitalist
oppression and not as also a means of subaltern resistance. We might say that, to the
extent that Pasolini could be considered a Marxist thinker, the advent of consumerism
and the disappearance of cultures impervious to it eventually eroded his propensity for
dialectical thinking. His keen power of observation and his personal experience as a
declared homosexual in a country still dominated by “clerico-fascism” keyed him in to
modernity’s strategies for liquidating difference quite early in his life. He observed how,
on the one hand, modernity’s centrifugal force tended to absorb and integrate the
dangerous classes through the cooptive dynamic of the new consumerism; on the other, it
continued to reject them in centripetal fashion, marginalizing them economically,
politically, and geographically – even to the point of denying them basic rights of
citizenship with laws intended specifically to exclude them, as we have seen with the
anti-urbanization law.
107
 The hegemony that resulted was a process of co-optation that
Pasolini first defined as “cultural homologation” and then, once he believed this process
to have become anthropological, as downright cultural genocide.
108
Elsewhere in Europe, Pasolini argued, the peasantry had had centuries to become
accustomed to the capitalist world view, to negotiate or contest its rhythms and values,
but in Italy the peasant masses coming into contact with the urban middle and working
classes had to shed their own way of life literally overnight, without seeing them replaced
by a new system of values or receiving any of the social and political benefits that the
capitalist revolution had produced elsewhere. Hence Pasolini’s belief in the genocidal
effects of the economic miracle upon Italy’s pre-industrial civilization.

 In 1979 Giuseppe Galasso concurred with this negative reading of hegemony with respect to
the southern population when he claimed that “l’evoluzione storica del Mezzogiorno in questi due o tre
decenni è stata caratterizzata, da un lato, da un aggravamento dei suoi problemi strutturali, dei problemi di
congruenza e di consistenza della struttura economica meridionale rispetto a quella nazionale; e, dall’altro
lato, invece, da una rapida assimilazione, nel costume e nella mentalità sociale, almeno della maggior parte
delle zone meridionali, al resto del paese.” See Gerardo Chiaromonte and Giuseppe Galasso,L’Italia
dimezzata (Bari: Laterza, 1980), 22.

89
Reflecting on the relationship between the core and periphery of Rome, which
he’d made his home since 1950, Pasolini lamented the disappearance of subproletarian
cultures, which until then had been sovereign and autonomous:
La loro “cultura”, tanto profondamente diversa da creare una “razza”, forniva ai
sottoproletari romani una morale e una filosofia da classe “dominata”, che la
classe “dominante” si accontentava di “dominare” poliziescamente, senza curarsi
di evangelizzarla, cioè di costringerla ad assorbire la propria ideologia [...]
Lasciata per secoli a se stessa, cioè alla propria immobilità, quella cultura aveva
elaborato valori e modelli di co mportamento assoluti. Niente poteva metterli in
discussione. Come in tutte le culture popolari, i “figli” ricreavano i “padri” [...]
Mai nessuna rivoluzione interna a quella cultura, dunque. La tradizione era la vita
stessa.
109
In his efforts to isolate a counterpart to capitalist society, one that by virtue of its
complete otherness and centuries-lo ng exclusio n from national format ion had remained
unsullied by the cultural logic of capitalism, Pasolini constructed the southern
subproletariat as an immobile, archaic civilization. Of course, the very process of
excluding the Other is inherent in the formation of the nation itself, just as the South’s
very “ruralism” had been the intrinsic counterpart to the nation’s pursuit of industrial
capitalism.
110
 However, what is important here is that for Pasolini the subproletarian class
did not constitute a revolutionary subject as much as a critical remnant, if only by virtue
of the fact that, for a while longer at least, it had managed simply to resist the genocide.
It is chiefly through explorations of space, especially as it developed around the
nation’s capital, that Pasolini represented the life and death struggle between the nation
and its archaic Other. In both his literary and filmic works, Pasolini paid a great deal of
attention to the refashioning of urban space under neocapitalism. In synecdochal
relationship with the rest of the nation, the capital city becomes in Pasolini’s work the
center of sweeping social-structural changes, representing spatially the uneven
developments unfolding in the nation as a whole. Where Visconti had portrayed the
temporal conflict between peasant world and industrial capitalism by inscribing upon the
family the conflicts occurring at the margins of the industrial city, Pasolini maps out the
miracle’s process of national redefinition onto Rome’s urbanspace, representing the
battle between the nation and its Others through the encroachment of new public housing
projects upon the older slums lying along the city’s outskirts.
This spatial exploration appears as early as 1955, in Pasolini’s first novel,Ragazzi
di vita, set in the periphery Rome. Here, the brutalization of human interaction is
continually echoed in the ravaged, trashy landscape in which the poor live and move,
where new construction is old and devastated before it is even finished, much like the
lives of its young inhabitants:
Da Monteverde Vecchio ai Granatieri la strada è corta: basta passare il Prato, e
tagliare tra le palazzine in costruzione intorno al viale dei Quattro Venti: valanghe
109
 Pasolini, “il mioAccattone,” 153-54.
110
 Pasolini did, however, demonstrate he was aware of the see-saw mechanism of Italian capitalist
“development,” when he claimed in one interview, “Tu sai benissimo che il vostro ‘benessere’ [...] implica
il ‘malessere’: ossia il neocapitalismo rende più profonda la divisione tra Nord e Sud, man mano che il
Nord si arricchisce, il Sud – in senso relative e assoluto – impoverisce.” See Pier Paolo Pasolini, “Intervista
rilasciata ad Alberto Arbasino,” inSaggi, 1571.

d’immondezza, case non ancora finite e già in rovina, grandi sterri fangosi,
scarpate piene di zozzeria.
111
In a series of articles published inVie Nuove in 1958, the first of which is significantly
titled “Il fronte della città” Pasolini literally redirects his readers’ gaze from the
monuments of Rome to this battle front on the city’s horizon:
La Roma ignota al turista, ignorata dal benpensante, inesistente sulle piante, è una
città immensa [...] di qua e di là frammenti di villaggi di tuguri, distese di casette
da città beduina, frane sgangherate di palazzoni e cinema sfarzosi, ex casali
incastrati tra grattacieli, dighe di pareti altissime e vicoletti fangosi, vuoti
improvvisi in cui ricompaiono sterri e prati con qualche gregge sparso intorno, e,
in fondo – nella campagna bruciata o fangosa, tutta collinette, montarozzi,
affossamenti, vecchie cave, altipiani, fogne, ruderi, scarichi, marane e
immondezzai – il fronte della città.
112
In the successive article, titled “I tuguri,” Pasolini focuses on the specific relationship
between this mass of “pre-modern” population and the nation. Thetuguri (“shacks”) are
“abitazioni tipiche di popoli a uno stadio preistorico,” and exist as an “irrational state”
within the rational nation-state.
113
 At this point in Italian history and in Pasolini’s work,
these communities can still represent a threat to the nation insofar as they remain utterly
Other, “irreducible.” Inhabited mostly by emigrants who’d come from the South, these
formed a sort of “pure subproletariat.”
 114
Because this “irreducible” anarchic mass threatened the order the nation attempted
to achieve, it had to be brought under the state’s control, which occurs through the state’s
conquest of space. This was the function of the new public housing blocs that Pasolini
called concentration camps. In the last article of the series, titled “I campi di
concentramento,” Pasolini explained that these had been devised to house the unwanted
elements living at the margins of society, as a way to continue to keep them in their
place, out of the city proper:
Ogni città italiana, anche nel Nord, ha, alla periferia, dietro gli ultimi orti, i suoi
piccoli campi di concentramento per “miserabili”: sono per lo più capannoni,
casermette, baracche. Ma in nessuna città  italiana il fatto presenta aspetti così
impressionanti, complessi, direi grandiosi, come a Roma. La “borgata” è un
fenomeno tipicamente romano, in quanto Roma fu capitale dello Stato fascista. È
vero, continuano a sorgere anche oggi delle “borgate”. Ma, per così dire, sono
borgate “libere”: ammassi di casette a uno o due piani, senza tetto, per anni e anni
senza infissi, e senza intonaco, biancheggianti di calce in fondo alle campagne
semi-abbandonate – lussureggianti o fangose – come villaggi beduini. Le strade
sono per lo più piste di fango o polverone [...]
          Le vere e proprie borgate, però, sono altre, e sono caratterizzate dal fatto di
essere “ufficiali”: costruite cioè dal Comune, si direbbe a bella posta, per

115
To the subproletariat’s anarchic slums, the state responded with borgate in which to
concentrate the marginalized population:
Le prime “borgate” furono costruite dai fascist i in seguito agli sventrament i:
sventramenti che non obbedivano solo a un ideale estetizzante-dannunziano,
evidentemente: ma erano – in seconda istanza, ma in realtà, in sostanza –
operazioni di polizia. Forti contingenti di sottoproletariato romano, formicolante
al centro, negli antichi quartierisventrati, furono deportati in mezzo alla
campagna, in quartieri isolati, costruiti non a caso come caserme o prigioni.
È nato in quel periodo lo “stile” della borgata: il fondo, naturalmente, è di
tipo classicheggiante e imperiale: ma ciò che è tipico è il ripetersi ossessivo di
uno stesso motivo architettonico: una stessa casa è ripetuta in fila cinque, dieci,
venti volte: lo stesso gruppo di case si ripete anch’esso cinque, dieci, venti volte
uguale. I cortili interni sono tutti identici: lividi, arsi cortiletti di prigioni, con file
di sostegni di cemento per i bucati che sembrano file di forche, col lavatoio e col
gabinetto che serve all’intero lotto.
116
For Pasolini the Christian Democratic government’s attempts to bring under its control
this dangerous class were no more humane than those of the Fascist regime that had
preceded it. That the Republic shared with the Fascist dictatorship the same fear of the
poor and the same authoritarian relationship was further evidence of the continuity that
existed between the two regimes:
Le “borgate” democristiane sono identiche a quelle fasciste, perché è identico il
rapporto che si istituisce tra Stato e “poveri”: rapporto autoritario e paternalistico,
profondamente inumano nella sua mistificazione religiosa.
117
It was precisely in relation to the imagery of this “front” encircling the city, and his urge
to represent it visually, that Pasolini first began to think about making a film:
Pare non esserci altro mezzo di conoscenza che l’occhio. Lo spettacolo visivo è
così assillante, grandioso, senza soluzione di continuità, che pare di poter
risolvere tutto, intuitivamente, in una serie ininterrotta di osservazioni: di
inquadrature, verrebbe voglia di dire, da una infinità di primi piani
particolarissimi, a un’infinità di panoramiche sconfinate.
118
Two years later, Pasolini filmedAccattone, in which he used both narrative and stylistic
devices to convey the space where the subproletariat and the nation clash, the “front”
made up of pre-modern shanty-towns and borgate. The protagonist (played by Franco
Citti, whose brother, Sergio Citti, assisted Pasolini with the film’s dialogue) is a pimp
who proudly calls himself Accattone (Beggar, Scrounger) rather than with his given
name, Vittorio (“Victory”). The title of the film and its protagonist’s name allow Pasolini
to convey the marginality of his subject with great economy, immediately describing a
character who does not earn a living by working but rather by scrounging, scraping off a
marginal existence.

92
Though Pasolini incorporates neorealist elements, such as the emphasis on the
poor, the use of non-professional actors and vernacular language, on-location shooting
and a gritty visual texture, he also reached outside of the neorealist aesthetic in order to
express the residuality of this culture, resorting to pre-modern religious imagery and
Baroque music that invested his characters with a sacred essence. In the opening of the
film, Accattone accepts a bet by diving into the Tiber River off of Ponte Sant’Angelo, the
bridge that connects Castel Sant’Angelo to the historic center of the city. As Accattone
dives down, his body forms an inverted crucifix while on the bridge above him one of
Bernini’s angel sculptures holds an upright cross. Accattone also assumes the pose of
crucifixion in the moment of his death, as one of the two thieves standing on either side
of him makes the sign of an inverted cross. The film’s musical score consists entirely of
Bach’sThe Passion of St. Matthew (1727) which sets to music chapters 26 and 27 of the
Gospel of St.Matthew – that is, the life of Jesus from trial to crucifixion (significantly
leaving out the Resurrection). This use of sacred music and imagery serves to re-sacralize
the true martyrs on theVia Crucis of neocapitalism, and anticipate the lyrical quality of
Pasolini’s filmmaking that he would later call his “cinema of poetry.”
When the prostitute Accattone pimps out (significantly named Maddalena) suffers
a beating from a group of thugs and is put in jail, Accattone is unable to support himself,
and eventually steals his own son’s gold necklace to survive. In a drunken speech,
Accattone bewails his predicament to another group of pimps, but his lament is really an
outcry of the subproletariat’s marginal relationship to capitalist economy: “Semo tutti na
massa de disgraziati, semo omini finiti, ce scartano tutti! Noi valemo giusto se ciavemo
mille lire in saccoccia, se no nun semo niente... Pure in galera nun ce ponno vedé, a noi.
Nun ce considerano omini perché nun semo boni a provacce da soli!”
Accattone’s prospects seem to improve when he falls in love with a working girl,
Stella, and they move in together. After her first nightmarish experience hooking, he
decides to support her by finding a regular job. However, his attempt to insert himself
and Stella within the dominant economic system, symbolized by his transition from the
marginal economy of prostitution to the center of industrial production, ends tragically.
Accattone is physically incapable of performing the hard labor required of him, at one
point referring to a concentration camp: “Ma che stamo a Buchenwald, qua?” This is not
the only time or manner in which Accattone rebells against “honest work.” When he first
meets Stella, observing her cleaning bottles to be recycled, he says, “Lo saprebbe io che
ce vo’ in Italia [...] Lincoln l’ha fatti liberà li schiavi. E invece in Italia ce l’anno messi!
Con un mitra in mano a me, ne rimanessimo in pochi in piedi.” This is a far cry from the
proletarian consciousness Ciro’s character acquires in Visconti’s film. Perhaps like
Pasolini, Accattone refuses to idolize the new form of slavery of industrial labor, but
ultimately this spells his death. When he is pushed to the margins again by the dominant
economy, he decides to become a thief. Accattone meets his death as he attempts to
escape the police, racing away from the city center on a stolen motorcycle.
The film’s ending – a pointed reference to the neorealist masterpieceLadri di
Biciclette – radicalizes Pasolini’s social critique by demonstrating the genocidal logic of
the new economic order. WatchingLadri di Biciclette, we never know who steals
Antonio Ricci’s bicycle, but we imagine it is someone similarly desperate for survival in
the new economic jungle. WithAccattone, Pasolini shows us the face, so to speak, of that
figure neorealism had hidden from us, the bicycle thief: worse off than Antonio Ricci

93
because he is pushed systematically, not just by historical contingency, to the margins of
existence, Accattone loses not just his economic stability but his very life.
In a 1975 article inIl Corriere della Sera tit led “I l mioAccattone in TV dopo il
genocidio,” Pasolini claimed the film rendered perfectly the continuity between the
Fascist and Christian Democratic regimes in two ways: first, by depicting the
ghettoization and increasing marginalizaion of the subproletariat; and second, by
demonstrating the criminal violence of the police in maintaining this physical and social
segregation.
The manner in which Pasolini conveys both points is through his framing of space
as he moves between the borgate and the older slums in the Roman periphery. In order to
narrate the disappearance of the subproletariat, Pasolini sets up visual parallels to the
film’s narrative. Through the use of wide-angle shots, his camera pans across the hills on
the outskirts of Rome in a way that sets up a quasi-bucolic foreground where primordial
forms of life are being literally strangled by the encroaching cement structures of the
borgate. When Accattone goes in search of his estranged wife, hoping she will spare him
some change, he crosses small, dirty plots of land interspersed with run-down shacks and
so filled with rubbish they are one step away from becoming open-air landfills, where
women, including his wife, work discarding recycling material. Pasolini slowly pans
across this landscape, stopping only when the new borgate appear on the horizon.
Pasolini also employs vertical panning to underscore the closing in of the new
slums. At one point in the film, as Accattone and his friends stand talking on a street, the
camera pans from the top of a highrise, down its length to the street where the young men
are talking, across the street, and up the side of another highrise all the way to its top in
one long take.
Later on in the film, when Accattone goes to steal his son’s necklace, he meets a
friend and talks to him about the role of the police to keep the poor in line: “So’ finiti i
tempi bellici. Oggi come metti un piede fori de casa te carcerano. Ma non lo vedi che sta
a fa’ el questore?” Accattone’s words are reinforced by the mis-en-scene: on one side of
him we see a ruined, abandoned hut on whose walls someone has painted the words
“Vogliamo una casa civile;” on the other, the new highrises of the borgate mushroom
along the horizon, giving visual weight to Accattone’s accusations.
But the clearest impression we get of the borgate’s ubiquity is when Accattone
tries to take Stella to a “secluded” spot to seduce her. After walking through mounds of
debris and making their way through construction sites, they reach a grassy expanse. As
the camera follows them, it makes a liesurely 360 degree turn, allowing us to notice the
borgate in the near distance and to realize that they have almost completely encircled the
area. The power of this sequence lies in its capacity to convey by visual means alone the
cultural extinction to which the oblivious couple is doomed. The point is reinforced in the
dream sequence that anticipates the film’s ending, in which Accattone witnesses his own
funeral and sees a group of Neapolitan pimps lying dead on the ground, crushed beneath
the debris of new construction material.
Conclusion
While Visconti could still, at the height of the economic miracle, entertain a
Gramscian optimism towards emigration as that long-awaited hegemony capable of
solving the Southern Question, finally uniting North and South, Pasolini’s view of a

94
possible alternative to the neocapitalist onslaught was, by 1961, considerably more
apocalyptic, as his increasingly acerbic, “heretical” commentaries attest. Where his
contemporaries saw innovation and modernization, he saw only a facelift of old power
blocs manipulating a national-capitalist rather than national-popular culture, and whose
loftiest accomplishment had been more genocide than miracle.
While we may wish to spare their differing outlooks from “the enormous
condescension of posterity,” it is undeniable that internal migration was one of the chief
factors that allowed Italy to become a leading power in the global neocapitalist economy.
A consequence of the South’s enduring status as colony, internal migration demonstrated
the reliance of the nation’s miracle upon planned backwardness and inequality. The
expansion of northern monopoly capitalism, the preservation of old relations of
production, the economic and social incapacitation of the South, low wages and southern
mass migration all contributed to the “miracle” and were perpetuated by it.
In the discursive construction of the nation, internal migration served an equally
determining function. The emigrants’ relegation to peripheral space and archaic time
served to highlight their alterity with respect to the neocapitalist “developed” nation,
affirming Italy’s modernity by means of negation. This mechanism has continued to hold
enormous staying power in Italy’s self-definition, allowing it to preserve the image of a
modern nation not only with respect to its South but also through the more recent
phenomenon of foreign immigration.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
In a postscript to the 1975 edition ofL’immigrazione meridionale a Torino,
Goffredo Fofi concluded confidently that
È [...] vero che, ormai, siamo sulla strada del superamento degli squilibri tra Nord
e Sud, che l’industrializzazione del Mezzogiorno è in atto, che la “questione
meridionale” non è piú cosí lontana dalla soluzione come si poteva temere fino a
pochissimi anni addietro. L’Italia, in questi anni, è profondamente cambiata, e nei
prossimi cambierà ancora di molto. L’immigrazione meridionale a Torino è un
esempio di come i cambiamenti sono avvenuti.
1
Fofi’s optimism notwithstanding, neither the disparities between North and South nor the
emigration phenomenon and its function in the perennial “re-making” of Italy drew their
final breath with the advent of the economic miracle. Admittedly, within a decade of the
miracle, it appeared as though Italian mass emigration had finally drawn to a close,
ending one of the most bitter chapters of the nation’s history. Foreign emigration began
to decline from the latter half of the 1960s, while internal migration lasted until the mid
1970s.
2
Italian cinema, typically attentive to the emigration question, did not fail to
register this altered context, albeit with significant innovations. To begin with, post-
miracle films dealing with the subject of emigration tended to abandon melodrama in
favor of comedy. Secondly, emigration was no longer represented as an epic occurrence
but rather as the consequence of personal, individual choices. In Mario Monicelli’sLa
ragazza con la pistola (1968), for instance, Monica Vitti is a young Sicilian woman who
goes to London with the intention of avenging her honor by killing the man who has
seduced and abandoned her. By the time she finds him, however, she has become
sufficiently emancipated that it is she who seduces and abandons him. In Luigi Zampa’s
Bello, onesto, emigrato Australia sposerebbe compaesana illibata (1971), Alberto
Sordi’s virginal mail order bride (Claudia Cardinale) turns out to be a prostitute on the
run from her violent pimp, and upon meeting her husband-to-be in Australia, repeatedly
scoffs his hard-earned but dismal achievements. And in Franco Brusati’s 1974Pane e
cioccolata, Nino Manfredi must face the fact that, after many years of scraping a living in
Switzerland, he will never be accepted by the “civilized” Swiss nor will he ever again

belong to the class of homesick Italian emigrants eager to return to their families and
mother country. Though the comedy in these films is admittedly bitter-sweet, it is
nonetheless indicative of a society that has achieved greater self-confidence from having
overcome a shameful condition. From the apex of its success, this new Italy could look
back on its past with humor, self-irony, and perhaps even a bit of nostalgia.
Italy’s self-confidence also grew in response to the advent, from the mid-1980s
onward, of the entirely novel phenomenon of foreign immigration to Italy. These changed
circumstances formed the grounds upon which a new image of Italy was constructed: a
once-destitute country that had been forced to ship off its poor had blossomed into “the
new colossus” now attracting the global South’s tired and huddled masses. The claim that
Italy has gone from being a country of emigration to one of immigration has become so
commonplace, even among demographic experts, that it has assumed the aura of
indisputable fact. Current immigration figures would seem to give credence to this claim:
as of 2010, 4.2 million foreign immigrants, half of them from Eastern Europe, were found
to be residing in Italy.
3
 Moreover, given the recent events in northern Africa that have set
off migration waves from Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, this number is liable to grow
considerably.
4
 While most of these newcomers state their intention to leave Italy for
France and northern Europe, it is difficult to foresee how this situation will ultimately
unfold, especially given the uncertain fate of Libya and the countless numbers of African
migrants and refugees still imprisoned there.
5
Though immigration to Italy has undoubtedly presented certain novelties with
respect to the phenomenon of internal migration in the postwar era, such as the
racialization of the migrants and the heightening of discrimination against them (due,
among other factors, to the xenophobic politics of the Northern League in the current
Right-Wing government coalition), it also bears significant continuities. The most
important of these is the relationship the Italian state has forged with these new residents.
As anyone familiar with Italian postwar emigration will realize, Italy’s current
immigration law governing who may enter the country and obtain a residency permit is
highly reminiscent of the Fascist anti-urbanization law that remained in effect until 1961.
Law number 189, also known as the “Bossi-Fini law” after the names of the politicians
who proposed it, came into effect in 2002. Essentially a “new and improved” version of
the former anti-urbanization measure, this law stipulates that immigrants may only obtain
legal residency if they have first procured work and housing from outside the country – a
virtual impossibility. Moreover, the fingerprinting required of new immigrants

 In the first three months of 2011, the southern Italian island of Lampedusa has witnessed the
arrival of some 20,000 migrants, prompting the Italian Minister of the Interior, Roberto Maroni, and the
Foreign Minister, Franco Frattini, to make dramatic claims regarding a “biblical exodus.” See “Maroni:

automatically categorizes them as criminals simply for having entered Italy.
6
 By
rendering legal residence and employment nearly impossible to obtain, the Bossi-Fini law
induces countless immigrants into a condition of illegality, and, much like the anti-
urbanization law, weakens their legal position and economic bargaining power, turning
them into a highly exploitable resource for the nation’s economy.
Postwar emigration thus forms a valuable point of reference for recognizing the
discriminatory nature of current immigration policy. At the same time, it can also serve to
alert the public to new forms of emigration investing the country. While it is indisputable
that Italy has become a destination of immigration, it is equally accurate to say that it is
still a nation of emigrants. Not surprisingly, given the much less flattering portrait it
paints of Italy, mass emigration has resumed under almost complete silence on the part of
social institutions and mass media. While these remain galvanized by the influx of
foreign immigrants, a growing number of southern Italian emigrants are disappearing into
the fog of oblivion. This is much more than the oft-toutedfuga dei cervelli (“brain-
drain”) – a term which in any case served to coat an unseemly occurrence with a veneer
of respectability. Rather, the latest wave of emigration involves predominantly the
South’s unemployed and working poor.
Receiving scant public attention, the announcement of the resumption of
emigration appeared in SVIMEZ’s 2010 annual report.
7
  This state agency, which has the
task of monitoring the development of trade and industry in the South, found the recent
upsurge in emigration to be connected to the deplorable state of the economy in southern
Italy. Since the mid 1990s, “official” emigration figures, which encompass only those
who officially change their place of residence, have averaged some 70,000 units per year.
In 2008, however, that number rose to 122,000 and has been steadily climbing,
amounting to over 1 million southerners in fifteen years. Of these, 87% come from the
regions of Campania, Puglia, and Sicily.
8
However, given that emigration has become highly “serialized,” meaning that it is
frequently repeated since it no longer provides the stable, lasting solution it once did, the
majority of those emigrating or moving for seasonal work do not even bother to change
their official place of residence. Consequently, the actual numbers of southern emigration
is liable to be considerably higher and remains difficult to calculate. A rare glimpse of
this “silent” emigration was offered in 2008 by Giampaolo Visetti in an article written for
La Repubblica titled “2008 Fuga dalla Campania. I nuovi poveri, sfollati al Nord.”
(“2008 Escape from Campania. The new poor evacuated to the North”). Visetti described
the dramatic character of this new form of emigration: every week, thousands of
unemployed men head North aboard trains and vans to work in industries or on
construction sites paying them twenty euros a day, under the table. Their poverty is so
acute that they take sack lunches from home to cover their meals for the entire week and
many sleep in the same vans that have transported them north. After working for a week,

they return home to their families for one day before repeating the same exercise the
following week.
9
That this new form of emigration, and the alarming social conditions generating
it, should remain under the radar is not surprising: if southerners are setting off on
another long march a mere two decades after internal migration was declared a closed
chapter, then the overall performance of Italian political and economic leaders can only
be interpreted as an abismal failure. In the South, where some 6 million people are
officially categorized as poor, the economic “miracle” remained but a mirage: in
Campania, three out of every ten families lack the most basic necessities for survival,
eight out of ten cannot afford to pay the rent, and two out of ten do not eat more than
three meals a week.
10
 In areas like Naples, unemployment  has reached 40%,
11
 while 50%
of the South’s entire working population earns less than 500 Euros per month.
12
 Dismal
as they may be, these figures describe the situation preceding the global economic crisis,
suggesting that current conditions may be even more dramatic. With such staggering
unemployment and unrelenting poverty, it is little wonder that in 2007 alone Naples lost
14% of its population to emigration.
13
This radically skewed context has provided extremely fertile ground for organized
crime, which has become the primary investor and employer in the South. Its profits are
based largely on drug trafficking and the even more lucrative enterprise of “managing”
Europe’s toxic waste disposal, a scenario amply described in Roberto Saviano’s
bestselling reportage,Gomorra.
14
 The vacuum of opportunities and hope has allowed
organized crime to become not only a state within the state (il sistema), but also to
ammass an empire that grows wealthier and more powerful each year. A study conducted
by Confesercenti
15
 estimated the yearly profits of organized crime to amount to 130
billion Euros, making “Mafia S.p.a.” (“Mafia, Inc.”) Italy’s wealthiest enterprise and
giving the label “Made in Italy” a whole new meaning.
This year, 2011, marks the 150 year anniversary of Italian national unification.
Yet for obvious reasons, national cohesion remains as problematic as ever. As the
celebrations for the unification of Italy got under way on March 17
th
, only a small
minority of the southern population participated in the festivities with heartfelt
enthusiasm. When asked how he was celebrating that day, an acquaintance offered a
reply that effectively summed up the general attitude prevalent around Naples: “What is
it that we are supposed to be celebrating? Having been colonized? When the South will
be equal to the North and we will no longer be second-class citizens, perhaps in another
150 years, then maybe we will have something to celebrate.”
The occlusion of recent and on-going emigration strengthens the rhetoric of the
nation’s triumph over the internal and external foes who would keep it divided. Italy

today is strong and united, so the narrative would have it, because it conquered the
poverty and “backwardness” that once impelled mass emigration. The closure provided in
the Italian imaginary by the supposed end of mass emigration is supported by the recent
trend to “museumify” this history. Between Genoa, Rome and Naples, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs has undertaken a project to install a triad of national emigration
museums, with a central division, the Museo Nazionale Emigrazione Italiana (MEI), to
be located in Rome. To date, the only one of such museums to have gotten under way is
located in Genoa, where, since 2008, the Galata Museo del Mare has been hosting an
exhibit tit ledAmerica! From Genoa to Ellis Island. The Sea Voyage at the Time of Italian
Emigration. Spanning three galleries and covering 1200 square meters, the exhibit
features an impressive reconstruction of Genoa’s old harbor and of the ocean-going
vesselTaormina. For 11 euros, visitors can experience “virtually” the emigrants’ voyage
to the New World. Once aboard, they search for their berths and explore the public areas
of the ship, such as the refectory, common bathrooms, infirmary, and even the prison that
once housed the “violent and clandestine” emigrants. The visit ends with the “arrival” at
Ellis Island, where visitors go through mock immigration procedures and medical visits,
and end their journey in front of a giant vista of New York.
16
The co-production of the expo by the Ellis Island Immigration Museum and the
collaboration of the U.S. Embassy in Rome in part explain the exhibition’s geographic
and temporal emphases. However, the limited perspective offered by such an important
historical project unfortunately cultivates a very selective memory of Italian emigration.
The title alone of the exhibit has the effect of circumscribing Italian emigration to
transoceanic destinations, as well as relegating it to the distant nineteenth century. More
recent migration experiences, particularly those of the postwar period that were directed
to Europe and northern Italy, are for all practical purposes ignored, and emigration is
reshaped into a product safe for the touristic consumption of the nation’s past.
The exhibition is indicative of a more general removal of recent emigration
experiences from Italian history. By disregarding postwar emigration, national emigration
histories erase the “scar tissue” produced by the nation’s spatio-temporal struggle against
its internal Others. Milan’s “Koreas” remain forgotten residues of Italy’s path to
modernit y and Ro me’sborgate seldom generate discussions of exclusionary politics, past
or present. At the same time, the concentration of museums in harbor cities like Genoa
and Naples shifts public attention from the spaces evacuated by emigration, obliterating
even the memory of once vibrant centers of life that today lie crumbling beneath the
weight of desertion and forgetting. Such museumified representations of Italian
emigration function, much like the texts examined in chapters One through Three, to
remove the internal Other in space and time, producing a figure the nation can afford to
recall only as extinct – a “Last of the Mohicans” who can no longer threaten the
homogenous order of national space. This process of collective forgetting is, as Milan
Kundera teaches us, part of the periodic refashioning of national histories: “The first step
in liquidating a people,” he observed, “is to erase its memory. Destroy its books, its
culture, its history. Then have somebody write new books, manufacture a new culture,
invent a new history. Before long the nation will begin to forget what it is and what it

was. [....] The struggle of man against power is [thus] the struggle of memory against
forgetting.”
17
In Italy, the struggle against forgetting can begin by looking to the marginal
spaces of emigration, recovering shared experiences of interdiction and segregation that
go against the grain of sanitized national narratives and recognize the heterogeneity of
Italy’s identities. By uncovering how constructions of migrant Others have intersected
over time, such a project of historical recovery would not be a mere exercise of looking
back to the past but would instead be oriented towards the articulation of a possible future
in which hybridit y beco mes the valuable basis for radical social transformat ion.
Reflecting on the nature of diasporic identities, Stuart Hall once claimed that
Diaspora does not refer us to those scattered tribes whose identity can only be
secured in relation to some sacred homeland to which they must at all costs
return, even if it means pushing other people into the sea. This is the old, the
imperialising, the hegemonising, form of ‘ethnicity’. We have seen the fate of the
people of Palestine at the hands of this backward-looking conception of diaspora
– and the complicity of the West with it. The diaspora experience as I intend it
here is defined, not by essence or purity, but by the recognition of a necessary
heterogeneity and diversity; by a conception of ‘identity’ which lives with and
through, not despite, difference; byhybridity. Diaspora identities are those which
are constantly producing and reproducing themselves anew, through
transformation and difference.
18
After all,spaesamento, that condition of ambiguous nationlessness once imputed to
Italy’s emigrants, has now become a universal condition of life, the “exodus” that
characterizes our existence in a “globalized” world. While the marginalization inherent to
modernity has indeed, as Pasolini lamented, signified the disappearance of entire ways of
life, it has also generated new peripatetic subjectivities bound to wear down the walls
modernity erected between an illusory “home” and the menacing “foreigner,” generating
what Theodor Adorno once observed with remarkable foresight, “the new morality [...]
to not be at home in one’s home.”
