SU NATO JOINT FORCE TRAINING CENTRE
Whether through training or capability building, JFTC remains on the cutting edge of enhancing NATO’s ability to project stability, deter adversaries and defend the Alliance.

About us

Officially established in 2004 in Bydgoszcz, Poland the Joint Force Training Centre quickly assumed a significant role within the NATO training community.
In 2009, JFTC moved into a newly built, state-of-the-art facility with advanced Communication and Information System architecture. Capable of supporting up to Joint Force Command level exercises, JFTC provides NATO with a flexible, cost effective training centre for current operations, emerging requirements, readiness, certification exercises and modern platform for experimentation.
The training events, conferences and courses conducted by JFTC throughout the years have proven the centre a critical part of NATO’s training capability.

Our motto

At the Joint Force Training Centre, we live our motto, “Transformation Through Training”. By synthesizing NATO training requirements with cutting-edge technology, flexible Communication and Information System architecture and responsive, scalable support, JFTC occupies a critical spot in the NATO transformation process.

Staff

The Joint Force Training Centre is manned by 170 soldiers and civilians, with the expertise to support a wide range of NATO training. Our team represents 21 NATO nations (Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Türkiye, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) and 1 Partnership for Peace nation (Georgia).

Our Mission

The Joint Force Training Centre plans, prepares, and executes static and distributed combined and joint training in support of warfighting readiness.
The Joint Force Training Centre is committed to warfare development through concept development and maintenance of joint doctrine and standards while coordinating the integration of experimentation, capability development, and interoperability to improve NATO’s interoperability, capabilities, and operational effectiveness.
The Joint Force Training Centre contributes to the development and strengthening of relationships and the integration of national training and command organisations, regional security organizations, and partners in accordance with established policy and principles.

Support to Current Operations. JFTC is the focal point of NATO pre-deployment training

Building on its vast experience from the International Security Assistance Force and Resolute Support Mission pre-deployment training, JFTC continues the mission-focused training for both headquarters and advisors deploying to the NATO Mission Iraq. JFTC ensures that trainees gain the knowledge, flexibility and capability to train, advise and assist their counterparts while laying the groundwork for their long-term sustainment.

Support to future operations. JFTC is a key venue for NATO Command Structure/NATO Force Structure exercises

JFTC actively supports NATO Command Structure and NATO Force Structure. It facilitates various exercises for NATO and National Headquarters, including operational level headquarters (such as Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum or Allied Joint Force Command Naples). The Centre also provides capable Training Teams to augment Exercise Control elements in other training events and exercises.

Support to warfare development. JFTC is a state-of-the-art platform for experimentation and innovation

JFTC with its modern IT platform provides an ideal environment for future training-related transformational technical activities. The centre hosts and conducts sophisticated tests and experiments of capabilities that can be used in support of allied training and operations. JFTC is also the home of NATO’s annual Coalition Warrior Interoperability Exercise (CWIX), the NATO’s premier interoperability event. CWIX attracts around 1500 participants from close to 40 NATO and Partner Nations and multiple NATO commands, agencies, and organizations.

Emerging endeavours

Simultaneously, JFTC is working intensively on emerging endeavours. In 2016, for example, JFTC took the lead in developing NATO-Georgia exercises and in conducting the NATO-Georgia mentoring programme that evolved into a partnership programme based on the Partnership Agreement signed in 2020.
