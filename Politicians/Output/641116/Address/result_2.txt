Annotation
The Guardia Civil (Civil Guard) in Spain, established in 1844, has adapted to new ideals in modern, democratic Spain, yet its centralized character and military structure could slow down its own modernization.
Abstract
The Guardia Civil was established to replace the army for the maintenance of public order. This role was especially challenged during the changeover to democracy after the death of Franco in 1975. External and internal structural transitions and the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a military police organization in Spain are reviewed. 4 notes
