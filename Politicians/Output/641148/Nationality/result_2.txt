Religious Festivals in Andalusia
Discover some of the religious celebrations from the 20th century

By Andalusian Archives

Archivos de Andalucía

Festivals and folklore express the shared culture of a community, encompassing its historic and sociocultural traditions and the ways these are expressed publicly.

The exhibition will see various documents—safeguarded in our archives—put on display. These are pictorial testimonies compiling some of the most important religious festivals celebrated in Andalusia throughout the 20th century, such as pilgrimages, Holy Week, and Corpus Christi.

Religious festivals

Spain no longer has an official religion, but the Catholic tradition is deeply rooted in its cultural and social life, and, in particular, in the way in which its communities express their celebrations and festivals.

These include Semana Santa, Corpus Christi, and some of Andalusia's most important pilgrimages. The long tradition and large popular following of these festivals make them good examples of expressions of popular Catholicism in Spain.

Pilgrimages

Pilgrimages are among the most commonly celebrated cultural and religious events in Andalusia, with some of them dating back to the Middle Ages.

These pilgrimages are usually undertaken on foot, on horseback, or by wagon to a sanctuary or hermitage where a statue of the Virgin Mary or a saint is venerated. They are held on a particular day of the year and take the form of a procession.

They are religious and social events, some of which have been declared Festivals of Tourist and Cultural Interest as a result of their combination of religious, folkloric, and cultural elements.

The image shown here is a snapshot of the Pilgrimage of the Virgin of La Rábida, the patron saint of Sanlúcar de Guadiana, Huelva. A statue of the Virgin is carried on the shoulders of residents and there are dancers from the town.

The Dance of the Virgin of La Rábida (also known as the dance of the flowers) was designated a Spanish Point of Cultural Interest in 2011.

The pilgrimage of the Virgin of El Rocío

The pilgrimage of El Rocío, commonly known simply as "El Rocío," is one of the best-known pilgrimages in Spain, attracting enormous crowds.

Every year on Whit Monday (the Monday after Pentecost), over a million people gather around the hermitage housing the statue of the Virgin of El Rocío, located in the village of the same name. People travel from all over Spain and from abroad.

Pilgrims arrive on foot, on horseback, or in carriages, traveling large distances to reach the village. In the early hours of Whit Monday, the inhabitants of Almonte carry out a tradition called "saltar la reja." They "jump the gate" of the hermitage and remove the statue of the Virgin of El Rocío (also known as the "Paloma Blanca," or white dove; and the "Reina de las Marismas," or queen of the marshlands). They then begin their procession around the village, stopping off at its various confraternities.

This photograph, taken in 1970, shows the procession of the Virgin of El Rocio around the village.

Corpus Christi

Corpus Christi is one of the most important Catholic feast days. Its origins are medieval and it takes place once a year, 60 days after Easter Sunday, in exaltation of the Eucharist. The Eucharist is a sacrament involving the consecration of bread and wine (in memory of the death and resurrection of Jesus)%20which%20are%20distributed%20among%20the%20faithful%2C%20just%20as%20Jesus%20did%20during%20his%20last%20supper%20with%20the%20disciples.%0A%0AThe%20significance%20of%20the%20feast%20of%20Corpus%20Christi%20is%20such%20that%20it%20is%20celebrated%20throughout%20Spain.%20Some%20of%20the%20celebrations%20in%20particular%20towns%20and%20villages%20are%20considered%20to%20be%20of%20socio-religious%20importance%20and%20have%20been%20designated%20as%20festivals%20of%20National%20Tourist%20Interest%20in%20Spain.%0A%0AThey%20include%20the%20Corpus%20Christi%20celebrations%20in%20La%20Puebla%20del%20R%C3%ADo%20(Seville)%20and%20Zahara%20de%20la%20Sierra%20(C%C3%A1diz).%0A%0AThis%20brochure%2C%20from%20our%20archives%2C%20is%20a%20promotional%20leaflet%20dated%201960%20for%20the%20Corpus%20Christi%20festivities%20and%20the%20%22D%C3%ADa%20de%20la%20Provincia%22%20(Day%20of%20the%20Province)%2C%20celebrated%20in%20Ronda%20(M%C3%A1laga).%20It%20shows%20how%20the%20religious%20feast%20was%20combined%20with%20a%20secular%20festival.%0A%0ACorpus%20Christi%20in%20Granada%0A%0AThe%20city%20of%20Granada%20puts%20on%20a%20packed%20schedule%20of%20secular%20and%20religious%20activities%20organized%20around%20the%20feast%20of%20Corpus%20Christi%2C%20and%20the%20whole%20city%20is%20decorated%20for%20the%20festivities.%20The%20activities%20include%20plays%2C%20concerts%2C%20shows%2C%20parades%2C%20and%20the%20city%27s%20fair%2C%20which%20runs%20from%20the%20Monday%20before%20Corpus%20Christi%20right%20through%20to%20the%20Sunday%20after%20it.%0A%0AOn%20the%20Thursday%20of%20the%20Corpus%20Christi%20festivities%2C%20the%20residents%20of%20Granada%20fill%20the%20streets%20to%20watch%20the%20solemn%20procession%20of%20the%20Gothic%20monstrance%20that%20was%20a%20gift%20of%20Isabella%20I%20from%20Castile%20in%201501.%0A%0AThe%20image%20shows%20a%20detail%20from%20the%20temporary%20structures%20that%20are%20traditionally%20erected%20for%20the%20500-year-old%20celebration.%0A%0ASemana%20Santa%0A%0ADuring%20Semana%20Santa%2C%20Christians%20commemorate%20the%20Passion%2C%20death%2C%20and%20resurrection%20of%20Jesus%20Christ.%0A%0AThe%20reformist%20movement%20in%20Andalusia%20during%20the%20late%2015th%20and%20early%2016th%20centuries%20led%20to%20the%20emergence%20of%20confraternities%20and%20religious%20brotherhoods%2C%20which%20spread%20throughout%20Spain.%20Today%2C%20one%20of%20the%20roles%20performed%20by%20members%20of%20these%20organizations%20is%20to%20carry%20the%20religious%20statues%20during%20the%20processions%20that%20take%20place%20throughout%20Semana%20Santa.%0A%0AThe%20main%20purpose%20of%20the%20confraternities%20and%20religious%20brotherhoods%20is%20to%20support%20and%20comfort%20their%20members%20in%20difficult%20times.%20They%20have%20traditionally%20been%20responsible%20for%20providing%20support%20for%20burials%2C%20almshouses%2C%20hospitals%2C%20and%20other%20types%20of%20care%20and%20relief.%0A%0A%EE%80%B7%0ASaeta%2C%20Manuel%20Torre%0A00%3A00%0A%0AEvery%20year%20during%20Semana%20Santa%2C%20Christians%20across%20the%20world%20hold%20processions%2C%20taking%20to%20the%20streets%20to%20express%20their%20faith.%0A%0AThis%20photograph%2C%20taken%20in%201905%2C%20shows%20a%20float%20with%20a%20canopy%20and%20a%20statue%20of%20the%20Virgin%20of%20the%20Angels%2C%20belonging%20to%20the%20Sevillian%20Los%20Negritos%20Confraternity.%20The%20confraternity%27s%20name%20refers%20to%20the%20people%20who%20founded%20it%20in%20the%20early%20modern%20period%2C%20who%20were%20mainly%20African%20slaves.%0A%0ASemana%20Santa%20in%20Seville%0A%0AThe%20main%20event%20of%20Semana%20Santa%20is%20the%20penance%20procession%2C%20which%20traditionally%20took%20place%20with%20just%20a%20parish%20cross%2C%20rather%20than%20elaborate%20floats%20or%20statues.%0A%0AIn%20the%20early%2017th%20century%2C%20the%20confraternities%20and%20religious%20brotherhoods%20agreed%20to%20carry%20statues%20on%20floats%20during%20the%20processions.%20The%20processions%20took%20place%20throughout%20the%20streets%20of%20Seville%2C%20with%20the%20penance%20procession%20heading%20towards%20the%20cathedral.%0A%0AThis%20was%20the%20catalyst%20for%20the%20re-emergence%20of%20religious%20imagery%2C%20with%20renowned%20sculptors%20such%20as%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Monta%C3%B1ez%20and%20Pedro%20Rold%C3%A1n%20being%20commissioned%20to%20produce%20the%20statues.%20They%20sculpted%20wooden%20statues%20of%20images%20previously%20depicted%20on%20canvases%20or%20banners.%0A%0A%EE%80%B7%0ASaeta%2C%20autor%20desconocido%0A00%3A00%0A%0AThe%20photograph%20shows%20the%20float%20of%20Nuestro%20Padre%20Jes%C3%BAs%20del%20Gran%20Poder%20(Our%20Father%20Jesus%20of%20the%20Great%20Power)%2C%20a%20statue%20that%20is%20revered%20by%20the%20people%20of%20Seville.%20He%20is%20dressed%20in%20a%20plain%20tunic%20made%20from%20silver%20lam%C3%A9%20fabric%2C%20which%20may%20be%20the%20so-called%20%22blanca%22%20(white%20tunic)%20in%20which%20he%20was%20dressed%20for%20the%20%22Madrugada%22%20(

of 1908.

The sculptor responsible for this statue was unknown until 1930, when the historian Sancho Corbacho discovered evidence revealing it to be the work of the sculptor Juan de Mesa in 1620.

This photograph, taken in 1930, shows the float of the Virgin of the Victory belonging to the Cigarreras Confraternity, presided over by Alfonso XIII of Spain.

The king, who held the position of "Hermano Mayor" (the most senior elder in the confraternity) presided over the procession through the streets of Seville on more than one occasion. He granted the confraternity the privilege of carrying the purple banner of Castile in front of the float bearing the Virgin Mary.
