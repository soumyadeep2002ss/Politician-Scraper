A full, intense week at #UNGA running from meeting to meeting and trying to find multilateral responses to the world’s most pressing challenges in line with our strategic priorities at AGENCIA ESPAÑOLA DE COOPERACION INTERNACIONAL PARA EL DESARROLLO - AECID.

Some of the questions that kept us busy this week:

🔴 Humanitarian aid - how can we mobilize additional resources and become more effective in responding to crisis contexts like Sudan, Haiti, Palestine or Ukraine?

🟡 Financing for development - what levers can we use to bridge the SDG financing gap and contribute to the much-needed acceleration in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda?

🟢 Climate emergency - what is the role of development cooperation and development/climate finance to address the needs of Global South countries in order to avoid a choice between climate action and other key priorities like poverty alleviation?

🟤 Food security - how can we work in the short term to fight the increase in hunger and food insecurity around the world while building more sustainable, resilient food systems?

🟣 Gender equality - how can a feminist development cooperation policy promote women empowerment and protect the rights of women and girls, including sexual and reproductive rights?

An opportunity also to meet partners and allies like USAID Adaptation Fund UNDP Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Unitaid The World Bank World Food Programme UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)

It has been a big pleasure to open today in Geneva with Robert Mardini the second International Committee of the Red Cross - ICRC  Donor Support Group Policy Forum co-chaired by Spain 🇪🇸 and focused on access and protection of health care in armed conflict.

Very timely discussion. International Humanitarian Law is not optional. It must be respected by everyone, everywhere.

🌍 Just back fron #cop28 in Dubai. A great opportunity to reiterate the strong commitment of AGENCIA ESPAÑOLA DE COOPERACION INTERNACIONAL PARA EL DESARROLLO - AECID to working with our partners to preserve our planet, foster ambitious climate action and promote a just transition that leaves no one behind. 

🙌 Encouraged by the sense of urgency and the important progress on loss and damage and adaptation.

🟢 AECID has tripled its green ODA since 2019 and this year we approved loans worth €164M million of climate finance, in line with Spain’s target to increase climate finance levels by 50% in 2025.

🟢 In Dubai, our Prime Minister announced our €2M contribution to development of Amazon bonds as a key financing instrument for sustainable development in the Amazon basin in partnership with Inter-American Development Bank and The World Bank. We also committed €1,5M to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies - IFRC Global Climate Resilience Platform and remain active in the Spain-Senegal-led International Drought Resilience Alliance (IDRA).

🟢 We organized two events at the Spanish pavilion, one on finance and partnerships for the just transition with close friends and allies like International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) Adaptation Fund GAWA Capital World Health Organization and another one on the crucial role of indigenous peoples in the Amazon basin in partnership with the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization - ACTO  and throughout Latin America and the Caribbean as actors of change to protect biodiversity while preserving their economic, social and cultural rights.

🟢 We participated in debates concerning the new loss and damage fund and anticipatory action to mitigate the humanitarian consequences of the climate crisis, as well as the interplay between climate action and other key priorities for a just transition such as gender equality, children’s rights and global health.
