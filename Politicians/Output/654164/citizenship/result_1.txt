# 52 the Italian ‘ Second Level ’ in Search of Identity : Transformation of the Province and the Birth of the Metropolitan City

2016 •

Annick Magnier

In 2014, the Italian government approved an important local government reform, through Law no. 56. Concerning Metropolitan Cities, Provinces, Unions and Amalgamations of Municipalities. The Law suppresses second-tier institutions (provinces) except in the main metropolitan areas, transforms the remaining second-tier institutions into indirectly elected bodies, and redesigns their functions. Here, this innovation is scrutinised. A secondary analysis is combined with an original analysis of the statutes adopted in metropolitan cities, the results of the first indirect election of their presidents, and Italian data from a European comparative survey on second-tier local governments, administered two years before the reform. The reform was designed to control the ‘costs of politics’ and to define a model of governance for metropolitan areas. However, it leaves many crucial problems unsolved, and delegates many decisions on the implementation of the model to the regions. As shown in the ...

The Establishment of Metropolitan Cities in Italy: An Advance or a Setback for Italian Regionalism?

Giovanni Boggero

This paper aims to provide a brief assessment of the legal framework of the newly established metropolitan cities in the Italian domestic legal order. After an historical overview of previous attempts to set up metropolitan cities in Italy (1), it summarizes the main statutory provisions of the Delrio Law (No. 56/2014) through which metropolitan cities finally came into operation (2) and it provides an analysis of its implementation, thereby attempting to make clear whether increased institutional pluralism and differentiation in the local government system will strengthen or weaken Italian regionalism (3). The conclusion will argue that, while the enactment of local government reforms combined with the entering into force of a significant constitutional amendment will increasingly diminish the role of the Regions, metropolitan cities, due to their ambivalent nature, still lack any propulsive thrust and face the risk of being marginalized until a consistent legal framework for their proper funding is laid down (4).

Daniela Adorni

This paper (1) examines two areas of Italy, with very different political subcultures and production systems, with the aim of making a comparative analysis of the role of local government policies in stimulating growth processes over the thirty-year post war period. Historians now agree that the policies of Italian local governments were a major factor in the processes of economic growth and the spread of social services. They acted through a highly varied mix of policies, including regulatory processes (town planning, coordinated local programming, etc.), operations enabling institutions to provide the local environment with specific public goods (industrial estates, business services etc.) as well as redistribution policies (i.e. the setting up and spread of local welfare systems and local tax systems). This influential steering role of local administrations, marked in some cases by the gradual inception of specific institutional authoritativeness, was not distributed uniformly ov...

A new governance for a new urban form

2019 •

Giovanni Caudo

The crisis is not a local issue, it is not reduced to the problem of potholes or waste on the street, that is the things we read daily in the newspapers. What we need to understand is rather what Rome can become in the 21st century, how it can draw its role with respect to the political class, which is absent, and to the intermediate social class.

The Paradigmatic case of the Metropolitan City of Florence

Giuseppe De Luca

In 2015 was held in Barcelona the first Conference On Territorial Competitiveness and Social Cohesion in European Metropoles. The Conference went around four key words: competitiveness, governace, social cohesion, cooperation; and ended with a ten-point final Declaration and a Document of Conclusion. The paper will use the Barcelona's final document as compared to discuss the knot of governance in the case of the Metropolitan City of Florence. The case is the "light" of superficiality with which implemented the choise of metropolitan areas in Italy. It is a fine example of the distance between the territory of the real economy and the institutional territory one.

Urban and Social Reform in the Reshaping of Local Administration. -Rosario 1915 / 1935

Ana Rigotti

In Argentina, since the beginning of the century, there was a growing consensus on social politics as a suitable strategy-alternative to repression-to confront urban labor conflict. The State interest in labor conditions was soon complemented by an increasing concern on the reproductive sphere, mainly housing; a concern that justified a displacement of the social question to an urban question, refocusing attention from salaries to scarcity and living cost. In our paper we analyze the ways in which the Municipality of Rosario translates and applies certain discourses, institutions and models about public housing and City growth developed in Buenos Aires in relation to modernization, working force reproduction, social conciliation, immigrants integration and national identity reinforcement. This was a social movement within the elite. Political parties, professional associations and real state developers devised projects leading to control and shape urban growth, reorganize the bureaucratic administration, promote low cost housing, expand and decentralize urban services, extend political participation and increase municipal autonomy, all this in the name of "those who have less". It was a local experience related to a peculiar tradition that questioned "politics" and included the government of a City under the concept of "administration". It supplied support to the redefinition of City management as an active corporation, capable to invest and participate in urban development. The improvement of industrial productivity was not the axis of this reforming politics. The aim was the productivity of the City as an economic organism, a productivity that could be measured by the increase of population, of urban land, and of commercial and industrial establishments. American Municipal Movement and French Urbanism met in this experience of urban reform understood as a science of local administration. A conjunction of civic reform, administrative rationalization, welfare polices in the local level, municipalization of essential services and new institutions to govern scarcity and social conflict. An experience where the preoccupation on urban form was restricted to the regulation of urban expansion through zoning, public housing, a regional park system and the regulation and professionalization of Engineering and Architecture..
