Executive summary 
OpenHeritage relies steadily on cases: practices and challenges on the ground. 
Therefore, strong connection and exchange with adaptive heritage re-use 
initiatives, whether run by citizen groups, municipalities or private companies, is 
a key component of research within OpenHeritage. While Cooperative Heritage 
Labs are conceived to test ideas and tools in cases in development, Observatory 
Cases explore existing practices of adaptive heritage re-use through their 
innovative community involvement methods, resource integration, territorial 
impact and heritage impact. Observatory Cases provide micro-level analysis in 
the multi-level analytical framework of OpenHeritage, focusing on a 
contextualised understanding of how adaptive re-use works in practice, how the 
specific local circumstances interact with the larger institutional and regulatory 
framework, and how this influences the outcome of the specific re-use projects.  
The selection of Observatory Cases has been designed to provide data for 
policy analysis and input to Cooperative Heritage Labs. The 16 Observatory 
Cases reflect a variety of regional experiences and geographical situations 
(urban, peri-urban and rural) across Europe; a diversity of heritage assets 
involved, including industrial, ecclesiastical, royal, administrative, military, 
residential and commercial buildings, as well as natural sites; a range of initiative 
types, from bottom-up, community-based engagements through private 
undertakings to public projects; with a mix of social, environmental or 
commercial motivations; and an array of traditional or innovative financing 
mechanisms, economic models and governance arrangements. Observatory 
Cases are ongoing, advanced experiments of adaptive re-use of heritage sites. 
They are predominantly well-established cases, with a few exceptions that are at 
different levels of development. While the earlier offer crystallised models whose 
success or failure can be determined, the latter allow the OpenHeritage 
consortium to capture their evolution through a series of snapshots at different 
moments of their development.  
The methodology of developing Observatory Cases aims at creating an in-depth 
exploration of on-the-ground experiences, relying more on personal visits, 
encounters and interviews than on academic literature. This approach was to 
ensure that Observatory Case reports are accessible, easy-to-read texts and 
describe tangible situations and practices, through which readers can not only 
have access to state-of-the-art models, mechanisms and tools but also gain an 
insight into personal motivations, values and commitments of the protagonists of 
the cases. For models, mechanisms and tools can rarely be successfully 
implemented without engaged individuals or organisations. Observatory Cases 
were distributed among 8 partners of OpenHeritage and they received guidelines 
for producing the case studies. The guidelines included a list of themes to focus 
on as well as practical recommendations like preparing the interview by sending 
all questions to interviewees in advance; meeting at least 3-4 protagonists of a 
case, ideally including initiators, policy makers, external observers; visit different 
parts of the case study site accompanied by members of the initiative 
themselves; and complete the interviews with desktop research.

The main themes of the case studies, to be explored during 
the interviews included aspects of telling the story of the initiative (actors, the 
process, influences, values, identity); an architectural analysis (the typology of 
the site or buildings, their condition at the beginning of the initiative, the uses 
envisioned in the transformation and the design principles of adaptive reuse); a 
geographical analysis (position, social, demographical and economic trends); a 
regulation and policy analysis (regulations and policies affecting the adaptive 
reuse, heritage protection, zoning, ownership and procurement issues); a 
resource analysis (financial and non-monetary resources and business plan); a 
stakeholder analysis (main actors and governance]; an impact analysis 
(reception of the project, impact on policies, knowledge production, jobs and 
services); and an analysis of the role of heritage in the adaptive reuse process. 
Once the Observatory Case studies were prepared, they went through a review 
process: appointed reviewers gave feedback to the case writers, highlighting 
missing elements in the study or askig for clarification in some matters related to 
the key components of the study. The result is a panorama of a diversity of 
efforts across Europe to reuse heritage spaces for social, cultural, economic or 
community purposes. Observatory Cases contribute to other components of 
OpenHeritage. They inform scientific research (heritage policy analysis in WP1), 
model-formation (evaluation of adaptive reuse policies (T2.4 and WP3), tool 
development (Database development in T2.3 and toolbox development in WP5) 
and implementation (Cooperative Heritage Labs in WP4) during the project.  
The studies show a general pattern of growing civic involvement in the reuse 
of vacant buildings and heritage assets throughout Europe, despite varying 
institutional and regulatory backgrounds, and highlight the innovation capacity of 
NGOs and bottom-up initiatives. The cases describe the potential that adaptive 
reuse can bring to smaller or bigger localities, and especially to underdeveloped 
areas. Among others, Stará Tržnica in Bratislava or Largo Residências in Lisbon 
clearly demonstrate that initiatives of adaptive heritage reuse can obtain the 
power necessary to influence their wider surroundings. Like the Sargfabrik in 
Vienna, which started as a small co-housing project reusing the remnants of an 
old coffin factory, and by now has changed not only a neighbourhood but also 
the way housing is thought and discussed in Vienna. Importantly, increase in 
territory size – like for the Jewish District in Budapest or the Navy Yard in 
Amsterdam – does not mean that civic initiatives become insignificant. On the 
contrary, temporary solutions and ideas pioneered by local groups have 
contributed also to the transformation of larger areas.  
Besides setting the basis for the further development of OpenHeritage, 
Observatory Cases and their dissemination will also have a broader impact. 
Many of the cases examined have a strong social mission, aiming to help the 
inclusion and integration of more vulnerable social groups, while keeping their 
activities financially and economically sustainable and saving a heritage building 
or site from abandonment. Sharing these stories through various channels of the 
OpenHeritage partnership will give insights to a wider audience into practices 
that can steer the adaptive reuse of heritage spaces towards more sustainable 
and inclusive ways.

Executive summary 
Cascina  Roccafranca is  a  multi-functional  community  centre  located  in  a  former 
farmstead in Turin’s outskirts. After 30 years of vacancy, Cascina Roccafranca was 
bought  by  the  Municipality  of  Turin  and  requalified  with  the  support  of  the 
European Union Urban II program. Today, Cascina Roccafranca is a public asset 
managed through a cooperation between public and civic actors and it provides a 
wide range of social and cultural activities. Since 2012, Cascina Roccafranca has 
been part of a network of similar community centres in Turin which was formalized 
in 2017, and today collaborates with the City Council in the management and the 
regeneration of urban commons.

2 The story of the building complex 
Cascina  Roccafranca  (Roccafranca  farmstead)  was  built  in  the  XVII  century  to 
serve as a farmhouse for the religious confraternity, Compagnia dell'Immacolata 
Concezione. In 1689, the farmhouse was sold to Count Ballard, and it is raised to 
a  feud  in  1734.  In  1840,  its  following  owner,  Baroness  Chionio,  enlarged  the 
farmhouse  and  modified  its  original  structure.  From  1957,  the  agricultural  land 
connected to the Cascina Roccafranca was progressively reduced and took over by 
the  Fiat  Mirafiori  establishment  and by  a  residential  development  aiming  at 
accommodating  workers.  In  the  1970s,  Cascina  Roccafranca  ultimately  lost  its 
function and was dismissed. Over thirty years of vacancy, this building became an 
urban  void,  degraded  by  time,  nature  and site  of  small-scale criminal activities, 
homelessness and marginalisation.  
3 The area 
Cascina  Roccafranca  is  located  in  Mirafiori  Nord,  a  neighbourhood  in  the  south-
western outskirts of Turin, six kilometres from the city centre, covering an area of

Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2

over  2,000  km2.  Its  population  grew  exponentially  in  the  1950s  with  the 
establishment  of  the  Fiat  Mirafiori  factories.  This  growth  was  managed  by  the 
construction  of  a  significant  amount  of  public  housing  in  the  area.  With  Fiat’s 
departure and the closure of many of its production facilities, from the 1990s the 
area  experienced  economic  crisis  and  growing  unemployment.  These  economic 
difficulties were accompanied by the ageing of the population and the obsolescence 
of many commercial and other economic activities.

Today, Mirafiori  Nord  has  about  25,000  inhabitants,  30%  of whom  are  over  65. 
The  area  has  been  struggling  with  severe  social  and  economic  problems: 
unemployment,  crime,  poverty,  low levels  of  education  and  training,  decaying 
buildings and public spaces, as well as environmental damage, high level of air 
and  noise  pollution  across  the  area.  On  the  other  hand,  the  area  disposes  of 
significant  green  and  open  spaces  and  has  a  history  of strong  community 
involvement and an economy with significant growth potential.  
“The Mirafiori Nord district was suitable for such a project because it is very 
heterogeneous,  it  has  many  problematic  areas  but  it  also  has  some  more 
regular-quiet sides. Moreover, the citizens' participation was central for this 
project and in fact, in Mirafiori the participation was already strong.” Renato 
Bergamin

4 The initiative 
In 2001, Torino was selected for the European Union’s URBAN II programme and 
it received 16 million euros to carry out a project requalifying the Mirafiori Nord 
area. This intervention took into consideration various type of innovative actions: 
public   space   renovation,   ecological  renewal,  an economic   intervention   for 
employment  and  trading raise, and  cultural  and  social action.  The  adaptation  of 
Cascina Roccafranca into a venue for collective use by citizens use became part of 
the  cultural  and  social  intervention  plan  of  the  Urban  II  project. In  2002,  the 
Municipality of Turin used the funds received from the Urban II project to purchase 
the Cascina Roccafranca and transform it into a space for public services. Cascina 
Roccafranca’s  transformation  into  a  community  venue  was  overseen  by  a 
committee formed for this scope.  
In  2004,  requalification  works  began.  During  the  redevelopment,  in  2006,  the 
building’s  management  was  assigned  to  the Fondazione  Cascina  Roccafranca, a 
foundation established to represent a group of formal and informal organisations 
who  aimed  to  requalify  the  building  and  to  transform  it  into  a  multipurpose 
neighbourhood centre. In 2007, Cascina Roccafranca opened its doors.

5 The complex and its reconstruction 
“The first time we entered the site, it was a small forest with trees. People 
experienced  it  not  just  as  a  degraded  building  but  also  as  a  dangerous 
place.” Renato Bergamin  
Cascina Roccafranca was originally a farmstead, a typical structure present in the 
Italian countryside and particularly in the Piedmont region. Constructed in the 17
th
 
century, it did not have any rare architectural significance, yet with its 2500 square 
meter buildings and 2000 square meter courtyard, it had a significant place in local 
history   and   the   community’s   memory.   Dismissed   due   to   the   increasing 
industrialization  of  the  area,  Cascina  Roccafranca  represents  a  bridge  between 
agronomic life and cooperative economy.  
When  it  was  selected  for  renovation,  the  buildings’ infrastructure  was  in  a 
deteriorated state, covered by vegetation and with structural problems. Already 
before its renovation, the building was defined as a site for service provision so 
no changes of land use regulations were needed. The building was not protected 
heritage either:  it  did  not  have  any  specific  artistic  value  and  there  were  no 
restrictions concerning its reuse, so the architectural project was free to change 
its physical aspects. Nevertheless, while the complex was entirely rebuilt following 
contemporary safety and environmental norms, its design was also trying to evoke 
its original historical appearance.

One of the biggest challenges in the reconstruction process was to create a 
space  that  would  adapt  to  a  wide  range  of  activities  while  presenting  a  unique 
style. The main concept of the building is to create a multifunctional and inclusive 
space that would welcome a wide range and activities and audiences, but which 
would also have a clear identity and style. Glass and transparent surfaces were 
used to convey inclusivity and openness, but architectural features important for 
the identity and the recognizability of the place, such as brick, the door and window 
fixtures, were maintained.  
“This  building  is  ‘transparent’  to  facilitate  the  idea  of  sharing  and  of 
publicness. In the past there have been similar activities in the district but 
they were not concentrated in a space but carried out in rented spaces often 
in former classrooms or basements – never in a beautifully designed space.” 
Stefania Ieluzzi

Cascina Roccafranca today is divided into five parts that refer to the pre-existing 
spaces in the ancient Cascina. The canopy, originally used as storage, is today's 
main entrance to Cascina Roccafranca. It features an entrance hall, the reception 
area, the “Piazza,” a play area and baby parking, and an incubator space. Rooms 
are situated around the high-ceiling central space, often used for public initiatives. 
On the upper floor, there is a mezzanine that is connected to all the other floors 
of the structure. The stall is the best-preserved part of the old farmhouse and it

has been restored respecting the original architecture. On the ground floor, it hosts 
the  cafeteria,  a  space  accessible  from  the  entrance  hall,  directly  from  the 
pedestrian entrance on Via Rubino, from the inner courtyard, from the villa and 
from the barn; on the first floor there are multimedia rooms, artistic workshops 
and classrooms. The villa is the most ancient part of the venue but it was also the 
most  degraded.  It  was  completely  rebuilt  following  its  original  structure  and 
preserving  its  architectural  style.  Today,  it  hosts  the  area’s  Ecomuseum  on  the 
ground floor, while the two upper floors are used as administrative offices. The 
barn, on the ground floor, hosts a restaurant and on the upper floor a large room 
used  for  meetings,  gatherings  and  parties.  The  restaurant  has  preserved  the 
original  arches  and  it  has  a  glazed  wall  facing  the  courtyard.  The internal 
courtyard is a passage point connecting all parts of the building and it is used in 
summer for events.

“These spaces have a spirit, a vibe, but not an exclusive spirit. In the same 
room,  you  can  have  yoga  in  the  morning,  children's  activities  in  the 
afternoon, in the evening the meeting of another group. Space is shared and 
it has to be adapted to everybody's needs.” Stefania de Masi 
The  participatory  planning  process  around  the  conception  of  the  Cascina 
Roccafranca fed into the new venue’s planning with many ideas. The idea of total 
accessibility, with no barriers and thresholds of control, like in a public living room, 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Cascina Roccafranca Observatory Case

came  from  this  process;  and  so  did  the  idea  of  architectural  transparency  that 
allows people to see what is happening inside the building.  
“At the beginning some people were upset, but eventually, everyone 
appreciated it because it has a fair mix of elements that somehow recall 
the past but they also suggest modernity. The high-quality refurbishment 
is as important as is the originality. All these elements give a positive 
image of the venue itself.” Renato Bergamin  
6 Community involvement 
The  Cascina  Roccafranca  project  was  developed  following  the  indications  of  the 
community living in the Mirafiori area. At the end of the 1990s, the Municipality of 
Turin launched a programme to develop a requalification plan of interventions that 
would improve the environment and its daily use, and which would relaunch the 
economic activities in the Mirafiori Nord district. Over a year and a half, a group of 
formal and non-formal organisation composed by social workers, educational and 
healthcare  workers,  religious  organisations,  associations,  local  committees  and 
schools  came  together  in  a  social  forum  (tavoli  sociali)  and  discussed  possible 
innovation in their area. They brought up the need for a meeting space for the 
community and pointed Cascina Roccafranca as a suitable venue.  
 
“Using the few resources they had at the time, they were trying to develop 
new   projects   and   a   new   strategy   of   intervention   in   low-income 
neighbourhoods and in the planning of public housing.” Renato Bergamin 
In order to supervise the requalification of Cascina Roccafranca, to manage the 
project budget and the communication with the European Union, a committee with 
representatives of the municipality and of the district was formed, to be dissolved 
with  Cascina's opening.  The  committee  envisioned  the  development  as  a 
participatory  planning  project  in  close  collaboration  with  the  citizenry.  The 
committee engaged with the community on both organised and informal levels. 
Following  the  model  of  the  social  forum,  it  invited  citizens  and  associations  to 
brainstorm  about  the  features  of  the  future  community  venue  and launched an 
ideas  incubator  project  to  gather  proposal  of  activities  from  the  community.  In 
time,  citizens  and  organisations  attending  the  committee's  public meetings 
organised  themselves  into  an  association  called  Tavolo  della  2  (2's  table).  This 
Tavoli   Sociali: In   1997-98,   the   Turin   Municipality   began   Progetto 
SpecialePeriferie,   a   programme   to   requalify   its   urban   peripheries.   The 
programme  created  a  series  of  tavoli  sociali  (social  tables),  working  groups 
composed by various formal and non-formal organizations present in the area 
of intervention, for example associations, informal groups, social workers, school 
teachers;  a  variety  of  people  working,  living  and  managing  activities  in  the 
neighbourhood.  The  tables  were  coordinated  by  municipal  workers  specifically 
selected for this task. The Tavolo Sociale di Mirafiori Nord was composed of about 
60-70  people,  representing  associations,  social  workers,  health  services, 
children organisations. Discussions with them gave birth to the idea of Cascina 
Roccafranca as a community venue.

became  a  structured  assembly  of  citizens  and  local  organisations  with  regular 
meetings and a director. 
As  discovered  in  the  participatory  planning  process,  the  community  in  Mirafiori 
Nord  needed a  space  suitable  for  an  intergenerational  encounter,  which 
would supply to a wide range of necessities and interests, but which would be also 
fluid  enough  to accept constant proposals and innovations.  Cascina  Roccafranca 
was envisioned as a multi-purpose space for socialization, civic engagement and 
cultural activities, to promote an ethical lifestyle and to support the dignity and 
diversity of ethnic, religious, gender or physically challenged minorities.

The  organisation’s  goal  was  to  gather  in  the  same  space  a  variety  of  groups  of 
different age, social background and with various interests. For this reason, the 
planning committee found it fundamental to be conceived as a place welcoming 
everyone. To achieve this, initiators visited similar spaces across Italy and Europe, 
carrying out surveys and opening a discussion with the local community.  
“For us, a challenge was to imagine a space that could be used on the same 
day by users of different age. Space is shared, and everybody needs to feel 
home  but  at  the  same  time  it  has  to  be  adapted  to  everybody's  needs.” 
Stefania de Masi 
Over more than 11 years of work, Cascina Roccafranca has adapted to new needs 
that  were  not  envisioned  during  the  planning  phase.  For instance,  with  the 
economic  crisis  of  2007,  Cascina  Roccafranca  became  a  support  facility  for

residents of the neighbourhood facing unemployment or poverty as well as a centre 
for integration of the local migrant community.  
“Our  first  feasibility  study  from  2002  suggested  the  need  for  community 
wellness services, as it was a period of great economic prosperity. With the 
2007 economic crisis, we were asked also to deal also with unemployment 
and with poverty, needs we didn’t plan for when we opened the Cascina.” 
Stefania de Masi 
Creating  an  environment  that  enables  cooperation  among  various  associations 
remains a key objective of the organisation. The Cascina holds regular meetings 
with the associations working there or using the spaces of the complex, in order 
to connect long-established associations with newcomers, enhancing their dialogue 
and innovation. Together with associations, Cascina Roccafranca relies on the work 
of  volunteers  and  in-kind  service  providers.  This  district-level  network  is 
fundamental for the efficient organisation of new projects and their success. 
Besides  meetings,  Cascina  Roccafranca  also  promotes  accessibility  through  its 
open doors policy. The front desk, situated at the entrance of the complex, next 
to the cafeteria, serves as an everyday communication and reception platform. It 
is  managed  by  trained  volunteers  who  welcome  visitors,  answer  questions 
regarding  Cascina  and  the  neighbourhood,  listen  to  visitors’  requests  and 
suggestions. The role of the front desk is to gather all sort of information in regard 
to people’s demands and needs so that Cascina can reach new audiences and start 
new  projects,  strengthening  its  links  with  the  neighbourhood  and  mobilising 
youngsters.  
“It  is  hard  to  fight  social  isolation  without  available  spaces.  When  you 
provide  opportunities  and  spaces,  people  then  respond  with  a  proactive 
attitude. But you need to have some basic conditions. Cascina Roccafranca 
gives people an opportunity.” Stefania de Masi  
Cascina Roccafranca proposes a model of participatory planning and cooperation 
between citizens and the local administration. To do so, it experiments with survey 
tools to gather knowledge from the community and to put it in practice by including 
the  citizens  in  project  development.  The  work  of  cultural  animators  and  social 
animators has been essential in the evolution of Cascina Roccafranca. These social 
workers have the role of accompanying organisations and private citizens in the 
realisation of projects, providing support and the necessary tools for independent 
project  management.  They  help  those  who  propose  an  idea  but  do  not  have 
organisational experience by discussing their ideas, connecting them with potential 
partners, and providing a free venue and helping them in all the planning stages, 
sometimes for months.  
“My job requires the ability to listen and to embrace people’s projects. As a 
social worker, you have to take a step back and support the participation of 
citizens.  This  is  why  our  community is  truly  active  because  we  help  ideas 
become  projects  accompanying  them  until  their  realisation.  We  give  the 
tools to make it happen but also learn new skills from the people we meet.”

7 Activities 
In its event venues, Cascina Roccafranca hosts hundreds of activities a year, 
targeting a variety of groups and interests. About 90% of the activities are directly 
organized  by associations  and independent  groups  who  use  the  venue.  Cascina 
Roccafranca’s social workers  are  also  involved  in  planning events  and  meetings 
but much of their work is dedicated to supporting groups in organising activities, 
especially  when  it  regards  younger  or  more  disadvantaged  groups  without 
experience.  The  programming  follows  closely  the  needs  of  the  community  and 
therefore,  many  events  and  activities  are  proposed  by  the  users  of  Cascina 
Roccafranca.  
“We imagine this place, and this project, as a container with spaces to fill. 
As operators, we monitor if activities correspond to the framework that we 
defined, the strategic goals we decided upon, the working conditions. But 
we  expect  the  groups  and  associations  to  fill  this  space  with  activities.” 
Renato Bergamin

Cascina Roccafranca accommodates about 195 cultural programs a year. These 
activities include music, theatre, conferences, book readings and roundtables with 
authors of books, language courses, cabaret, dance, even dance in a wheelchair 
for  disabled  people.  The  summer  program  is  usually  different  from  the  winter’s

schedule  as  it  features  more  outdoor  evening  festivals and  a summer  camp  for 
children on holidays, with a total of 40 programs.  
Besides  its  own  events,  Cascina  hosts  about  127 wellness  programs  and 
courses  proposed  by  external  organisations per  year.  These  are  weekly 
activities organized for a period of 4 months or a year. Some of them are free of 
charge for the participants and the organizers do not pay rent to Cascina either, 
while in others the participants pay a small annual fee to the instructor but in this 
case, the instructor also pays a small fee – 8 euros per hour – for the space.  
The complex hosts 7 regular educational activities per year:  an after-school 
run by volunteers to help students improve on their week school subjects and it 
targets elementary school students, middle school students, and until the first or 
max second year of high school; summer activities for  groups of 0-6  years  old 
children and for groups of 6-13 years old with  games, workshops, and excursions; 
support activities for children with physical or mental challenges.  
Cascina  Roccafranca  works  regularly  in  collaboration  with  two  cooperatives 
promoting  the integration  of  people  with  mental  disabilities: Mente  Locale 
(Local Mind) uses creative methods to address depression and eating disorders; 
Alzheimer Café  proposes meetings for people suffering from this disease and for 
their  families  as  well  as  organizes  informative  meetings  with  educators  and 
specialized doctors and physiologists.  
“We don't have particular limitations in terms of themes but we are open to 
what  people  are  interested,  if  they  are  willing  to  invest  in  it.  As  social 
operator, we help them by providing spaces, tools, and by connecting them 
with other groups or other organizations.” Stefania Ieluzzi 
Cascina Roccafranca hosts 355 private parties yearly. The Foundation has two 
rooms  which  can  be  used  on  Saturday  evening,  Sunday  afternoon  and  Friday 
evening giving space to an average of 4 parties every weekend. Other festivities 
are organised by the restaurant cooperative. Lastly, a cooperative managing the 
baby parking and the toy library sublets its rooms for children birthday parties as 
well.

8 The policy environment 
Mirafiori Nord and Cascina Roccafranca have been at the centre of a series of urban 
policies and funding programmes that enabled the Turin Municipality to design and 
implement a long-term regeneration strategy. In the late 1990s, in the midst of 
growing discussion about the problems of urban peripheries across Italy, but in 
lack of any national policy addressing the issue, the Turin Municipality launched 
the Progetto Speciale Periferie (PSP – Special Periphery Project).  
 
Progetto Speciale Periferie: Launched in 1997 by the Turin Municipality, PSP 
aimed to help the municipal administration to develop skills and capacities 
necessary to work with larger urban regeneration programmes. PSP focussed 
on Turin’s crisis areas in the peripheries, according to an incremental logic that 
facilitated local development and the active participation of local citizens. 
Another characteristic of the programme that it linked the territorial logic of 
the “neighbourhood” with a wider urban strategy of rethinking the city 
according to a polycentric model and building new centralities and identities at 
the peripheries.

Enabled  by  the  capacities  developed  in  PSP,  the  Turin  Municipality  could 
successfully mobilise resources from other funding sources as well. Since the early 
2000s,  the  Turin  Municipality’s  careful  use  of  URBAN  II  (2000-2006) and Urban 
Innovative Actions (2017-2020) resources allowed the city to articulate a coherent 
vision for the territory.   
 
The URBAN II programme’s 10.7 million euros funding included 6.2 million euros 
for  infrastructure  and  urban  rehabilitation,  2.5  million  euros  for  training  and 
economic development, 1.4 million euros for social development and integration, 
and 0.6 million euros for technical assistance. The intervention in Mirafiori included 
some  infrastructure  development  (the  requalification  of  some  squares  and  the 
introduction  of  door-to-door  recycling  collection),  economic  development  and 
training, as well as cultural and social activities. Renato Bergamin, the founder of 
Cascina  Roccafranca  was  responsible  for  some  of  these  cultural  and  social 
activities, and one of the actions funded by URBAN II was dedicated to the adaptive 
reuse of the Cascina Roccafranca and its transformation into a community venue.  
The URBAN II programme’s design included incentives to build local partnerships 
with community groups. Complying with this requirement, the Turin Municipality 
could rely on the Tavoli Sociali, the already existing participation  mechanism  in 
Mirafiori Nord, and refocus it towards a common specific goal, brainstorming on 
the possibilities of a new community venue. This phase of participatory planning 
lasted  about  2/3  years,  and  eventually  resulted  in  a  concept  for  the  Cascina 
Roccafranca.  
“Sometimes  we  underestimate  this  stage  of  engagement  with  regular 
citizens because we always take for granted that no good ideas would come 
up from it. But actually, in this case, there were few ideas that helped us. 
Paradoxically,  some  people  suggested  a  sort  of  shopping  centre  which 
seems absurd, but it was actually useful: we understood that we needed an 
attractive force  similar  to  the  one  of  the shopping  centre. Our  decision  to 
create a space for all citizens, from the younger to the older, and to have a 
wide branch of offers – some very simple for leisure and others more cultural 
– are the results of this idea.” Renato Bergamin  
Besides the participatory planning process, the last one and half years before the 
inauguration were spent to test some activities and launch the incubatore di idee 
(ideas incubator), inviting citizens to suggest ideas for activities to take place in 
the Cascina. 
URBAN II, the second round of the European Union’s URBAN Community 
Initiative supported 70 deprived urban areas across the EU in the period 2000-
2006. Discontinued in the following EU funding period, the URBAN programme, 
financed by the European Regional Development Fund, aimed at the “economic 
and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis in order to 
promote sustainable development” (European Commission). The programme 
provides funding for the renovation of buildings and public spaces, local 
employment, education and training for disadvantaged groups, 
environmentally friendly public transport development, more efficient energy 
management systems and the use of renewable energy.

8.1 Case del Quartiere 
As a result of the Progetto Speciale Periferie, participatory planning processes were 
undertaken in several neighbourhoods of Turin. These processes had a variety of 
results but in all of them there was an ambition to create a concrete outcome like 
a  space  that  could  collect  initiatives,  and  give  a  structure  and  continuity  to 
participation.  The  spaces  created  through  these  processes,  although  they  had 
different trajectories, had many similarities as well. At some point, these spaces 
began  to  connect  to  each  other  and  began  to  identify  themselves  as  Case  del 
Quartiere  (Neighbourhood  Houses).  More  developed  than  other  Houses,  the 
Cascina Roccafranca was defined as a model for the Case del Quartiere.  
“We  realized  that  different  single  programs  of  urban  regeneration  in 
different  neighbourhoods  with  different  stories,  different  characteristics, 
different financial tools, different operational tools shared the same goal of 
creating a space for informal socialization and service provision.” Giovanni 
Ferrero 
 
 
 
In 2012, after the Turin Municipality and the Compagnia di San Paolo, the city’s 
most powerful bank foundation, began to recognise the importance of the Case del 
Quartiere,  and  encouraged  them  to  build  a  network. From  May  2012,  the  8 
Neighbourhood Houses in Turin established an informal coordination platform that 
favour the organization of common projects. Its first milestone was winning the 
national grant Che Fare? (What shall we do?) in 2014 which provided the economic 
resources for regular meetings. Following the publication of a manifesto in 2015, 
the Coordination of the Neighbourhood Houses was eventually transformed in 2017 
into a formal Rete delle Case del Quartiere (Network of Neighbourhood Houses), 
in  the  form  of  an Associazione  di  Promozione  Sociale (an  Association  for  Social 
Promotion).   
“One of this association's goal is to make the Case del Quartiere model a 
political  choice  that  influences  city  policies.  We  have  already  started  a 
dialogue with the administration so that we can make this become a Turin 
policy.” Renato Bergamin 
The Network’s goal is to support the work of the Case del Quartiere by gathering 
information,  managing internal  communication  and  to  discover  and  suggest 
potential  areas  of  intervention. The  Rete  delle  Case  del  Quartiere has  monthly 
executive  meetings with one representative from each 8 houses and it has two 
annual  assemblies:  in  Spring  to  monitor  the  activities  of  the  Houses  and  to 
Case del Quartiere: In Turin there are 8 Case del Quartiere (Neighbourhood 
Houses). These are community spaces that offer citizens opportunities to meet 
through cultural events, social encounters and self-produced workshops. They 
are managed by a team that collects proposals from external organisations 
(associations, third sector organizations, social enterprises, committees, 
groups, individual citizens) to develop a rich program of activities using the 
spaces of the Houses. The Neighbourhood Houses work in collaboration the city 
council and they also collect proposals from citizens within the Co-City 
program.

evaluate their resource-efficiency, and in Autumn to dig deeper in the themes on 
which the Houses work. The Network has two offices managed by two part-time 
employees: an office for internal coordination and a communications office.  
“The network enables discussions for coordination, at a practical level, and 
for the management, at a political level. This gives awareness not just about 
what   we   do   but   also   about   the   consequences   our   projects   have.”

8.2 Regulation of the Urban Commons and Co-City 
The Case del Quartiere model, based on an experimental cooperation between the 
Turin  Municipality  and  local  civic  actors,  has  opened  a  new  way  for  public-civic 
cooperation. The network has informed the local discussion about the commons, 
and its experience contributed to the design of Turin’s version of the Regulation of 
the Urban Commons, approved in January 2016. The regulation establishes new 
forms  of  cooperation  between  citizens  and  the  local  authority  for  the  care,  the 
shared management and the regeneration of urban commons.  
 
The Regulation of the Commons: Urban commons present the opportunity 
for citizens to gain power in the management of urban resources and reframe 
city life based on the use value of public and community assets, rather than 
their exchange value. In the last decade, municipalities across Italy have been 
starting to develop regulations that allow the co-management of common 
goods at a local level, recognizing the active role of citizens in using, 
administering, maintaining and organising public spaces, buildings or natural 
areas. Different versions of Urban Commons Regulations have been approved 
in hundreds of Italian cities.

The Regulation of Urban Commons in Turin provides tools for a formal collaboration 
between citizens and administration in running community venues. Specifically, by 
signing the Pact of Collaboration (the main instrument introduced by the Commons 
Regulation),  the  Municipality  and  active  citizens  (such  as  informal  groups, 
associations, NGOs or individuals) agree to share responsibility in managing and 
intervening in various urban spaces. Enabled by the Regulation, the Municipality 
gathers proposals submitted by citizens and opens public consultations to identify 
urban common assets to include in pacts of collaboration. 
Urban commons are at the centre of the Co-City project, developed by the Turin 
Municipality  with  support  of  the  European  Union’s Urban  Innovative  Actions 
programme. Co-City aims at bringing the Regulation of the Urban Commons to a 
higher  level,  reducing  urban  poverty  with  the  help  of  new  social  enterprises 
organised  around  commons-based  welfare  services and  activities.  Co-City  also 
envisioned  to  establish  a  new  Casa  del  Quartiere,  recognising  the  model  as  a 
uniquely efficient means for citizen involvement and neighbourhood work.  
The  Case  del  Quartiere  are  spread  across  Turin  and  they  rely  on  district-level 
networks  that makes  them  an important  partner  for  the  Municipality  to develop 
locally rooted projects. The governance of the Case del Quartiere is similar to the 
collaboration  pacts  proposed  by  the  Commons  Regulation.  They  also  share  the 
goals of creating spaces for the co-production of welfare services and developing 
tools  to  address  urban  decay  and  the  fragility  of  peripheral  areas,  by  inviting 
citizens and neighbourhood communities to participate at the decision-making.  
The  Rete  delle  Case  del  Quartiere  is  a  key  partner  of  Co-City,  mobilising  its 
experience  in  generating  public-civic cooperation in social inclusion and poverty 
mitigation as well as in reusing abandoned buildings for socio-cultural initiatives. 
Having  the  most  important  financial  capacity  among  the  8  Houses,  Cascina 
Roccafranca became the representative of the Network for Co-City and it provides 
the  rest  of  the  network  with  legal  infrastructure  to  manage  financial  and 
administration.  
“One  of  the  goals  of  Co-City  is  to  find  solutions  to the  growing  urban 
complexity.  This  area- and  people-based  approach  on  a  local  scale  can 
strengthen support networks, opportunities of empowerment, but it doesn't 
affect the structural elements that produce the social and economic crisis in 
the city. Most of the social frailty are structural such as unemployment on 
which projects as ours cannot have a broad impact.” Giovanni Ferrero 
9 Governance 
The  buildings  of  Cascina  Roccafranca  are  owned  by  the  Turin  Municipality.  The 
Municipality  assigned  the  venue  to  the  Cascina  Roccafranca  Foundation  that 
manages it jointly with the municipality and district representatives. As a public 
asset,  Cascina  Roccafranca’s  use  is  limited  to  social  and  cultural  purposes, 
preventing commercial activities.  
Cascina Roccafranca is managed by the Fondazione atipica in partecipazione 
Cascina  Roccafranca (Cascina  Roccafranca  atypical  participated  foundation), 
legally established  in  2006.  This  foundation  works  with  a  model  between  public 
and private law: in some aspects it depends on public procedures and for others it 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Cascina Roccafranca Observatory Case 
21 
 
works  as  a  private  organisation.  As  a  legal  entity,  Cascina  Roccafranca  has  to 
respect public procedures when it comes to subcontracting, purchasing goods or 
services and has to follow the regulations on corruption prevention and privacy. At 
the  same  time,  it  is  a  flexible  entity  and  it  can  hire  external  contractors  and 
freelancers if it needs specific expertise. Cascina Roccafranca’s status as a public-
private  foundation  is  an  experiment,  an  attempt  of  close  collaboration  with  the 
Turin  Municipality  and  after  more  than  ten  years,  it  is  generally  conceived  as  a 
virtuous collaboration. 
“This  form  of  governance  created  a  positive  form  of  co-responsibility 
between public and private actors: the administration gave up some of its 
powers,  and  on  the  other  hand,  the  private  associations'  mindset  shifted 
from an idea of claiming something from the administration to a perspective 
in which they co-manage it.” Renato Bergamin 
The foundation’s governance structure consists of a Board of Directors with 5 
members: 3 of which are nominated by the Municipality (the Councillor for 
integration policies, the President of the District and one member appointed by 
the District) and 2 members appointed by the College of Participants (made by 
45 associations and groups that operate in the Cascina). The College of 
Participants meets every six months and nominates its representatives who 
attend the Board of Directors. This latter meets once a month and it decides on 
some activities and dilemmas the foundation is facing. 
“What happens here is not actually decided by the Board of Directors. The 
Board  mentors,  monitors  and  verifies  because  all  the  activities  performed 
here   are   the   result   of   the   suggestions   and   the   ideas   coming   from 
associations or groups.” Renato Bergamin 
10 Economic model 
The  foundation  is  autonomous  in  its  financial  management  and  it  has  its  own 
financial report, besides its institutional report towards the Municipality. It differs 
from  classical  foundations  as  it  relies  on  more  than  material  assets  (funds, 
buildings,   etc.),   proposing,   instead,   a   joint   management   by   the   public 
administration  and  various informal  groups.  The  foundation  works  with  over  80 
associations and informal groups, as well as 20 individuals who promote activities 
in the venue. They all contribute to the foundation with their intangible heritage 
as  associations, groups  and  private  citizens  but  not  economically.  In  particular, 
they invest their competences and knowledge, as well as their ideas and time to 
the Cascina’s operations.  
The  Turin  Municipality,  as  the  owner  of  Cascina,  is  the  founding  member  of 
Fondazione   Cascina   Roccafranca.   The   municipality   has   contributed   to   the 
foundation’s  work  in  a  variety  of  ways:  it  provided  a  physical  asset,  giving the 
building in use, free of charge, to the foundation; and it covers a part of the costs 
of its services. Some of the Cascina’s employees are on the municipality’s payroll, 
the municipality gave a part of the venue’s original furniture and covers most of 
the maintenance work costs. It also manages some of the office's utilities where 
Cascina’s employees work, while other utilities are paid by the entities using the 
rooms (the cafeteria, and the restaurant).

Besides  the  7  employees  that  are  directly  paid  by the  municipality,  Cascina 
Roccafranca’s yearly expenses amount to around 200-250,000 euros. The biggest 
part  of  this  expense  is  constituted  by  the  wages  of  the  foundation’s  7  own 
employees, adding up to around 95,000 euros. Around 20,000 euros are paid out 
in taxes and other charges. The cost of complying with safety regulations as well 
as organising services and events amounts to around 76,000 euros.  
Cascina  Roccafranca’s  yearly  revenues  amount  to  about  250,000  euros.    The 
foundation format simplifies Cascina's management and it enables it to generate 
revenues through its spaces and activities. Selected a through a public call, 
the cooperative managing the café and the restaurant pay a fixed rent of about 
58,000 euros a year. Another revenue stream, about 60,000 euros a year, comes 
from the use of other spaces by social or private entities. Some of them long-term 
activities are courses; for example, the English course is open to people who pay 
about 130 euros a year and the association providing the course pays a low hourly 
rent  to  the  foundation.  Cascina  also  rents  space  for  private  events  such  as 
graduations or birthday parties: in 2018, Cascina Roccafranca hosted about 355 
private  parties,  with  an  average  of  4  parties  every  weekend.  Private  support 
through  self-financing  events  and  fundraising  activities  like  the  occasional 
campaign  1000  amici  per  la  Cascina  Roccafranca  (1000  friends  for  Cascina 
Roccafranca) brings in about 30,000 euros. Sponsors who pay for specific activities 
contribute  with  around  6,000  euros  and  other  grants  cover  another  10-15,000 
euros.  The  Cascina’s  biggest  sponsor,  Compagnia  di  San  Paolo  contributes  with 
around 80,000 euros yearly.  
“We aim at reaching maximum self-sustainability. When we started in 
2007 we could only cover 33% of our costs on our own, now we cover 
66%. Besides our income from commercial activities and space rental, we 
do fundraising with public and private foundations and develop economic 
partnerships with the private sector on joint projects.” Stefania de Masi  
Cascina Roccafranca’s economy goes beyond the foundation’s own revenues and 
expenses. According to data from 2017, Cascina Roccafranca’s partners (mostly 
users of its spaces) have generated about 770,000 euros worth of economic 
value.  
11 Impact 
Cascina Roccafranca’s impact is realised at a variety of levels. At the level of the 
neighbourhood,  the  foundation  invests  a  significant  amount  of  energy  to  better 
understand its reception and impact on the territory. Cascina  Roccafranca 
periodically  surveys  the  community’s  reception  of  the  organisations,  and  it 
regularly  invites  members  and  participants  to  public  assemblies  to  evaluate 
ongoing projects and to discuss possible improvements. For example, the project 
La  Cascina  si  ripensa  (The  Cascina  rethinks  itself)  called  Cascina’s  members  to 
evaluate  its  work  over  the  year.    As  part  of  the  Rete  delle  Case  del  Quartiere, 
Cascina Roccafranca regularly evaluates it social impact collecting data of people 
entering the premises, activities, events, the state of its partner associations, its 
economic revenue.  
According  to  data  collected  2017,  Cascina  works  with  178  partners,  including 
associations,  informal  groups,  social enterprises,  committees  and  individual

citizens.  In a  year,  Cascina accommodated  766  activities, of  which  195  cultural 
events, 127 well-being activities and courses, 351 private festivities. Only 10% of 
activities  are  directly  managed  by  the  Cascina,  the other  90%  of  events  are 
organised by partners. In terms of the hours spent in Cascina, 85% of the time is 
used by regular, stable partners. 50% of the activities are for free, 34% have fees 
that  cover  the  event’s  costs,  13%  of  events  with  subsidised  fees  and  3%  with 
individualised prices. In 2017, 480 volunteers contributed with over 15000 hours 
of work, as an equivalent of 11 full-time employees.  
On  the  user  side,  Cascina  Roccafranca  registered  over  160,000  single  entries  in 
2017,  with  4000  people  inscribed  for  courses  and  other  activities.  Most  of  the 
Cascina’s  public  comes  from  Mirafiori  Nord  (53%),  with  another  22%  from  the 
district Circoscrizione 2, 19% from Turin and 6% from outside. The largest user 
group is between 26-64 years (44%), with 26% over 65, 25% under 14 and only 
5% between 15-25.  
By conducting its programme and hosting a variety of activities, Cascina creates 
a  variety of jobs. The Foundation itself employs 7 administrative staff paid by 
the municipality and 7 staff paid by the foundation. According to data from 2017, 
all the organisations on the site together employed around 141 people, with hours 
equivalent of 38 full-time employees.  
 
Some of the activities in Cascina Roccafranca are provided by social cooperatives, 
selected  through  inclusive  procurement  that  aims  at  creating  significant  social 
impact through the choice of partners or service providers. Cooperativa Raggio, 
the cooperative managing the restaurant and the cafeteria gives work to 25 people 
among partners and part-time employees.  
The  Cascina  also  helps  the  creation  of  new  social  enterprises.  The Cooperativa 
Educazione Progetto, a cooperative running children’s activities, received 50,000 
funding to start up their business, before becoming autonomous. The baby parking 
service requires a fee, this gives the cooperative revenue, while the municipality 
pays for the playground, so none of their activities rely on the Cascina’s financial 
support. The cooperative now employs 7 part-time staff.  
„We invested in the first effort, the cooperative that manages these baby 
areas does the rest. They are doing an excellent job and believe in our 
mission, they are active participants in the discussion on our centre. We 
don’t have a typical customer/contractor relationship as we choose a 
collaborative approach and we think it’s the only way to make things 
work.” Stefania de Masi  
A social cooperative-run restaurant: The restaurant and the cafeteria inside 
Cascina Roccafranca are run by Cooperative Raggio, a B-type social cooperative 
that hires staff with physical and/or psychological disabilities. The cooperative 
was selected through a call for tenders, Cascina Roccafranca provided the space 
and the equipment, the restaurant only needs to pay rent. Cooperative Raggio 
employs  9  full-time  partners,  and  12-20  part-time  employees.  In  2018, 16  of 
these  employees  belonged  to  weaker  social  categories,  their  employment  is 
subsidised.

The Cascina is also a carrier of local memory and heritage. It hosts the Centro 
Interpretazione  e  Documentazione  Storica  (Local  History  Interpretation  and 
Documentation  Centre)  of  the  Circoscrizione  2,  the  district  surrounding  Cascina 
Roccafranca. This  centre  is  conceived as  an  Ecomuseum,  that is,  a  place  where 
local historical memories are archived and made accessible to citizens. 
 
At the level of the city, the organisation had a strong impact on public 
policies, inspiring the creation of other Neighbourhood Houses and serving a 
model for the Rete delle Case del Quartiere. Its success served as a proof that 
new forms of the public-civic co-management of spaces are possible in Turin and 
beyond. Cascina Roccafranca’s model also informed the city’s Regulation of 
Urban Commons and the organisation’s support was fundamental for the city to 
obtain EU funding for urban regeneration projects. 
“Although the Commons Regulation didn't exist at the time, many of its 
concepts were already experimented in Cascina Roccafranca in its form of 
public-civic cooperation. Its model of long-term participation, not limited 
to decision-making related to the realisation of a project inspired a new 
way of structuring urban environments and the relations among people in 
the long term.” Giovanni Ferrero

An Ecomuseum is a structure to enable local communities to take care of their 
territories. Ecomuseums function as collections of local knowledge and memory 
as  well  as  an  effort  to  valorise  local  environmental,  historical  and  artistic 
heritage.  Museums  on  a 1:1  scale  without  walls,  Ecomuseums  usually  cover 
entire areas and promote opportunities to learn about an area’s history and get 
involved in its present. In Italy, from the early 2000s, a variety of laws support 
the  creation  of  “diffused”  museums,  Piemonte  being  the  first  region  to  adapt 
such law.

1 Introduction 
The Scugnizzo Liberato is one of the bottom-up experiments formally recognized 
by the Municipality of Naples as part of their broader strategy of heritage 
development. The focus of this strategy is to give value to common goods and 
reinterpret the traditional legal institute of the “civic use” (uso civico). It is 
located in the seventeenth-century complex of San Francesco delle Cappuccinelle 
in the heart of the historic city centre of Naples. The Scugnizzo Liberato 
experiment started on September 29
th
 2015 when it was squatted by the Scacco 
Matto organization. Recognized as a common good of the city, it is currently 
considered to be a place of congregation and socializing as well as an experiment 
of urban regeneration.

3 The history of the building 
In 1585, the San Francesco delle Cappuccinelle convent was founded by Duchess 
Eleonora Scarpato, widow of the notary and Duke Luca Giglio. She financed the 
construction of a small church and a shelter for young women in her house, with 
the  aim  of thanking  Assisi  Saint  to  whom  she  believes  healed  her.  The 
Cappuccinelle shelter and convent became so frequently used that, in 1613, it was 
necessary to enlarge the space due to the growing number of inhabitants. For this 
reason, the Giglio-Scarpato’s property extended to the nearby De Mari building. In 
the  first  decades  of  the  17
th
 century,  the  monastery  was  transformed  into  a 
cloistered  convent
1
.  New  properties  were  acquired  up  until  1712,  when  the 
complex  was  reshaped  into  baroque  forms  by  the  architect Giovan  Battista 
Nuclerio,  who  carried  out  the  renovation  of  the  church.  The  same  architect 
constructed the dome and the bell tower, which have been both demolished for 
safety  reasons  post-World  War  II.  Between  1746  and  1748  a  new  workshop,  a 
furnace,  a  cellar,  a  cistern,  a refectory  with  kitchen  and  a  mill with  a  new  barn 
were  built.  In  the  same  period,  an  infirmary  was  added  in  a  new  area  of  the 
monastery as well as two belvederes, one covered and the other uncovered. The 
latter is still clearly visible from the street as a result of aerial arches that were 
designed between the 1600s and 1700s by the architect Cosimo Fanzago

 Other interventions between 1756 and 1760 are to be attributed to the work of architect Niccolò Tagliacozzi 
Canale who carried out some transformations in stucco and marble, for example of the church façade and of the 
front door.

3
.  
 
The first significant renovation to the building was made in 1809 which was ordered 
by Gioacchino Murat during the French control of the South of Italy
4
. In the same 
year, it was decided to suppress the monastery and to convert it into a juvenile 
detention  centre,  named  Filangieri  Institute  after  Gaetano  Filangieri,  a  famous 
Neapolitan  jurist.  Although  the  institute  changed  its  name  several  times
5
,  it 
continued  to  be  a  juvenile  detention  centre into  the  following  century. As  a 
consequence of a destructive earthquake happened in Naples in 1980
6
, the building 
was severely damaged  and  thus abandoned. Hence,  the  complex  underwent 
several changes, including the construction of the apartments for the director and 
his officers, who will play a big part in the internal construction of the building. In 
order to achieve the abovementioned conversion of the building, it was crucial – 
and to some extent still is - to support and commitment of Eduardo De Filippo
7
. In 
1985,  after  becoming  a  senator  of  the  Italian  Republic,  he  financed  the 
construction  of  a theatre  within  the  Filangieri  Institute; the  purpose was  to 
transform a place of detention into a social and cultural space. “Eduardo’s dream”, 
as it is still remembered
8
, embraced an overall rethinking of the former prison and 
it gave an essential push towards the development of the building. His objective 
was to give a different purpose to the complex by transforming it into a recovery 
centre based on craft labs, rehabilitation and educational activities. However, the 
project failed and remained incomplete. In 2006, the so-called “Eduardo regional 
law”
9
 “Interventions in support of improving youths living condition in Campania", 
was  no  longer  financed.  Nevertheless,  in  1999,  a  further  restoration  project – 
promoted by De Filippo – was concluded and the building was transformed into a 
Day-time Multifunctional Centre (Centro polifunzionale diurno). 
 
“I spent about one year in the Filangieri Institute. I am still very grateful to 
Eduardo De Filippo who supported the renovation of the theatre. Thanks to him, 
we had the possibility to leave our cells, and experience different activities. 
Before that, we were locked in our cells 24/7. Just getting out of there was so 
important for us.” Vincenzo Vidone

 During the fascist dictatorship (1925 – 1930) it was called Juvenile observation institute (Istituto di osservazione 
minorile) while between WWII post-war and the late Seventies (1945-1980), it was called Rehabilitation Institute 
(Istituto di rieducazione). Although the specific name underwent some changes, when it was a juvenile detention 
centre it was almost always called the Filangieri Institute.

In  2000,  the  Filangieri  Institute  was  purchased
10
 by  the  University  of  Naples 
Parthenope  in  order  to  use  the  complex  for  academic  purposes  (Scala,  2018). 
However,  after  six  years,  only  the  consolidation  of  the areal  arches  of  the 
uncovered belvedere was carried out whereas the structure itself went through 15 
years of abandonment. 
Meanwhile,  the  complex – such  us  many  other  Neapolitan  cultural  assets 
(Montanari,  2013) – was  robbed  of  its  more  precious  materials  (e.g.  gold  and 
church decorations, metal cell bars, etc.), and it was then informally occupied by 
local citizens. Moreover, a part of the complex was also used as a branch of the 
local  high  school  over  a time period. In  2014,  the  Municipality  acquired  the 
property  on  the  base  of  a valorization agreement  as  regulated  by  the  “Cultural 
Federal Agreement” (Federalismo Culturale, art. 5 (5) of dlgs.85/2010)11. 
Finally, in 2015, the Scacco Matto12 organization re-opened the structure with a 
different name: Scugnizzo Liberato. Few months later, the Municipality of Naples 
recognised the Scugnizzo Liberato as “an emerging common” (bene comune

emergente) through the Municipal Council Resolution no. 446 of 
2016. Since then, it has been part of a network of disused public assets, known 
as Common goods of Naples Municipality (Beni comuni della città di Napoli). 
4 The initiative 
 
“The Scugnizzo Liberato shows that despite there being many abandoned spaces 
in Naples they are still able to add to the vitality of the city. A sort of pride is 
hidden behind the people who are engaged in the transforming this ancient place 
into a collective one. It is a way to take back what was, and has always been, 
ours. Scugnizzi
13
  are  those rebels who aim to free Naples from everything that 
is choking its potential. Scugnizzi do not need prisons but alternatives to become 
new partisans of the community’s needs and wishes.” Cristiano Ferraro  
 
On September 29
th
 2015, a symbolic date for the city of Naples
14
, the activists of 
the Scacco Matto group, with the support of local citizens, re-opened the former 
convent launching the Scugnizzo Liberato. The initial phase of the new life of the 
building was characterized by initiatives which reclaimed the value of this asset. 
Showing – along with other urban commons of the city - to what extent social and 
political  activists’  actions  assume  a  proactive  role  in  the  heritage  regeneration 
processes (Gargiuolo and Cirulli, 2017). The main purpose of the occupation is “to 
fulfil Eduardo’s dream”, namely overcoming the stigmatization which affected 
the structure over the Centuries. 
“It was in the dream of Eduardo De Filippo to turn the convent into a daily multi-
functional centre where different kinds of courses and craft labs can be hosted. 
Therefore, the goal was to create a shared knowledge, and we stay put in this 
endeavour.” Cristiano Ferraro 
The project ultimately aims at redeeming the figure of the scugnizzo itself. The 
term scugnizzo is usually used to indicate young men who have committed crimes 
and  are  confined  in  a  specific  neighbourhood,  due  to  this  they  lack  a concrete 
chance to go beyond its physical and social boundaries. Giving the ex-convent a 
new  identity  as  Scugnizzo  Liberato,  which  literally  means  “released  Scugnizzo”, 
represents  a  symbolic  way  to  relieve  new  and  old scugnizzi from  this  kind  of 
burden. These reasons thus make the Scugnizzo Liberato a public space, managed 
independently  by  a  community  which  rejects  any  form  of  "fascism,  sexism, 
discrimination and abuse”
 15
.  
 
                                       
13
 The term scugnizzo comes from the Neapolitan dialect and it indicates a lively and smart street-boy who is 
used to rely on poorly honest expedients. The term is known and adopted throughout Italy.   
14
 It is the anniversary of the “Four Days of Naples” (Le quattro giornate di Napoli), a historical popular insurrection 
occurred  during  the  WWII, between  September  27
th
 and  30
th
 1943.  Civilians,  with  the  contribution  of  soldiers 
loyal to the Southern Kingdom, released the city of Naples from the occupation of Wehrmacht forces, assisted by 
groups of local fascists. Therefore, this day was chosen to recall and represent an important moment of resistance 
in the city. 
15
 These are constitutionally oriented principles that belongs to all experiments enabled by the Municipality of 
Naples.

The Scugnizzo Liberato shows how Eduardo de Filippo’s contribution – tangible and 
intangible – as a well-known patron  was  decisive  for the future of the  following 
experiment.  Eduardo’s  status  as  an  icon  of  Neapolitan  popular  culture  has 
constituted a kind of “brand image” for the project. His vision has been influencing 
the regeneration project, still impacting and guiding its current development. This 
evidence shows to what extend a “cultural leadership” is also a crucial element of 
successful participative  process.  Looking  at  the  Scugnizzo,  suggesting valuable 
visions and rising  the  community  awareness regarding  the  potential  of  the 
Cappuccinelle (people and buildings) is the most significant legacy of Eduardo. 
 
 
 
The word scugnizzo comes from Neapolitan popular usage and generally indicates 
a  lively  and  smart  street  child  who  is  used  to  scraping  a  living  by  not  entirely 
honest means. The term was used for the first time around the end of the 19th 
century  by  Ferdinando  Russo,  a  Neapolitan  poet  and  journalist.  In  1887  he 
composed a collection of sonnets called “E’ Scugnizze” in which he talked about 
everyday life in Naples, including street children whose presence was typical part 
of the urban landscape (De Blasi, 2006). As De Blasi (2006) underlined, Russo’s 
point of view was influenced by other Italian and European literary works such as 
La  Ginevra  by  Antonio  Ranieri  and  Oliver  Twist  by  Charles  Dickens. Therefore, 
these works increased the attention paid to the underworld of children living in the 
street without any practical support. As a result, the concept of scugnizzo was

popularized and adopted throughout Italy, although different words were used in 
different areas. Scugnizzo Liberato – which literally means “released scugnizzo” – 
aims  at  liberating  old  and  new scugnizzi from  this  condition,  which  is  still  very 
common  in  the  working-class  districts  of  Naples.  Thus,  naming  the  project 
Scugnizzo  Liberato, the community want to shed a light on how, in this kind of 
context, reusing and regenerating a heritage building could encourage the caring 
of the most vulnerable residents of the city. 
5 Influences 
Two concepts assumed a crucial role in the Scugnizzo Liberato project: the mutual 
support and the “do it yourself” (DIY) practices as basis for collective living. The 
Scugnizzo  community  supports  the  culture  of  mutuality,  as  a  universal  value 
inherent in the everyday life of the community itself, promoting social cohesion 
and  inclusion.  Such  aspects,  it  has  to  be  noticed,  concern  all  those  Neapolitan 
experiences which aim at strengthening the capacities of the most fragile subjects 
of  the  city. Self-recovery  and  collective  care  of  the  space  represent  the 
cornerstones of “civic use” (uso civico) practices. By recovering the history of the 
place,  they  practically support  and  reshape  the  collective  imaginary  and  “in-
common”  narrative.  This  is  considered  a  starting  point  for  the  participatory 
evolution of the project, as well as the primary mission of an authentic collective 
interest

6 Buildings and complex description 
The  main  entrance  of  the  Scugnizzo  Liberato  complex  is  located  at Salita 
Pontecorvo n°46 which leads to a rectangular plan around a squared courtyard. 
The complex is surrounded by a high wall, visible from Vico Lungo Pontecorvo, a 
small alley that follows the south-east side and the back of the area. The convent 
surface measures about 10.000 sqm, distributed across 6 levels, one of which is a 
half-ground floor

 Since the complex develops on a steep hill side, the ground floor is in part above the ground and in part below 
it. For the distribution of all functions see: Activities.

It is important to notice that the difficulties in managing such a large complex were 
one of the main reasons behind the dissolution of the Scacco Matto organization
18
. 
Two external courtyards located on different levels make up the ground floor. The 
smaller one can be reached straight from the main entrance, while the second one 
is on the highest level. Both courtyards are divided by a pedestrian corridor that 
leads to their respective entrances. Two bassi
19
, located on both sides of the main 
entrance,  are  currently used as residences and two apartments of different size 
are located on the half-ground floor. On the first floor there is a wide gallery with 
high naves and barrel vaults. The gallery surrounds the whole perimeter of both 
yards and other spaces: a small theatre, a gym, creative labs, study rooms and 
toilets.

 The basso is a ground level house constituted by one, or less frequently two, rooms, facing the street where 
it often extends through unauthorized (temporary or not) installations. It is a multifunctional space with no rigid 
partitions or functional areas, seamlessly connected to the public space.

The entrance to the church, currently not accessible, is located on 
the first floor too; it has a main nave supported by four pairs of columns and it 
measures around 400sqm.  
 
 
The second floor is made up of modular offices, classrooms and living areas. The 
living areas, former detention facilities, consist of a series of rooms with a toilet. 
Whilst  few  of  the  rooms  have  been  repaired  (a  drawing-creative  lab  called 
disegnatoio,  and  some  rooms  employed  as  warehouses).  The  main  part  of  this 
floor is perishing. Although it has no offices, the third floor is comparable to the 
second one, as it hosts a similar number of living spaces and classrooms. Wide 
hallways cover the entire perimeter and balconies define the outdoors. Such as the 
second floor, it lies in a state of abandonment. As Giaccio explains: 
“This is one of the rooms that still shows its original shape: the small domed 
vault, once fully frescoed. The one still visible depicts the Madonna Veronica with 
a veil showing an image of Christ’s face. Humidity is wearing it off; in fact, it is 
destroying everything. See that spot on the shoulder of the Madonna? It is 
constantly growing. Ah, and do you see the angel over there? When it rains, it 
looks like he has tears in his eyes!” Giaccio

The surface of the fourth floor is around half of the total size of the complex and 
its height has been increased. The floor hosts mainly classrooms that run along 
the courtyard perimeter. The fourth floor is in the same state as the previous ones. 
The long-lasting state of neglect determined the poor preservation of the convent, 
recently certified by a technical-estimative  evaluation  carried  out  by  the  Naples 
Municipal Offices.

7 Adaptive re-use 
Along the centuries, the layout of the convent (1500-1700) underwent significant 
transformations  that  affected  the  façades  and  increased  the  number  of  floors.  
Thus, it is in a continuous process of adaptation, at the end of which the Scugnizzo 
Liberato project will be the most recent intervention. The adaptive re-use of the 
Cappuccinelle convent is at the very core of the complex social and political process 
which  motivates  the group.  Before  2015,  the  Scacco  Matto  group  founded  its 
political  activity  on  an  abandoned  spaces  recovery  campaign, striving  for  social 
participation. The re-use project is reclaiming the complex through a spatial justice 
prospective. The starting point for the Scugnizzo community “civic use” (uso civico) 
has been through self- recovery operations that they consider are a basic tool for 
collective living. It has been argued that inhabiting and taking care of the space 
(or, on a broader scale, of the city), is part of a legitimization process which creates 
a “right” to decide the use of the spaces. This kind of reuse thus constitutes an 
incremental  project  based  on  small  steps
20
 and,  mainly,  on  self-organization  / 
building.  Currently,  the  ground  and  the  first floor  have  been  made  accessible 
through a series of ongoing interventions, periodically planned and verified by the 
Scugnizzo management assembly (assemblea di gestione)
21
. Among its objectives, 
the  assembly  aims  to  carry  out  the  restoration  through  initiatives  which  should 
generate  multiple  ripple  effects.  The  gathering  of  the  communities  around  the 
spaces is part of the progressive reactivation. As activists recall, when the complex 
was first occupied, it was inaccessible due to widespread mould and vegetation. 
However,   restoration   works   between   the   80s   and   90s,   in   particular   the 
construction of the theatre and the gym, provided important anchoring points for 
the reuse project. 
“The building started to be restored, especially in the first period, thanks to 
people’s efforts. When we arrived to the convent it was traumatic: both courts 
were completely covered with grass and trees that were rooted up to the internal 
rooms of the complex. In addition, the condition of the church clearly showed 
that many assets were plundered.” Gaetano Quattromani 
Therefore, the initial works focused on minimal operations to ensure the safety of 
the complex
22
, allowing the use of some spaces. When the Scugnizzo Liberato was 
formally recognized by the Municipality of Naples, an official collaboration began. 
Then, restoration practices were aligned with safety and usability regulations. It is 
relevant to underline that the recognition of the ex-Cappuccinelle had been taking 
place in context of severe economic austerity, due to the pre-bankruptcy state of

 Since the informal phase lasted several months, this was developed without the technical opinion of the 
municipality. The evaluation process, thus, consisted in an informal technical consultancy based on 
community’s expertise.

the Municipality
23
. Although   managerial   costs   are   partially 
remitted to the public authority
24
, economic difficulties emerged, for instance, the 
disposal of the large amounts of construction waste as well as in ordinary repairing 
techniques
25
. As Fabrizio Vitali states:  
“These issues have been solved - and still are – following the “Neapolitan style”: 
effectively connecting people towards a common goal. In this perspective, 
maintaining an informal relationship with the public authority is also essential. 
We advance our requests by calling councillors and assessors. We can say that 
the most effective method to communicate with the administration remains the 
direct one.” Fabrizio Vitali  
The maintenance of the building has been ensured through a sort of public-private-
people collaboration, evaluating the available social and territorial capital. Hence, 
methods and objectives are negotiated through interventions based on a strong 
interdisciplinary  approach  and  with  available  resources. Moreover,  one  or  more 
public officials of the administration are directly engaged in the project, in order 
to ensure a permanent contact between the community and the municipality and 
to  avoid  time-consuming  processes.Overall,  interventions  of  the  complex have 
been made on one hand because of personal commitment from the community of 
inhabitants  and  on  the  other  hand  thanks  to  the  support  of  the  public 
administration. Up until now they consisted of: 
• Securing the complex in light of the assessment of the overall structure 
run in accordance with the law. Consequently, the closure of the church 
and of the prison director’s house have been decided; 
• Ordinary maintenance works such as: waterproofing the roof without 
alteration of the original characteristics; interventions for plasters, painting 
and interior coatings; electrical and water systems adaptation; repairing of 
the sewer system; door installations; 
• Extraordinary maintenance works such as: moving or adding partition 
walls to create an open space bar area; paving and finishing work; 
construction of a soundproofing system for the theatre; 
• Integration and recovery of furniture to design outdoor and indoor areas. 
 
 
8 Context 
The Scugnizzo Liberato is situated in the historical area of the city and it includes 
some of the most important squares and main streets of the city: on one side, 
                                       
23
 In 2013, the Naples City Council declared pre-bankruptcy, namely an interim phase during which it is 
recognized the financial crisis of the PA, but it is still reversible. Since that, it has opened up a multiannual 
procedure that aims at restoring the debt of the Municipalities by including the State’s participation.

Piazza Dante and via Toledo and, on the other, via Salvator Rosa 
and Corso Vittorio Emanuele. This area can be accessed by public transportation 
that  can  be  easily  reached  from  the  Cappuccinelle  ex-convent.  Conversely,  the 
Cappuccinelle area is hardly accessible by cars due to the high urban density and 
the  narrowness  of  the  alleys. Specifically, located  in  the  Avvocata  area,  the 
Scugnizzo   Liberato   is   in   the   second   municipality   of   the   city,   along   with 
Montecalvario, Mercato, Pendino, Porto, San Giuseppe. As part of the city centre 
of Naples, the area has acquired urban relevance due to its historical character. 
Avvocata,  commonly  known  as  “Pignasecca”,  is  characterized  by  a texture of 
narrow streets and ancient buildings dated back to the 1700s. Its tuff artefacts, 
inner  openings,  street  markets  and  many  minor  artworks  make  it  a  tourist 
destination. As  it  is  well-known,  the  historical  centre  of  Naples  is  still  densely 
populated
26
. In 2016, the population of the II Municipality was about 10% (98.337) 
of the total population of Naples (981.374). Between 2010 and 2016, there has 
been an increase in foreigners of about 101,11%, and it has reached 14% of the 
centre’s population (13.241), one third of which resides in the Avvocata district 
(4.356)
27
. In comparison to the average rate of social unrest
28
 in Avvocata is in 
line with the average rate in Naples. However, Avvocata has one of the highest 
rates of unemployment in Naples, 7,27% compared to the city average of 7,06%
29
. 
Avvocata,  such  as  many  other  popular  areas of  the  historical  centre  in  Naples, 
shows a spontaneous mingle of urbanisation due to different groups which inhabit 
the area: low-income families carrying out activities to the limit of legality; middle 
class   composed   by   public   employees;   documented   and   undocumented 
immigrants; intellectuals who belong to the high class and own the buildings of 
the area (Laino, 2017). The Salita di Pontecorvo, where the Cappuccinelle complex 
is located, is considered by many as “another world”.      It is mainly composed of 
clans, meaning that the majority of the residents are relatives to a certain extent
30
.  
In  the  opinion  of  the  Scugnizzo  activists,  this situation  notably  facilitates  the 
interaction among local inhabitants.

 As the 2017 National Statistical Report (Istat,  2017) shows the city centre of Naples is a “popular area 
susceptible to degradation” that still housing about 2/3 of the City Council population.

 The “social unrest index” is based on the rate of unemployment and the enrollment rate in the schools in the 
city and is compared to the national average.

 In Naples, the “social unrest index” is 11,09, with a peak of 25,78 in Scampia and a drop of 1,45 in Arenella. 
In Avvocata it is 6,84. Ibidem, Appendix B.

9 Regulations and policies 
The ongoing process happening in the Cappuccinelle complex is part of a broader 
strategy adopted by the Municipality of Naples, based on common goods and the 
notion of “civic uses” (usi civici) which are defined as the local community’s right 
“to  benefit  from  (state,  local  or  private)  lands,  water  and  forest  [...]  subject  to 
construction  and  privatization  restrictions”
31
.  Specifically,  the  Municipality  has 
been  experimenting  with  new  urban  governance  tools  to  give  back  to  the  local 
community  public  and  private  abandoned properties. This term “civic  use”  (uso 
civico), thus, refers to a collective free use of public and private spaces, inspired 
by the constitutional principles of art. 43 of the Italian Constitution
32
. It «focuses 
on the possibility to entrust the ‘user communities’ (along with public bodies) with 
the management of essential services or energy resources» (Ciancio, 2018:287). 
The Neapolitan  model has  brought  citizens  to  the  core  of  the  decision-making 
process,  overcoming  the  dualism  of  the  public-private  regime  based  on  new 
community relations (Masella, 2018). Since 2011, the neo-elected Mayor Luigi De 
Magistris has been opening the way to a new shared and participatory system to 
identify  and  implement  local  policies  inspired  by  principles  and  concepts  of  the 
commons. After the well-known  national  referendum  (June  2011),  during  which 
Italians were called to vote about common goods related matters (e.g. water)
33
, 
Naples was the first (and in some respect the only) city to put into practice the 
referendums results regarding the issue of water supply
34
. Hence, several of the 
city council and mayor’s office resolutions have been carried out to the framework 
of the urban commons’ assets. The first act of 2011 was the modification of the 
Municipality Statute by including the legal notion of common goods (art.3, c.2)
35,
 
and  establishing  Italy’s  first  department  for  this  matter: Department  of  Town 
Planning and  Common Goods’ (Assessorato  ai  beni  comuni  e  all’urbanistica). In 
2012, the Naples Laboratory for the Constituent of Common Goods (Laboratorio 
Napoli per una costituente dei beni comuni) was established
36
. The laboratory is 
composed of thematic chambers accessible to citizens that can act as an advisory 
body and express citizens' concerns. The Laboratory, thus, is set to support the 
development of bottom-up initiatives meant for the care and regeneration of the 
urban commons. In the same year, the Regulation of the Council for the Legislation 
of Common Goods (Regolamento delle consulte per la disciplina dei beni comuni) 
was  also  approved  to  set  principles  for  the  governance  and  management  of

categories  of  companies,  which refer to essential public  services or energy sources or to  monopolies and that 
have a prominent general interest.” 
33
 This was the opportunity to clarify Italians’ opinion about four topics: the first two regarded local public 
services, namely water service privatization, and the following nuclear energy and legitimate impediment 
(leggittimo impedimento). 
34
 We refer to the transformation of the former company for the hydric service, Naples Water Resources 
Company (Azienda Risorse Idriche Napoli), in accordance with the principles of the commons, i.e. Abc Naples – 
Water Common Good (Abc Napoli - Acqua Bene Comune).

 The Council resolution no. 24 of 22.09.2011 included in Title I of the Statute, entitled Fundamental purposes

as functional to the exercise of fundamental rights in the ecological context and it guarantees their full enjoyment 
in the sphere of municipal competences.”

common goods for 2013
37
. In this framework, the initiative held 
in March 2012 carried out by part of the workers of the cultural sector
38
 played a 
crucial role in this policy-making process. In particular, we refer to the informal 
occupation of a 16th-century public building (about 4000 square meters) located 
in the historical city centre of Naples, known as the Ex Asilo Filangieri. In 2013, 
the building was renovated to host the Universal Forum of Culture
39
  and it was at 
the  centre  of  controversy  because  of  the  absence  of  transparency  in  the 
management of the event and of the building itself (Ciancio, 2018). Hence, the 
choice to use the Ex Asilo Filangieri as the location of the International Forum of 
Cultures inspired the occupation of the space. Since, activists stated, this would 
have produced an additional underused public space (Ostanel, 2017). Moreover, 
members of the workers of the cultural sector movement  founded  the group La 
Balena by  gathering  experts, in  particular  lawyers,  strongly  engaged  in  the 
regulation of the commons
40
. The group started working on a proposal to regulate 
the  use  of  common  goods in  order  to  submit  it  to  the  local  authority  in  charge. 
Their intention was to surpass the classic concession agreement model, which is 
founded  on  the  monopolistic  view  of  the  public-private  partnership,  and  to 
recognize  the  existence  of  an  “informal  community”  (city  inhabitants  and  local 
communities) to collectively act in the general interest (Iaione, 2019). Thus, the 
Ex Asilo became a proactive actor in a dialogical process with the public authority 
representatives. The first step in the process was: “[..] to guarantee a democratic 
form  of  management  of  the  monumental  common  good  called  the  Ex  Asilo 
Filangieri. In accordance with art. 43 of the Constitution, in  order  to  facilitate 
the  practice  of  the uso  civico of  the  common  goods,  in  relation  to  the 
community of cultural workers”
41
. Hence, with the resolution no.400 (2012), the 
Municipality  started  to  recognise  and  co-design  urban  common  governance 
mechanisms through the involvement of the community inhabitants that wanted 
to deliver forms of cultural and social services. The ex-Asilo Filangieri is identified 
as a place where free access and the enjoyment of common goods are ensured, 
and where the culture of the commons develops (Piscopo, 2017).

 It is important to underline that the civic use policy tool design not derived mainly from the Municipality, but 
it is the Ex Asilo the main designer and creator of it (Ostanel, 2017).

The “civic use” (uso civico) is a traditional legal institute which dates back to old 
rights   of   collective   enjoyment   of   earthly   goods   (Cinanni,   1962).   The 
reinterpretation of this “device”, which has been taking place in Naples, transfers 
this  old  right  from  the  original  structures  of  pasture,  hunting  or  firewood  to 
abandoned real estate and urban context.  
Relying on this concept, a city regulation was conceived and drafted by 
grassroots organizations within a squatted public building in Naples’ historic 
center, named Ex Asilo Filangieri. In parallel, several resolutions approved by the 
city council of Naples (e.g. no. 400/2012; 893/2015; 446/2016) recognize 
squatted places if they serve community needs (cultural services, welfare, 
refugee protection, health services, housing). The city pays ordinary expenses, 
the building is collectively managed, and the property remains public. Since there 
is neither a transfer nor a delegation of the good, the process does not 
correspond to a specific set of provisions under Italian law. On the contrary, self-
organization and self-governance are identified as legal forms by the municipal 
regulation. Miciarelli (2017) points out that it represents an unusual and creative 
use of the law. The process aims at researching alternative regulations, which 
are also inspired by principles based on “horizontal subsidiarity” (sussidiarietà 
orizzontale). This results in the change of Art. 118 of the Italian Constitution in 
2001, which now states that “[...] State, regions, metropolitan cities, provinces 
and municipalities encourage the autonomous initiative of citizens in starting 
collective interest activities”. Based on Iaione’s point of view (2019), it has 
enabled citizens, as individuals or as part of associations, to take care of 
common interests, breaking up the public authorities’ habitual monopoly in that 
field. Hence, it has supported an opportunity to develop a new governance model 
which takes into account the concept of the commons. 
 
In 2013, the Municipality of Naples further consolidated the ongoing process with 
the   introduction   of the   Permanent   Observatory   of   Common   Goods 
(Osservatorio  permanente  sui  beni  comuni  della  città  di  Napoli). The 
observatory  is  a  public  body  with  analytical  and  operational  functions  on  the 
common goods protection and management. It is also entrusted with the inventory 
of  the  municipal  properties,  including  private  assets, abandoned,  unused  or 
underused. This body is composed of eleven experts in the field of common goods 
who have experience in social activism, including representatives of the current 
Neapolitan common goods network
42
. It carries out “study functions, analysis and 
plans  for  the  protection  and  management  of  the  commons”;  it  evaluates  the 
Municipalities  Councils  proposals  and proposals  of  the Commissions  Council 
concerning common goods. It has been argued that the Observatory is, in practice, 
the space where «mutual learning between "low" and "high" cultures» (Ostanel, 
2017:14) takes place.

The Permanent Observatory of Common Goods (Osservatorio permanente sui beni 
comuni della città di Napoli) is an important experiment in terms of institutional 
innovation which supports community involvement and community building. The 
Observatory  as  an  advisory  body  was  established  by  a  Mayoral  Decree  (no. 
314/2013)  and  its  members  are  selected  through  public  notice,  or  by  mayoral 
appointment. The members of the observatory are not remunerated. They meet 
in  public  assemblies  and  anyone  can  take  part,  as  a  way  to  ensure  open  and 
horizontal discussions. 
Specifically, they work on mapping used and unused public or private properties 
(always  abandoned),  to  encourage  their  reuse  in  cultural  and  social  activities. 
Furthermore,   the   observatory   supports   the   self-governing   process   of   the 
communities taking care of public properties and contributes to the development 
of declarations of public use and urban collectives. It promotes the creation of links 
between the different associations and volunteering networks on the territory; it 
works with  the  relevant  departments  to  collect  requests  for  temporary  use  and 
common  use  of  those  properties  to  be  assessed;  it  evaluates  the  proposals  in 
deliberations  with a  focus  on  common  properties,  participative  democracy,  new 
municipalism  and  fundamental  rights  like  the  right to  housing  (Mayoral  Decree 
314/2013). 
 
In 2015, a further step forward was the establishment of the "Directions for the 
identification and management of real estate assets of the Municipality of Naples, 
that  are  not  being  used  or  partially  used  and  perceived  by  the  community  as 
‘commons’  and  susceptible  to  collective  use"  (Indirizzi  per  l’individuazione  e  la 
gestione dei beni del patrimonio immobiliare del Comune di Napoli, inutilizzati o 
parzialmente utilizzati, percepiti dalla comunità come “beni comuni” e suscettibili 
di fruizione collettiva)
43
. This Municipality Resolution established the possibility to 
identify a common good as being characterized by a “civic and collective use” (uso 
civico  e  collettivo). Consequently,  the  public  administration gives citizens  (as 
informal group of citizens and not organized in a specific legal entity) «the space 
to be active in forms of co-management of the political and cultural process of the 
city» (Miciarelli in Ciancio, 2018:289). 
“Scugnizzo Liberato is part of a group of buildings which were first occupied then 
allocated to the municipality, because it belongs to and is used by a community 
of citizens. So, the gift is not for associations or legal-accredited bodies but for a 
community that, by its own nature, changes over time.” Enrico Tommaselli 
In  the  same  year,  this  regulatory  process  also  led  to  the  drafting  of  the 
“Declaration of the Urban and Civic and Collective use” (Dichiarazione di uso 
civico e collettivo urbano), written by the ex Asilo community and approved by the 
Municipality Council
44
. The declaration is composed of a set of rules that carved 
out the self-governace of the good by the community of inhabitants. Thus, “the 
autonomous model (capable of generating a self-regulation system) containing the 
declaration of civic and collective urban use (...) as a set of rules to access, the 
                                       
43
 Council resolution no. 7, 2015, amending resolution no. 259 of 2014. Moreover, it is important to underline 
resolution no.259 of 2014 that included an administration proposal on privately owned abandoned heritage.

program  and  develop  activities  as  an  innovative  model  of  the 
government of the public space”
45
 was adopted. In 2016
46
, seven public properties 
being informally occupied were recognized as “relevant civic spaces to be ascribed 
to the category of urban commons”
47
 giving life to the so-called network of “freed 
spaces” (spazi  liberati) in the city. Along with  the  former  Cappuccinelle  convent 
there are the former Schipa School; Villa Medusa; ex-Lido Pola; ex-Opg (nowadays 
ex-Opg  Je  so  ’pazz);  former  Teresiane  convent  (now  Giardino  Liberato  di 
Materdei); former convent of Santa Maria della Fede (now Santa Fede Liberata).  
Also   recognized   as   “emerging   common   goods”,   these   assets   represent   a 
community-led initiative, carried out by groups of citizens and / or committees. 
They  transformed  the  abovementioned  assets  into  places  “of  strong  sociality, 
elaboration of thought, of intergenerational solidarity and of deep rooting on the 
territory” (Piscopo, 2017).  As Daniela Buonanno
48
 points out, in order to have a 
common good, there must be a cohesive community of neighbourhood inhabitants, 
aware and capable of bearing the responsibility of the process. 
Moreover, on the model of the ex-Asilo,  the recognition by Municipality resolution 
no. 446 (2016) will be finalised with adequate agreements after the communities 
managing the spaces draft a Declaration of Civic and Collective Use (Dichiarazione 
di uso civico e collettivo urbano) ensuring that the governance of the assets are 
inclusive, accessible and impartial (Iaione, 2019). However, it is still an ongoing 
process for all the seven spaces. It has to be noted that the Department of Town 
Planning  and  Commons  Goods’ (Assessorato  ai  beni  comuni  e all’urbanistica) 
evaluates  the  civic  use  of  the  property  by  monitoring  the  promoted  public 
services
49
 and checking the real openness of the self-governing process. Annually, 
each space has to provide the administration with a detailed report on the activities 
carried out and on the results of the self-government process.  
The abovementioned processes, thus, defines the administrative structure has led 
to  the  formalization  of  the  commons  in  Naples. In  synthesis,  the  Municipality, 
owner and administrator of the good, manages it through third parties (Micciarelli, 
2017),  putting  in  place  of  a  new  form  of  public-community  or  public - civic 
partnership (PCPs) (Iaione, 2019).  
Since there is neither custody nor a delegation of the good, the process 
does  not  correspond  to  a  specific legal  set  that  is  recognized  by  Italian 
law. On the contrary, self-organization and self-governance are identified 
as legal forms by the Municipality regulation.   
In this context, the municipality fosters «the development of a civil environment, 
supporting  the  citizens  in  their  process  of  becoming  a  proper  institution 
themselves» (Ciancio,  2018:289). Naples’  Urban  Civic  Uses  policy  aims  to 
recognize  the  urban  commons  as  collectively  owned,  overcoming  both  the 
individual  property  regime  and  the  traditional  public  management  one  (Scala, 
2018). As  mentioned  by  Iaione  (2019),  this  allowed  for  the  community-led 
initiatives to be recognized and institutionalized which ensured that both parties

involved were autonomous: citizens involved in the reuse and the 
municipality are enabling the practice.  
Finally, it is worth it to note that the majority of these spaces
50
 are in the historic 
centre of the city and identified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1995. In 
particular, the former Asilo Filangieri was part of the UNESCO Big Project (Grande 
Progetto  UNESCO)
51
, i.e.  the  enhancement  plan  operating  in  the  UNESCO  area 
(approximately  720  hectares),  which  includes  the  whole  city  built  before  World 
War II. Within this perimeter, the municipal administration monitors landscape and 
urban conditions, as well as characteristics of renovation/construction projects in 
accordance with limits set by law. The Department of Town Planning and Common 
Goods’ (Assessorato ai beni comuni e all’urbanistica) has been collaborating with 
superintendence offices, to define possible trajectories of reuse. One of the main 
issues is how to make the system more flexible, particularly with respect to the 
change of use. Although the Neapolitan model has recently gained recognition as 
part of the European best practices
52
, it has to be noted that in Italy it has been 
widely criticized from the viewpoint that it creates tools to foster illegal practices 
i.e. building occupations
53
. 
10 Actors 
In  order  to  describe  all  the  actors  involved in  the  Scugnizzo  Liberato,  we  will 
proceed chronologically. As mentioned above, the Scugnizzo Liberato arose from 
the  Scacco  Matto,  a  group  of  local  university  student  activists  formed  in  2015. 
Since  the  beginning,  the  group  founded  its  political  activity on  a  campaign  to 
recover abandoned spaces located in the Avvocata area by encouraging citizens’ 
participation. Firstly,  the  Scacco  Matto  occupied  a  small  space  next  to  the 
Montesanto Station
54
 and to the former Filangieri Institute. In  September  2015, 
the group squatted the Cappuccinelle complex and, with the aim of involving the 
inhabitants in the management of the space, activists immediately opened it to 
everyone. Then,  the  Scacco  Matto  expanded  progressively,  becoming  first  and 
foremost a network of collectives, including the inhabitants of the neighbourhood 
and other city groups such as Nadir - Napoli direzione opposta and Nablus. 
“We have put up posters to communicate that this space was once again open 
for all. We strived to inform everyone that we wanted to recover and re-
functionalize it collectively. This transparency increased the popularity of the 
project and the overall citizens’ involvement. People were also very curious about 
the space itself, since it had been locked for almost two decades. They were 
curious about what was hidden inside. Many of them approached us, so we could 
establish our first relationships” Valerio Figliuolo 
Hence, the will to establish a dialogue with the public authority emerged among 
the Scacco Matto activists who decided to join the local “neo-municipal” movement 
                                       
50
 All except for ex Lido Pola and Villa Medusa which are in the Bagnoli area in the west of the city.

Massa Critica. Massa Critica was born in October 2015 as a shared 
platform composed of political stakeholders, including associations, committees, 
city networks and urban movements (Gargiuolo and  Cirulli,  2017). Its  objective 
was  “to  affect  the  governance  of  our  territories,  to  continue  the  path  of  active 
resistance  that  makes  the  city  of  Naples  an  exceptional  laboratory  of  self-
organization that sometimes manages to dictate the political agenda also to the 
municipal  administrations;  to  open  places  of  political  discussion  and  generalize 
them; to rethink forms, methods, contents, and ways of relating”
55
. The purpose 
of Massa Critica was to support the creation of active citizenship models through 
a path of dialogue with the municipality, in order to reach the kind of relationship 
already created with the Asilo Filangieri community. Objectives were discussed in 
thematic meetings in which the topics of how the common goods and real estate 
played  a  central  role.  While  the  two  main  resolutions  on  the  matter – i.e. 
Declaration  of  civic  and  collective  urban  use  of  the  Asilo  Filangieri,  and  the 
identification of the seven spaces of civic importance ascribable to the category of 
common assets – were approved. Meanwhile, the Scacco Matto network broke up 
which  gave  space  to  a  new  territorial  community,  the  Scugnizzo  community. 
Nevertheless,  the  Scugnizzo  Liberato  has  kept  cooperating  with  the  other 
communities of the commons, trying to bring forward this experience collectively. 
The platform proposed by Massa Critica went on to become the Table of Common 
Goods or Public Assembly of Freed Spaces (Tavolo dei beni comuni or Assemblea 
pubblica  degli  spazi  liberati) which  includes  some  representatives  of  the  seven 
spaces,  along  with the  ex-Asilo  Filangieri  community. The  assembly  gathers  at 
least once per month, at the former Asilo Filangieri, in order to discuss hypothetical 
new  tools  to  improve  the  governance  of  the  common  goods  and  to  strengthen 
existing experiences in matter of self-organization, self-government, self-recovery 
and  community  participation.  Hence,  it  keeps  tracing  the  path  towards  the 
common  goods  by  following  the  administrative,  political  and  social  outcomes. 
Moreover, this coalition has collectively written the “Declaration of the Urban and 
Civic  and  Collective  use” (Dichiarazione  di  uso  civico  e  collettivo  urbano), of all 
spaces, sharing this responsibility with the entire network: 
“In February 2019, after a year of collective action, all the spaces were able to 
write their civic use declaration for a public urban use. The municipal 
administration should approve them all by the end of 2019. Since topics such as 
self-management and communication are key elements on the Table of Common 
Goods, we decided on a joint coordination of the declaration for the use of the 
areas.” Gaia Del Giudice 
The work of this table flows into the Permanent Observatory on the Common Goods 
(Osservatorio permanente cittadino sui beni comuni) which mediates between the 
collective work of the table and the municipal administration, working in synergy 
with the civil society
56
. As it is clear, another central actor is the municipality itself. 
If  its  role  is  crucial  in  the  definition  of  the  policy  and  legal  framework  of  the 
commons,  with  the  formal recognition  of  each  common  good,  such  as  the 
Scugnizzo  Liberato,  the  Municipality  undertakes  specific  responsibilities  on  that 
asset e.g. managing expenses and utilities and by ensuring adequate accessibility 
and safety of the building. Despite this, as already argued, the economic support

of the municipality, is in practice often insufficient. Especially in 
the case of extraordinary maintenance costs
57
, preventing the proper maintenance 
of the Cappuccinelle convent. As Fabrizio Vitali underlines, on some occasions it 
was possible to overcome the public impasse solely by private citizens cooperating. 
Within  the  Naples’  Municipality,  the  first  partners  for  the  refurbishment  of  the 
building were: 
• The Special Water Company for the Common Good (azienda speciale 
acqua bene comune Napoli) – ABC, a Company born from the 
transformation into a special public company of ARIN S.p.A. and which 
operates in order to ensure the excellent quality of water distributed 
and the regularity of the supply;  
• Waste Management and separate waste collection, with the 
Environmental Health Services Company (azienda servizi igiene 
ambientale) - ASIA Napoli Spa - Napoli Spa, the joint-stock company 
with local public capital, for waste disposal and green area cleaning. 
• The Parks and Gardens Management Service (gestione parchi e 
giardini) is part of an "online service card", which allows citizens to 
consult the list of all the services they can request from the municipal 
offices
58
.  
At neighbourhood level, the Scugnizzo community shares many of the assembly 
moments with other subjects of the Neapolitan political scene and with collectives 
and urban movements outside the network of the commons. These are committed 
mostly to environmental issues and to the right to housing or student collectives, 
including: Zero81 - Mutual Aid Lab

;  The  occupied  church  in

effort,  above  described  and  mainly  held  “outside”  the  complex,  in  the  urban 
environment, shows the willingness of the group not only to share and encourage 
good practices but also to foster the debate, as Fabrizio Vitale states, “in terms of 
mutualism and active citizenships with national bodies that work on the matters.” 
In the managing of internal activities of the complex, the network of actors varies 
systematically. As an exception, part of these actors run the macro-area of stable 
activities (craft labs and mutual support activities). These groups are: the artisan 
community   (including   teachers   of   the   Arts   Academy   in   Naples);   several 
communities of migrants, especially the Sri Lanka and Cabo Verde communities 
based in Avvocata; Nadir, a collective composed of musicians and technicians who 
follow the cultural production; Cuore di maschera, a group for theatre productions; 
the Naples popular aid network that, thanks to the group Oggi nessuno escluso, 
fights  poverty  and  discrimination; Nablus,  a  collective  promoting  activities  for

migrant integration; Banda Basaglia teaching music; the Aya lab, 
an art collective; the Neapolis balfolk group, proposing dance lessons; the Spartak

Fundation,  administering  the  Hermann  Nitsch  Museum - Archive  Laboratory  for 
contemporary arts, located alongside the Salita Pontecorvo, cooperates with the 
Scugnizzo  and  the  municipality  to  transform  Avvocata  district  into  an  art  and 
craftsmanship neighbourhood
59
. 
 
11 Governance and community 
The  Scugnizzo  Liberato  is  a  co-designed  space where  plural and  heterogeneous 
communities  take  actions,  by  activating  services  and  sharing  experiences  with 
neighbours. As previously introduced, it is a "territorial community" engaged in a 
project based on the principles of mutualism, self-management and self-recovery. 
“Before joining the process, neighbours used this place. Then, we gradually 
involved them in the overall management, sharing a common goal: how to re-
use this space. Others, like migrants, instead, joined immediately. Due to several 
reasons, among which the size of the complex itself, everyone considered this 
space a place that could fill several needs. Thus, the Cappuccinelle became 
attractive, and it keeps attracting many.” Fabrizio Vitale 
As activists underline, the Scugnizzo is self-governed through interdependent and 
radically democratic practices. Spatial organization and activities  are  planned  at 
weekly assemblies where all interested citizens (even those outside the Scugnizzo 
community) are invited to participate. This organization aims at consolidating the 
relationship between the community and project, creating bonds of mutual trust 
and cooperative dialogue which are needed to achieve results. In addition, Gaetano 
Quattromani
60
 maintains that these moments of congregation are fundamental in 
allowing interactions among community members – usually coming across the ex-
convent in different times, spaces and manners. Additionally, assemblies are also 
the opportunity to share ideas about specific management issues and to encourage 
the  exchange  of  good  practices. Assemblies  are  organized  as  follow:  (a)  a 
management assembly (assemblea di gestione) and (b) four thematic assemblies 
(tavoli  tematici).  Whereas  the  latter  gathers  community  members  engaged  or 
interested  in  specific  topics,  the  former  is  a  sovereign  assembly  which  brings 
together  the  whole  community.  It  must  be noticed  that  interviewees  conferred 
equal  value  to  both  kinds  of  meeting,  stressing  the  a-hierarchical  logic  of  the 
system. During  the  management  assembly  (assemblea  di  gestione)  the  routine 
management   of   the   complex   it   is   organized,   meaning   the   activities   are 
programmed,  the  recovery  work  is  scheduled,  as  well  as  communication  and 
logistic.  To  mediate  disagreements,  several  interaction  activities  are  taken  in 
concrete  and  supported  by  a  psychologist  of  the Scugnizzo community,  who 
attends the assembly in person. As mentioned above, the four thematic assemblies 
(tavoli  tematici)  focus  on  the  most  relevant  themes  of  the  Scugnizzo:  craft,

mutualism,  culture  &  events,  and  narrative. The  first,  craft 
assembly,  brings  together  artisans,  coffee  shop  and  kitchen  activists.  This 
assembly has been created to support a productive and economic perspective of 
the common goods. The mutual aid assembly aims to build and to put in practice 
a  territorial  strategy  based  on  mutualism.  It  includes  representatives  of  the 
community,  particularly  who  are  able  to  deal  with  relationship  problems  which 
often  occur  in  the  ordinary  living  of  the  community.  The  activity  of  the  third 
assembly,  culture  &  events,  is  mainly  to  focus  on  the  management  of  cultural 
activities, festival and events taking place in the Scugnizzo (weekly, monthly and 
annually). Finally,  the  narration  assembly  is  a  discussion  space  where  a 
communication strategy regarding the common goods is put forward. As Fabrizio 
Vitali  argues, since  the former Scacco  Matto  group came  from a  counterculture 
movement  and  strongly  political-oriented,  a  reflection  upon  this  represents  a 
significant chance to build a new and more inclusive identity
61
. The decision making 
in the assemblies relies on the consensus model, never on majority vote, due to 
the fact that they are oriented to inspire a common feeling around each and every 
choice. These are  also  accompanied  by “informal  moments”  e.g.  chatting, 
meetings which are parts of the daily life of the space, etc. are crucial factors in 
the ex-convent  management. By  considering  the  disadvantaged  conditions  of 
Avvocata district, Fabrizio Vitali
62
 underlines the significance of these moments. In 
other  words,  establishing  solid  links  among  people  and  spaces  ensures  the 
Scugnizzo liveability. This system is linked externally with the Table of Common 
Goods or Public Assembly of Freed Spaces (Tavolo dei beni comuni or Assemblea 
Pubblica  degli  spazi  liberati),  with  the  ex-Asilo  Filangieri  and  thus  with  the 
Permanent   Observatory   on   the   Common   Goods   (Osservatorio   permanente 
cittadino sui beni comuni)
63
. 
12 Activities  
For the Scugnizzo community, the artisan vocation of the former convent has been 
of crucial value, since the beginning of the occupation. This is due to the nature of 
the neighbourhood itself, reflecting both the objectives of the UNESCO Big Project 
(Grande Progetto Unesco) and of the Municipality Council of Naples
64
.
 
 Indeed, the 
thematic  area  of  intervention  identified  creative  arts  and  craftsmanship  has 
promoted  the  rediscovery  of  local  labour  and  traditional  activities. As  Giuseppe 
Sbrescia
65
 points  out,  the  number  of  artisanal  activities,  which  have  always 
characterized  the  city  centre,  are  decreasing  and  often  replaced  by  tourist 
activities. The project received the  municipality  support,  that  was  based on the 
existing territorial strategy to support artisanal activities in the historic centre area

paid ones for adults; self-produced objects are sold to generate income to reinvest 
in the activities (e.g. materials) and in the space itself (maintenance). 
 
It is significant to underline that artisans, as well as everyone else, don’t pay any 
rent to  run their  activities
66
. Decisions  about  rooms’  allocation - to  singles or 
groups - are collectively taken in the management assembly. Selective criteria are: 
requests  presented  by  people  in  need of  a  workspace,  specifically  oriented  to 
support  and  develop craft  traditions, are  often  preferred; spaces must  not be 
subjected to “exclusive uses” but still have to be shared and managed in a common 
way; grantees have to participate in the collective restoration and management of 
the complex in addition to the single space

Currently, laboratories actives are distributed at ground and first floor as follows:

The  main  courtyard  is  also  used  as  a  football  field  and  it  hosts 
weekly the Spartakus San Gennaro, a popular soccer project participated by local 
teenagers. Additionally, the groups Nablus and Oggi Nessuno Escluso have been 
jointly running a school of language. Along with Italian and English courses, they 
offer  activities  such  as  legal assistance  for  immigrants  (available  also to  Italian 
inhabitants of the area as long as they are willing to undertake shared paths) and 
a canteen for the homeless and the distribution of food and clothes. 
On the ground floor there are also the following uses: 
• La Scugnizzeria, an information point;  
• a museum which collects photographs, artefact, documents of the 
complex; in addition, some former cells witnessed the past use of the 
Instituto Filangieri as a prison: 
• an open space, consisting of a bar and a free room mainly dedicated to 
assembly and other variable activities;  
• a kitchen and a canteen. 
 
As  mentioned,  a  church  (currently  closed)  can  be  accessed  from  the  first  floor 
where  the  gym,  the  language  school,  study  rooms,  and  the  theatre  are  also 
located. Some areas and rooms at the first floor are used by the Sri Lankan and 
Cape  Verdean  communities  which  every  Sunday  transform  the  gallery  in  a 
ceremonial space for the religious service. This space is also the venue for several 
cultural events among which the UE’ FEST
68
, the Mediterranean festival of comics 
and  self-produced  prints  which  since  April  2017  takes  place  in  the  Scugnizzo 
annually. As the UE’ FEST is gradually gaining national recognition, it’s important 
to keep reminding us that the Scugnizzo Liberato promotes an intense program of 
cultural  events  of  great  importance  at  the  local  and  metropolitan  level,  which 
include  concerts,  book  presentations,  and  theatre  performances.  Programs  and 
activities  change  continuously,  including  “regular”  activities  and  “external” 
proposals. Although  the  flexibility  and  the  dynamics  of  this  process  strongly 
encourage  the  communities’  participation,  it  has  to  be  noticed  that  the  rapid 
turnover shows also a weakness in terms of management.

scene.

13 Impact 
The  governance  of  the  commons  has  been  gaining  national  and  international 
recognition.  Naples is  considered a  relevant  laboratory  of  urban  and  social 
innovation, widely observed, studied and discussed. Obviously, the impact of the 
Scugnizzo experience cannot be considered apart from the complex context within 
which it emerged. For this reason, impacts of the macro and micro urban scale will 
be conveyed jointly. Indeed, as a result of the ex-Asilo Filangieri experience and 
of the following legal innovations, in 2017, Naples was selected as an URBACT best 
practice
69
. In 2018, Naples joined the Civic eState - URBACT III project as a lead 
partner. Civic eState net is one of the 25 "Transfer Networks" approved by URBACT 
in April 2018. Its purpose is to consolidate and implement the use of the common 
goods   and   collective   practices   of   heritage   management,   propagating   the 
Neapolitan experience. In particular, the network has been developing a focus on

sustainability issues, addressing one  of  the  most  significant 
weakness of the Naples’ experience
70
. 
By applying the framework of the commons, Barcelona, for instance, is currently 
working on a set of regulations to manage (selected) cultural heritage assets. A 
similar process has occurred also in other Italian cities such as Turin and Palermo. 
Locally, the network of the commons has been strongly impacting the metropolitan 
and urban area of Naples, boosting a cultural shift. In other words, the (social and 
territorial) mobilization put in place in the Scugnizzo, and in the other Neapolitan 
common goods, is changing preconceptions regarding places and people
71
. As Lina 
Mele states, this sets the ground for a more inclusive environment: 
“The Scugnizzo is a lively place frequented by both the folks of the block and by 
many others. I see people from all walks of life passing by. And I like this 
because it is the key to inclusion.”  
Additionally, from a different cultural perspective, the Scugnizzo has been 
attracting great interest not only at local level but also at metropolitan level due 
to the cultural proposal variety. It mainly comprehends alternative music, arts 
and theatre events, and it encourages the development of underground cultures. 
In particular: 
“Our theatre is considered one of the best concert halls in Naples! It really 
attracts a significant audience since is known we offer high-level countercultural 
events and setting. For us, this is in accordance with our political principles based 
on mutuality.” Valerio Figliuolo 
With reference to the space, the adaptive reuse process has also a strong impact 
on  the  Avvocata  district itself. As  several  interviewees  point  out,  the  Scugnizzo 
opening has improved the liveability of the area. Indeed, the former Cappuccinelle 
Convent  is  situated  in  a  dense  and  compact  urban  area  that lacks  significant 
gathering  space  and  square. The  Scugnizzo,  thus,  offers  a  new  urban  centre 
characterised by a high degree of freedom and inclusion, providing the Avvocata 
district with a meeting place, a piazza, which it lacked. Moreover, as the section 
“activities”  shows,  the  re-functionalization  of  the  former  complex  provided  the 
district with new services, both cultural and social. With regards to this, craft labs 
have a double role. In addition to being an incentive for learning artisanal labour, 
the spaces are granted for free which is a form of public support to the craftsmen 
who are economically disadvantaged
72
. Furthermore, the project sheds a light on 
other abandoned spaces converging in the same area, and on many communities 
around them
73

14 Heritage 
“This is a former 17
th
 Century convent, it is not a joke! We know we have a huge 
responsibility, so it is clear that we cannot just think about a socio-political 
project or occupying the building in the previous fashion. It is too precious. The 
community is becoming conscious of the architectural and historical value of the 
Cappuccinelle. Thus, the program of activities needs to agree and proceed 
parallel to a restoration project, preserving the complex in its integrity. In order 
to attain this aim, we are cooperating with the public authority.” Gaetano 
Quattromani 
Between  2009 and  2012,  the  Cappuccinelle  complex
74
 was  declared  an  Italian 
cultural  asset,  in  accordance  with  the  Rules  on  cultural  assets  and  landscape 
(Codice dei beni culturali e del paesaggio, d.lgs. 22/01/2004 no. 42). Since then, 
the  Ministry  for  Heritage  and  Cultural  Activities  (MIBAC)  is  responsible  for 
supervising  the  conservation  of  the  Cappuccinelle  complex. Also,  it implies  that 
any intervention on the complex must be approved by the local Soprintedenza, a 
branch of the MiBACT which has the responsibility to assure the conservation and 
management of cultural heritage within a specific territory. 
The complex is situated in the historical centre of Naples, inscribed in the list of 
UNESCO assets since 1995. As mentioned above, the UNESCO Big Project (Grande 
Progetto  UNESCO  per  Napoli)  is  a  renovation  plan  which  embraces  the  entire 
UNESCO area (about 720 hectares). So far, 26 projects have been financed thanks 
to  2014-2020  POR  FESR  Campania  funds.  With  the  exception  of  the  ex-Asilo 
Filangieri,  no  interventions  are  foreseen  for  those  assets  currently  identified  as 
common  goods. Even  though  the  Scugnizzo  Liberato  is  not  included  among  the 
interventions  selected  for  the  UNESCO  Big  Project,  the  area  where  the  former 
convent is located, namely Montesanto, underwent a large-scale renovation public 
program which affected the urban and infrastructural dimensions
75
. As mentioned, 
in 2014 the ownership of the Cappuccinelle property was passed to the Municipality 
Council. Hence, the UNESCO Program service presented a restoration proposal for 
the  ex-convent
76
, with the aim of preserving it by assuring proper maintenance 
and public accessibility. Moreover, the proposal includes the cultural purpose of 
the “Isola Pontecorvo”
77
 and of part of the Avvocata neighbourhood by the

rd
 July 2009 approved by the Regional Director of 
landscape and cultural assets of the Campania Region (Direzione regionale per i beni culturali e paesaggistici 
della Campania). 
75
 Among public interventions there are: the transformation of historical buildings in social housing buildings, 
the recovery of the Ventaglieri Park; the restoration of via Pignasecca; via and piazzetta Olivella including the 
monumental staircase of Montesanto (completed); the recovery of the Vico Lepri school complex; interventions 
in the Trinità delle Monache convent (considered the most relevant monumental and landscape centre in the 
area); the escalator system between Via Ventaglieri and Salita Cappuccinelle; the Montesanto metro station 
(Line 1), the Funicular change Funicular – circumflegrea, connected with metro Line 2 (construction work is 
about to start); the Diaz and Montecalvario stations (work in progress) and the cableway project Museo – 
Museo (Resolution no. 905, 2015).

restauration   of   key   public   and   private   buildings   aimed   at   creating   the 
“neighbourhood  of  the  arts” (quartiere  dell’arte).  The  plan includes  also  Nitsch 
Museum, the cultural structure  next  to  the  Scugnizzo  Liberato. This  objective  is 
part of a wider project of artistic and cultural improvement of the historical centre. 
As discussed, the Scugnizzo project concerning the uses (e.g. craft, culture, etc.) 
met the expectations of UNESCO and of the public authorities. In July 2019, several 
public authorities
78
 signed the Institutional Development Agreement – Naples City 
Centre (Contratto  istituzionale  di  Sviluppo – Centro  storico  di  Napoli). The 
agreement  assigned  a  capital  of  7.500.000  euros to  restoration  of  the  ex-
Cappuccinelle. The funds will be invested in the 2014 enhancement project which 
is  part  of  the  operative  plan Culture  and  Tourism - FSC  2014/2020  (Cultura  e 
turismo). This  combination  of  funds,  community  and  public  interests  shows an 
innovation in terms of urban strategy, explicitly supported by the Municipality, as 
evident from the words of Massimo Santoro:  
“It is a particularly innovative operation that being undertaken in the ex-
Cappuccinelle. In fact, we are organizing activities that fit with the inhabitants’ 
uses and practices. We could have said: ‘Project financing!’ and surely a private 
investor would have invested in the project. Instead, we decided to make 
another choice and we will keep looking for financing for the restoration of these 
assets. These buildings are not well preserved. Our objective is to intervene with 
these buildings in a way that is compatible with their current use through 
opportunities of financing that present itself to us.” Massimo Santoro 
In the interim stage of the financial transfer, the Municipality wants to develop a 
participation project with the Scugnizzo community. As Massimo Santoro
79
 states, 
it  is  a  very  delicate  stage  since  it  will  probably  find  the  disagreement  of  the 
community that often claims exclusive rights on building, although in violation of 
the Municipality regulations. The restoration project will follow public procedures 
set by local building regulations and national laws concerning cultural heritage, i.e. 
it  will  need  to  be  approved  by  the  responsible  superintendent.  In  this  regard, 
Santoro also highlights that the physical alteration of the complex is an unsolved 
issue since these buildings are managed by people that have low or no expertise 
in matter of cultural good and restoration. Although conflicts might arise between 
Soprintendenza’s requirements and those claimed by current users, it is significant 
to underline the relevance that the cultural value of the Cappuccinelle has for the 
Scugnizzo  community. This is  witnessed  also  by  an  important  collection  of 
memorabilia  which  includes  documents,  stamps,  writings,  wall  paintings  and

ancient  tools. This former  collection is displayed  in  the  small 
museum at the entrance of the ex-convent. 
 
15 The economic model 
According  with  the “civic  use” (uso  civico)  model,  the  Scugnizzo  community 
autonomously defines its own rules of use of the ex-Cappuccinelle, including any 
decision on its economic life. Though partially tested, the economic model of the 
Scugnizzo  is  still  in  an  initial  phase.  The  aim  of  the  community  is  to  create  a 
“mutual aid fund”, inspired by models of “regenerative” welfare, namely a system 
based on facilities which are able to regenerate the community economy. Profits 
produced by cultural activities should generate – as they already did – outcomes 
to invest in other material and immaterial activities such as courses and physical 
redevelopment of the spaces and, thus, this model shall support self-employment. 
Ideally, the fund should absorb urgent needs of community workers and, at the 
same time, safeguard the sustainability of the overall (economic and not) system. 
To guarantee fairness and balance, community representatives have been charged 
with  the  responsibility  to  manage  the  overall  economy  of  the  ex-convent.  In 
particular,  fundraising  and  mediation  between  community  and  institutions  are 
assigned to them.

“To define our model, it has been very important to take part in 
2017 – along with the ex-Asilo Filangeri - to Culturability, a national call 
promoted by Unipolis foundation
80
. This was an opportunity to shape the model 
we would like to proceed towards. We transform the old Cappuccinelle in a new 
factory where materials and knowledge are re-processed and promoted. For this 
reason, we want to support in parallel the production of the spaces and the 
inclusion of young generations.” Fabrizio Vitali 
It must be noticed that the Scugnizzo community – as others common goods - has 
a  short-term  “adoption”  of  the  complex  which  depends  on  the current  Mayor’s 
mandate
81
.  Activists  underlined  that  this  impacted  on  the  implementation  of  a 
long-term  and  strategic  vision  of  the  project,  weakening  their  efforts  towards  a 
more consistent fundraising. Current economy and management of the Scugnizzo 
are strongly related to the restoring and caretaking of the space, programmed in 
relation to structural priorities and/or emergency. So far, the Scugnizzo community 
has  relied  almost  exclusively  on  self-financing,  investing  profits  from  cultural 
events. These, indeed, have mainly been used to repair and restore the structure 
and its facilities. In addition, artisans independently finance materials and tools to 
develop  laboratories,  which  include  both  courses  held  on  a  volunteer  basis 
(children  and  adolescents)  and  paid  (adults);  self-produced  objects  are  sold  to 
generate income to be reinvested in the activities (e.g. materials) and still in the 
space  itself  (maintenance).  However,  in  2017  it  was  launched  a  crowdfunding 
campaign to support the renovation project of the theatre. In particular, this profit 
was invested in the sound insulation of the space, protecting the neighbourhood 
from noise
82
.  
In  conclusion,  the  city  pays  for  ordinary  expenses  such  as  utilities  and  security 
guards,  as  mentioned  above, because  they  do  not  have enough  economic 
resources to invest in the common goods. Despite this, other relevant details need 
to be mentioned. Naples’ policies are aimed at transforming the city assets into 
social  infrastructures that are  of public  value  and have social  impact  (Iaione, 
2019). Hence, it considers  the  social  value  (e.g.  community  service) within  the 
economic  value. Consequentially, the public real estate has gone from an asset 
that compensates for municipal losses, to resource that enables self-organisation 
groups to act for the collective interest. Therefore, it changes the main objective 
of  the  Municipality  from  maximizing economic  value  (exchange  value)  to 
maximizing social value (use value). Furthermore,  the  municipality  provides  the 
building  for free  for  the  community.  The  procedures  concerning  the  traditional 
                                       
80
 Culturability is a call for proposals supporting social innovation projects focused on recuperation of spaces. In 
September 2017, the Ex Asilo won this competition. As Ciancio (2008) highlights, it was the first time that a 
bank foundation recognized the participation in a contest about social regeneration by giving the award to an 
informal community. 
81
 It must be pointed out that the legal experimentations based on civic uses hereby discussed are linked to the 
specific mandates of the Mayor Luigi De Magistris (I mandate 2011-2016, and II mandate 2016- ). In other 
words, the recognition of the “7+1” cultural assets, under the umbrella of the common goods, will be over with 
the conclusion of the Mayor’s mandate. This, it has been argued, represents one of the main criticalities of the 
Neapolitans approach. Moreover, due to this fact many accused the Mayor of political-electoral alliance with 
some social movements in Naples. Therefore, in order to ensure a more sustainable and durable process, it has 
been decided to rely on constitutional principles, re-frame the administrative structure of the City Council (i.e. 
putting in place the Department of Common Goods and Planning, the Observatory of Common Goods, etc.) and 
mobilize strong communities of reference (Interview with Daniela Buonananno and Giuseppe Sbrescia. Naples, 
26
th
 April 2019). 
82
 It is the result of a consultation between the community and neighbours which complained about the noise 
during the night.

assignment  of  public  real  estate  such  as  rental  payments, 
expansive municipal charges, complicated procedures about safety standard, etc 
are  therefore  free: as  occupiers  that have  been formally  recognized,  the 
community is now free from these restrictions (Laino, 2018). 
16 Communication 
Communication   is   mainly   addressed   inside   the   “storytelling   assembly”,   a 
discussion  space  that  encourages  a  new  narrative  of  the  common  goods  by 
developing communicative strategies interlinked with specific urban issues of the 
city. 
This is expressed in the following channels: 
• Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/ScugnizzoLiberato/);  
• Twitter (https://twitter.com/scugnizzolibero);  
• Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/scugnizzoliberato/);  
• Website (https://scugnizzoliberato.org/).  
 
Facebook and the website mainly present programs and activities. They are also 
tools used by the municipal offices to monitor the evolution of the spaces, in 
accordance with municipal resolutions.

Executive summary 
The  adaptive  reuse  the  architectural  remains  of  the  former  coffin  factory 
(Sargfabrik),  the  embracing  of  its  past  (even  if  only  partially)  and  as  a  result 
combining the idea of a home with that of the activities surrounding death is a 
surprisingly avantgarde project. And making it more avantgarde is the fact that 
the housing concept put forward by the Association for Integrative Living (Verein 
für Integrative Lebensgestaltung, https://www.sargfabrik.at/Home/Die-
Sargfabrik/Verein) - formed  as  a  bottom  up  initiative - was based  on  collective 
living arrangement, a very much talked about/often supported housing form today, 
but less so in the 1980s, when the story of the Sargfabrik began (Lang, Carriou 
and Czischke 2018). The reuse of the Sargfabrik is an illustrative example of how 
bottom up initiatives can navigate in the bureaucratic field successfully to reach 
their goals, but of how uncomfortable heritage can be reinterpreted, how strategic 
forgetting  can  be  employed  and  how  an  aptly  employed  new  narrative  can 
influence the wider environment, contributing to its profound transformation on a 
neighbourhood level. (Pendlebury, Wang and Law 2017) 
The Sargfabrik is a housing project with a very clear social and cultural message 
and explicit social goals, focusing on integration and social equality both among 
its  residents  and  in  its  wider  neighbourhood. It  is  a  place  of  integration  that 
develops an urban space within itself. Along with the roof garden, a number of 
common  areas  are  available  for  communication  and  pleasure.  The  publicly 
accessible  cultural  house,  restaurant,  kindergarten,  conference  room  and  a 
twenty-four-hour bathhouse make it a meeting place for people of different ages 
and backgrounds. 
It is situated in the 14
th
 district in Vienna, in an area that had been traditionally 
full of small workshops but was rather desolate by the early 1980s, when the story 
of the Association began, as a result of changes in industrial production and city 
use  patterns.  The  once  rather  prestigious factory  (the  largest  of  its  kind  in the 
Austro-Hungarian monarchy)  was  closed,  creating  an  environment  of  industrial 
waste.  Although  reusing  the  site  required  architectural  compromises  from  the 
Association,  it  also  offered  opportunities,  and  importantly  it  was  available.  The 
building was not under any official heritage protection, still, the members of the 
Association decided to keep a single physical relic from its past, the chimney. It 
has been maintained ever since despite the increasing costs. The connection with 
the factory’s history has been strengthened on an intangible level as well, both in 
the design – one could argue that the balconies resemble strongly a coffin – and 
in  the  narrative.  The  latter  has  been  supported  both  by  keeping  the  name 
Sargfabrik  and  the  organisation  of  two  exhibitions  on  site  about  the  factory’s 
history. 
Ties  to  the  history  of  Vienna  appear  yet  at  another  level  as  well:  although  the 
specific  constellation  of  the  project  is  very  individual,  its  creation  is  embedded 
deeply in the Viennese housing history. Its success is indivisible from the tradition 
of supporting affordable housing for the residents in Vienna and is part and parcel 
of  the  municipality’s  very  conscious  project  to  accommodate  innovative  living

arrangements and bottom-up social innovation in the territory of its jurisdiction. 
In this sense it connects the municipal working-class homes (Arbeitshöfer) of the 
1920s with the large-scale projects of the 2000s that include the building of a new 
city  district  in  Aspern. All  these  housing  projects  put  an  emphasis  on  common 
facilities, communal living and the tradition of relatively accessible housing. 
Coming  from  the  scene  of  the  1980s  green  movements,  the ecological  aspects 
were always considered to be of outstanding importance for this group of people. 
These original residents of the Sargfabrik were mostly middle income. They fought 
very hard for their dream, overcoming both administrative and financial obstacles, 
and  weathering  the  almost  10-year  process  between  founding the  Association 
(1987) and completing the first phase of the building (1996). (The second phase, 
the  so-called  Miss  Sargfabrik  was  finished  in  2000.)  Importantly,  despite  the 
difficulties  posed  by  the  long  waiting  period,  the  recollection  of  the  original 
residents is unanimous in a way that these years have contributed to strengthening 
the  community,  who  have  developed  effective  ways  of  handling  conflicts  and 
resolving disputes. 
The  Sargfabrik  was  realised  before  collaborative  housing  arrangements  became 
more mainstream, and it can easily be termed as a classic social innovation project. 
(Oosterlynck et al. 2013) Founding members not only wanted to change the lives 
of  those  involved  but  also  had  bigger  intentions – they wanted  to  influence  an 
entire Viennese neighbourhood. To achieve this, they have taken integration very 
seriously, practicing it in different aspects of their daily operation:  
o they maintain comparatively affordable rental prices and support a 
self-sustained social fund to integrate people of different income 
levels in the Sargfabrik housing complex. 15% of all housing units 
are reserved for elderly, disabled or displaced; 
o they seek to integrate people with different working capacities 
maintaining a cafe where people with disabilities can work;  
o they consciously integrate the world from outside to their daily 
routines through the public kindergarten, the swimming pool and 
most importantly the cultural centre; and  
o finally, on a more abstract level they integrate the old with the new 
when they reuse local history to create a new building and 
environment.  
  
Today,  this  multi-level  integration  project  is  of  unquestionable  success,  with 
waiting  lists  for  people  wanting  to  move  in  and  similar  housing  arrangements 
appearing elsewhere in Vienna. Furthermore, the Sargfabrik has been the topic of 
countless  academic  inquires  and  political  visits,  including  mayors  from  abroad. 
Despite  these,  the  future  holds  many  questions,  most  importantly  that  of  the 
sustainability. As it seems now the current cost level could be hard to maintain, 
the current rent level is lower than in the neighbourhood, but it is doubtful how 
long this can last. The building complex needs imminent renovation, and so far, 
the community does not have the required funding. There is also the question of 
demography and age composition of the community. The original residents have

aged, but they do not want to move out, while many children, who grew up here 
would like to stay. And finally, the relationship with the neighbourhood is changing 
– whereas the surroundings used to be run down, it has been gentrifying steadily, 
partially  as  a  result  of  general  housing  market  and  economic  conditions,  and 
partially as a result of the Sargfabrik itself, which brought it new life to the once 
derelict area.

1. Introduction 
“Living – culture – integration” – this is the motto of Sargfabrik, one of Austria’s 
most complex bottom-up housing projects. In 1996, on the site of a former coffin 
manufacturer in West Vienna (Matzner, District 14), an innovative style of living 
was realized by a non-profit housing association. But the Sargfabrik is much more 
than a housing model— it’s a way of life, something that resembles a small urban 
district, a “village in the city”. Since  then, the  Sargfabrik  is  admired  by many – 
because it is an unusual mix of public and private, because it is the expression of 
an individual will and an outstanding example of what can be achieved by a group 
of  people  with  a  shared  mission.  Grassroots  democracy,  co-determination, 
participatory planning  and  operation,  collective  ownership – these  are  the  most 
commonly  used  terms  related  to  the  Sargfabrik  project.  However,  what  really 
made it work is the people and their communication. People who “wanted to live 
there, and wanted to live together”.     
 
Due   to   the   unexpected   success and   immense   popularity of   Sargfabrik's 
apartments, in 1998 the association purchased another small plot on the opposite 
side of the street and built another experimental unit. In this project, known as 
Miss  Sargfabrik,  the  architectural  focus  was  again  on  the  community,  with  the 
motto “Separated and connected”, reflected both in the common spaces (shared 
kitchen, laundry, library) and the apartments.

The  project  is also characterized  by  ecologically  friendly  design  and  optimized 
energy consumption (green electricity, composting, solar water heating, etc.). 
Besides the dwellings, the building also contains a restaurant, a culture house, a 
seminar room, a Turkish bath, a swimming pool and a kindergarten, the majority 
of which are open public spaces. Based on a co-housing structure, the residential 
complex offers a variety of amenities such as a car sharing system and laundromat. 
Considering all these functions, it is obvious that Sargfabrik is a   professional NGO 
like  functioning  similarly  to  a  business  company.  There  is  a  professional 
management, a balance sheet, all kinds of supervisor bodies that are involved in 
the every-day operation. There are responsible parties for all kinds of areas like 
the bathhouse, the seminar room, the events hall with its cultural program, and 
many more.

2 Anthropological analysis 
2.1 The story 
“We wanted to make the world better with our engagement, and this spirit is still 
there inside us.” (SF2: Board member, 2019) 
 
This project has a long history, dating back to the eighties. At that time a group of 
people got  together  and  raised  the  idea  of  “let’s  start  a  fun  project  where  not 
everything  is  run-of-the-mill,  something  that  goes  beyond  the traditions  of  the 
nuclear family and makes living interesting – or at least designed in an interesting 
way.” They   wanted to   realize   a   housing   association,   which   collectively 
accommodates  different  models  of  life  and  cultural  possibilities  and set  up  a 
registered association for integrative living in cooperation with two architects.  
Their  aim  was  to  create  a  community- and leisure-based housing estate and to 
design the new living quarters according to their ideas.   
 
At the very beginning it was just a small group of friends (10-12 people), they did 
not even know what they really wanted, but the essentials were clear: they did 
not  want  to  live  lonely  in  the  city  and  they  wanted  to  develop  something  in 
collaboration with others. These people were coming from the different scenes of 
civil  society  (at  that  time  they  called  it green political  movements) – mobility, 
peace, school, feminism, ecology, etc. They had the same interest, all of them felt 
an  inner  mission  to  make  the  world  a  better  place  to  live.  During  the  initial 
gatherings,  they  discussed  the  basic  ideas  of  a  housing  project  and  drafted 
fundamental papers on mutual responsibility for children, shared economies, social 
and cultural initiatives – utopias of a social-idealistic housing and living situation. 
And they started to look for a suitable property. One of the options was found in a 
newspaper announcement, saying that the Sargfabrik, a coffin factory was going 
bankrupt. Everyone thought the building was too big, too inconceivable. However, 
they  decided  to  go  ahead  and  have  a  look. On  May  3,  1989  the  Association 
purchased the building. 
 
The first design envisaged the preservation of the old production hall, the housing 
units were to be placed within this attractive brick building. In order to preserve 
the  hall,  a  decided  disadvantage  was  taken  into  account:  the  south-facing 
dwellings at the rear faced onto the hall, only their north front projected into the 
open.  The  project  was  submitted  for  planning  permission  in  this  form  and  was 
approved. Objections were raised by the Constitutional Court and the project was 
halted. With  all  kinds  of  problems  related  to  submission,  zoning,  and  building 
regulations,  the  building  was  increasingly  subjected  to  moisture,  despite  the 
protective measures taken. Eventually, they made it to a point where everything 
was  approved:  all  of  the  building  criteria,  the  insulating  of  steel  beams,  the 
preservation  of  the  brick  wall  outside.  But  the  costs  escalated  and  they  had  to 
draw the line. The architects then made a suggestion and the Association agreed:

they  had  the  building  permit  for  renovation,  and  they  decided  to  follow  it  by 
partially tearing the old factory down.  
“...all  these  collective  facilities  are actually  missing  in  today’s  urban  planning, 
where individual homes are being built. But that does not provide a vibrant city 
anymore.” (SF7: member of Association, 2019) 
 
During the long years of waiting for the different permissions, the Association kept 
on holding regular meetings. One outcome of these deliberations was the decision 
about building not a normal apartment block but a “residential home” or hostel 
(Wohnheim) which would belong to the association and be used by its members. 
The disadvantage of this solution is that no one actually owns the dwelling used. 
But  this  approach  also  had  an  important  advantage:  through  subsidies  it  was 
possible to actually build those communal facilities which  make  this  “residential 
home”  so  special. It  was  obvious  from  the  very  beginning,  that  beside  the 
dwellings, the community will need some collective facilities like the bathing house, 
a café, a kindergarten, a seminar room – so all these functions were part of the 
original idea of the Sargfabrik project. 
“When  buying  something  in  my  opinion  there  are  two  fundamentally  different 
models: Either we buy what we need and then figure out how to get reimbursed 
later. Or we take a systematic approach and determine: what do we need? How 
much will it cost? Which other options might we have? But in a way that we get a 
grip on the office finances. And this way we can determine that each one of us has 
to  contribute  a  certain  amount.” (SF7:  member  of  Association,  2019) – this 
question was raised in several meetings at the beginning of the project. And finally, 
this systematic approach was applied throughout the way.    
 
In  1996,  the  vision  of  self-defined  living  together  finally  became  a  reality.  110 
adults  and  45  children  moved  into  the  73  accommodation  units.  Due  to  the 
unexpected  success  of  Sargfabrik’s  residence  and  operation,  the  Association 
purchased another plot on the opposite side of the street in 2000, and built another 
experimental  house. In  addition  to  the  extraordinary  architecture  of  this second 
building,  there  are  also  some  special  facilities:  a  socio-pedagogical  living 
community of the Youth office of the City of Vienna; three wheelchair-accessible 
housing  units,  small  apartments  for  students  and  young  people,  five residential 
units with studio character as “home office”, a guest living unit, teleworking, a club 
room especially for young people, a library and a communal kitchen with dining 
area.  
  
Both  Sargfabrik  and  Miss Sargfabrik  were  committed  to  participatory  design 
strategies and community engagement: during the planning process (7 years for 
Sargfabrik, 2 years for Miss Sargfabrik) BKK-2 (later BKK-3) initiated discussions 
and brainstorming sessions with the potential tenants to find out their personal 
desires as well as communal aspiration, and ways in which the building would still 
be functional in 20 years’ time.

2.2 Governance 
“When I consider the term codetermination, then to me it means that something 
needs to be decided and I can do a little participating. We were always interested 
in creating things, in embracing processes and actually influencing their creation. 
When I take the concept of codetermination a bit further, then it means 
assuming responsibility.” (SF9: Board member, 2019) 
Back  in  the  eighties,  when  this  group  of  people  founded  the  Association,  two 
objectives were clear: (1) they wanted to share what they had and (2) they wanted 
to create a “better small society”. They always tried to choose the most democratic 
way of organizing things. But “democracy is hard work in decision making” – said 
one  member  of  the  Association. By  now,  after  more  than  30  years  of  living 
together, they became “masters of conflict resolution and communication” (SF1: 
office manager, 2019).     
At  the  beginning,  there  was an  attempt  to  reach  consensus  on  every single 
decision. Sometimes this was a very time consuming and tiring process and the 
“winners” were those who could stay awake until the end of the debate. But on 
the other hand, the long debates helped to fully understand the counterarguments. 
“This was a great lesson in social skills. Naturally it cost us lots of blood, sweat 
and tears” – remembers one member. At certain point they involved an external 
professional to moderate the debates. This was also part of the learning process.  
The decision-making process evolved during the years. “Can you live with that” – this 
was a magic sentence at the  biginning. One didn’t have to say “yes, I want it that way” 
but instead “yes, I can live with that”. This was a completely different approach, one that 
made it possible to enter into compromise without giving oneself up completely. During 
the  construction/renovation  works  people  had  to  make  decisions about  million  things 
concerning the design, architecture, materials, etc. BKK-2 had to deal with a group of 70

people,  everyone  having  very  strong  ideas.  But  every  concept  was  discussed with  the 
people, everything was developed in an organic way, time was devoted for every idea – 
this could have never happened in a “normal” housing project on the competitive market. 
“It  was  like  a  7-year  ongoing  housing  symposium” – remembers  one  of  the  architects 
involved  in  the  project. Because  everyone  wanted  to  know each  other,  many  of  more 
unusual  architectural  designs  could  happen  under the  premise of  communication. When 
the architects proposed to put all the balconies together, it was obvious that this solution 
will increase the intersection of everyone. But they agreed that “opening is not to eliminate 
people’s privacy, but to have the opportunity to open” (SF1: office manager, 2019). It was 
the time when they realized that the consensus was not efficient enough, so they shifted 
to a two-thirds majority. It was necessary to arrive at decisions more quickly because of 
the building deadlines. Though they still aimed to strive for consensus.  
Communication,  talking,  chatterboxes  are  the  essence  of  living  here.  From  this 
aspect,  it’s  really  like  a  “village  in  the  city”.  Everything  makes  the  rounds  very 
quickly. The laundry, the staircase, the restaurant are the main meeting points.

2.3 Values and identity 
Nowadays  Sargfabrik  has  a good reputation, people from all over the world are 
coming to visit it, study, gather ideas. “Why is there only one Sargfabrik” - they 
usually ask. Well, on one hand it was a zeitgeist phenomenon. The 80’s in Vienna 
was a time when the city government supported all kinds of fresh initiatives, bank 
loans were quite easily accessible, building sites were affordable and people were 
full  of  utopian  visions  about  how  to  develop  a  better  society.  In  the  case  of 
Sargfabrik all these things led to a co-housing model with very strong identity of 
openness  and  connection.  The  main  values  of  this  innovative  style  of  living 
(“Living-culture-integration”) are existing from the very beginning, but one special 
feature  of  Sargfabrik  is  that the  status  quo  is  never  too  long,  once  a  goal  is 
reached, several other goals are identified that invite collaboration.

2.3.1 Cultural values 
 
As  stated  in  the  project’s  motto,  cultural  values  play  a fundamental role  of 
everyday  life  in Sargfabrik.  People are  engaged  in  various  cultural  events  and 
activities, and they have lots of common spaces for these purposes. The entity has 
its   own “Kulturhaus” (https://www.sargfabrik.at/Home/Kultur/Kulturhaus), 
which has already secured a permanent place in Vienna’s cultural scene through 
its  varied  programs  and  events. With  its  high  quality  design,  programmable 
lighting and sound equipment and the flexible use of space, the room is suitable 
for  concerts,  dance  and  theatre  productions,  readings,  children’s  theatre  or 
clubbing. The  cultural  program  of  the Kulturhaus covers  a  great  variety  of 
European and non-European music, from jazz to world music and folk traditions 
from the most diverse cultures in the world. The concert hall has a capacity of 300 
people, and there is a small bar for snacks and drinks outside. Sargfabrik organizes 
about 30 concerts per year. 
The  cultural  programs for  children are  also  very  popular,  they  are a  particular 
attraction for the young audiences.  
When there is no other event, the hall can be used by community choirs to sing or 
it can be rented by music groups to rehearse.  The vast majority of the audience 
are citizens of Vienna (and not just from the neighbourhood). In Vienna the small 
concert  halls  like  this  can  get  a  subsidy  of 100,000  euros/year from  the  City 
Council. This  subsidy  plus  the  income coming  from  the tickets are  adequate  to 
balance the high performance fees and operating/maintenance expenses.

The Sargfabrik’s children house 
(https://www.sargfabrik.at/Home/Kinder/Kinderhaus) offers space for varied and 
exciting activities which strengthen the creative learning process of children. It is 
a  private  institution  subsidized by municipal funds. Although  the  kindergarten 
operates  within  the public  educational  framework,  as  a  private  institution  it  is 
maintained by the community of the Association.   
The Kindergarten has a capacity of around 60 children between ages 2 and 6. They 
are divided into three groups and supervised by trained kindergarten teachers who 
have German, Turkish and Bosnian/Croation/Serbian as their mother tongues. The 
pedagogic  principles  are  based  on  the  teachings  of  Maria  Montessori.  In  the

afternoons, after-school educational support is offered. The children have access 
to the art and craft rooms. Each week they are accompanied to the bathing house. 
They regularly visit the theatre productions in the Culture House and the seminar 
room is used for gymnastics and other activities. Children’s meals are produced in 
the Sargfabrik Café-Restaurant.

2.3.2 Social inclusion 
 
Social inclusion/integration was also part of the original mission of the project. The 
intention was – and still is – to “mirror real life” (SF3: architect, 2019). This is why 
they  are  so  concerned  with  involving  and  integrating  various  groups  of  people. 
There  are  currently  around  150  adults  and  60  children  living  in  the  112 
accommodation   units.   They   provide   space   for   a   socio-pedagogical   living 
community of the City of Vienna’s Youth and Family Offices. There are also seven 
places for disabled people and six accommodation units with limited contracts for 
tenants in need of short term housing and social housing for refugees.   
 
In Miss Sargfabrik many flats are between an area of 30 and 70m
2
, because they 
wanted to enable single parents and singles to also participate in the project. 
 
The Association also found a way to involve interested parties who could not afford living 
here. As the building is a collectively owned residential housing, no one would be eligible 
for social benefits to support rental payments or housing costs, so an internal distribution 
system  with social  fund  was created (a  fixed fee  of  27 cents  per square  metre  useable 
living area is levied for a solidarity pool). This money is distributed in the background – no 
one knows the specifics. There are two ombudsmen who allocate the money to those who 
cannot afford the rent. This is kind of an internal social transfer. Also, for those who could 
not afford it, the association has taken on part of their mortgage, or these residents pay it 
back slowly over very extended periods. There are also some social donation of people who 
lived  here  before  they  died  (one  of  them  is  a  former  Hungarian  refugee  of  the  ’56 
revolution) – these funds are also allocated for social housing. 
     
2.3.3 Solidarity economy

The Café-Restaurant Sargfabrik situated right at the entrance of the building is a 
typical pub-restaurant, functioning as an important meeting point for residents. In 
addition to the culinary purposes, it also has a social mission.  
 
As a socio-economic enterprise, they offer people over the age of 50 a temporary job in 
order to increase their professional know-how and thus their chances on the job market.  
The restaurant is operated by Der Kümmerei, the social-economic employment project of 
Job-TransFair     GmbH (https://www.bfi.wien/ueber-uns/organisation/abteilungen/job-
transfair/). It is funded by the Public Employment  Service of Vienna. This model can be 
considered as a win-win situation for all parties. The Sargfabrik community benefits from 
the services provided by the restaurant, and at the same time with its tolerant attitude 
and supportive atmosphere it is an ideal working place for these people.

2.3.4 Jobs and voluntary work 
 
An “office-style” administration is responsible for the necessary organisation and 
communication needs of the housing administration and management. At the 
moment fifteen people are employed.    
Members of  association are  actively  engaged  in  all  areas  of  communal  life. 
Communal life is greatly influenced by these important unpaid initiatives and work 
groups, like for example the planning of the legendary “Sargfabrik Ball”, looking 
after the garden, the library, organising diverse birthday celebrations and normal 
parties or running a cooking group that prepares weekly meals in the communal 
kitchen.

2.3.5 Architectural and environmental innovation 
Numerous  architectural  and  environmental  innovations  were  realized both in 
Sargfabrik and Miss Sargfabrik projects, for which they were awarded by several 
prizes. A dense, but at the same time very green architecture was realised. There 
is  a  biotope  in  the  inner  courtyard  and  a rooftop-garden.  The  method  of 
construction used energy saving technologies. A high living quality was received 
without causing additional land consumption.   
The project set new architectural standards in terms of ecological history. Large 
glass fronts with southern orientation make the 4.5 m high living rooms bright and 
transparent. Heating is with district heating via wall heating. One of the roofs is 
equipped  with  solar  collectors  for  water  heating,  the  other  with  a  spacious  roof 
garden.  
People  are  living  in  a  perimeter  block,  however,  it  really  functions  like  a 
recreational area. The courtyard within Miss Sargfabrik is like an oasis of calm, the 
dense  vegetation  provides such a  microclimate  that  eliminates  the  need  for  air 
conditioning even on the hottest summer days.  
In general it can be stated that the technical and regulatory requirements did not 
lead to compromises but raised creativity and brought innovative solutions.

2.3.6 Heritage protection 
 
“We rather look into the future, but sometimes we remember...” (SF9: Board 
member, 2019) 
“The history is alive...even if it’s a little morbid” (SF3: architect, 2019) 
Heritage protection comes in two forms: the protection of the building and the 
protection of intangible heritage.  
Today, only the layout of the new building, the still standing chimney - and the 
name Sargfabrik ("coffin factory") - are reminiscent of what was once the largest 
coffin factory in    the Austro-Hungarian monarchy – the    “Maschner 
&Söhne”. Although  the  first  designs  envisaged  the  preservation  of  the  old 
production  hall  (the  housing  units  were  to  be  placed  in  this  building),  later  it 
became clear that the old building could not be saved and it was replaced by a 
new building – preserving only the original development structure. The chimney 
still stays in the middle of the building complex, as a symbol of the past. 
Although heritage protection is admittedly not very important for the community, 
they decided to preserve the past in the name of the project. This turned out to 
be a smart decision, as it often raises the question “where does it come from” and 
then the old stories can be told.  
The community has already organized two exhibitions about the old factory, which 
attracted many visitors from the area and proved to be a great opportunity for 
collecting memories from the past and keeping the heritage alive.

2.3.7 Other values  
 
Another place that makes Sargfabrik famous is its bathing house. The bath is open 
to the community residents free of charge throughout the day, but there are also 
about 500 paid bath members. Here one can experience diverse international ways

of bathing: there is a Finnish sauna, a cold water pool, a tepidarium and a heated 
swimming pool. The bathing house is open for members 24 hours per day. Support 
is also offered for disabled bathers, and there are timeslots allocated for babies, 
small children and events organized by residents.

Miss Sargfabrik (Source: BKK-3) 
 
The housing scheme was designed by a group of young architects, BKK-2 (later 
BKK-3 http://www.bkk-3.com/).  
 
The structure of the coffin factory was not very stable, and despite the protective 
measures,  during  the  long  years  of  waiting  for  permissions  the  building  was 
increasingly subject to moisture. Because of the serious corrosion of the old wood

structure and Vienna's  strict  thermal  insulation  regulations it  seemed  a  better 
solution to build a new building. Although there are not many reserved parts, the 
architects worked hard to preserve the layout of the original factory. The central 
long-shaped pool is the main space of the former production hall. The new block 
is a completely new structure with the exception of the chimney. It took ten years 
of planning and three years of construction, and finally it was opened in 1996.   
 
At the beginning it was a bright orange building. This colour resembled the original 
red brick building of the original factory. (Unfortunately, the paints did not prove 
to be UV-resistant, so now the building has a “Manner-rose” colour.)  
 
The new Sargfabrik building is a multi-storey maisonette building. This allowed the 
architects to create rooms with various heights. Bedrooms are up to 2,25 m high, 
while the halls are of 5m heights. The units are 4,6 m wide and each of them have 
an individual balcony overlooking the courtyard. The units are placed in rows and 
can  be  accessed  from  an  external  corridor.  They  have  large  windows  facing 
southward. There is a wide choice of apartments for different family arrangements. 
The whole Sargfabrik has a flat roof with the exception of the façade facing the 
street, which has a sloped roof in order to achieve visual equity to the rest of the 
blocks. The roofs were either dotted with solar panels, or vegetation. This solution 
served two purposes: it was ecological, and it created private outdoor spaces for 
the families.

The  open  spaces  in  Sargfabrik  are  several  courtyards,  each  of  them  with  a 
communal function (gardens, playground, a small football field, etc.) 
 
      
 
Picture 12. Open spaces (picture 
made by author) 
 
The materials used were reinforced concrete and glass. The inner walls could be 
arranged according to the wish of the residents.      
 
One of the architecturally most significant novelties applied was the “box system”. 
This  means  integrating  a  half-level into the existing grid system. The  architects 
preserved the original development structure, they kept the layout of the building 
elements and the original 4.8m grid and even the unusual room height of 2.26 
meters  in  the  boxes,  which  however  also  encompass  a  double-height  space 
oriented to the south. This reflects BKK’s philosophy that “if one plans intelligently, 
then extremely low room heights in secondary spaces are acceptable if the living 
area offers sufficient volume to provide the necessary spatial differentiation”.  
 
The architects didn’t want to take any risk in designing the building.  So  first they  built  a 
1:1 testing model of the box, and the residents could test how it works for them. People 
lived there for a few days, and then the concept was accepted. One “box” (or living unit) 
comprises  of  a 45m2 space on  the  ground  floor  and an upper  mezzanine of about 
70m2. Usually a family with one or two children is living in one unit, bigger families have 
two units. The details of each interior were designed with slightly different adjustments to 
each individual's life.  
 
“I’ve heard building contractors saying an arcade is nothing more than stress and 
problems with the renters. But in our case the arcade is a delight” (SF3: architect, 
2019). 
 
Beside the chimney, the other symbol of the building is the “balcony”. This is also 
an invention of the community. At that time balconies were generally constructed 
of steel and glass, placed on the facades. Here instead uniquely shaped balconies 
and  an  arcade  was  built,  so  when  people  exit their  housing  unit,  they  are 
immediately “immersed in life”.

The concept in case of “Miss Sargfabrik” was “separated and connected”. Here the 
flats  are  much  smaller.  Instead  of  erecting  partions  and  squeezing  the  required 
floor area into a fixed order, BKK-3 separated spaces in many of the apartments 
by using abrupt changes of level in the ceiling and floor, by introducing steps and 
ramps. The units are connected to each other by a steeply upward-curving ramp.

3.2 Adaptive reuse 
“This is an urban planning of shortcuts. We have our own kindergarten, event hall, 
library,  laundry  ...  much-much more  than in  a  normal  housing” (SF3:  architect, 
2019) 
 
The  main  focus  of  the  design of adaptive reuse was communal activity. Before, 
this was a typical craft-building, with a production hall in the front and apartments 
for the workers in the back. Now it is a housing complex for living, working and 
recreation.  The  property  area  is 2747  m
2
, while  the communal  spaces  count to 
2000 m

.

The public or semi-public character of the site was an important element in the 
architectural concept. Entering the site from the Goldschlagstrasse one first passes 
a café. The access to the seminar rooms lies close to the café, they occupy the 
ground  floor  and  a  mezzanine  level.  After  the  coffee  shop  we  pass  through  a 
spacious foyer and then the bathing house. The first open space contains a large 
water basin, with the old, white painted brickwork chimney in the centre of it. The 
path  becomes  narrower  or  wider,  depending  on  the  site  boundaries.  If  we  go 
further  we  arrive  to  an  almost  square  courtyard  with  trees  and  a  green  garden

children and one football/basketball field for the bigger ones. On levels one and 
two, there are open galleries in front of each apartment.

4.1 Geographical and Demographical analysis  
Sargfabrik  is  located in  Goldschlagstrasse 169,  district  14
th
 of Vienna (Penzing). 
Penzing has an area of 34 km
2
 and a population of 92 990
2
. More than 60% of its 
area is green space, this makes Penzing the district with the second largest green 
area in Vienna. 83% of the green space is forest, but there are also around 200 
hectares of meadows and numerous streams and rivers.

The area used for transport counts only to 9% of the district area (this figure for 
the whole country is 14%), which is the second lowest value among the Viennese 
districts. The built-up area is also quite low (29%), with most of it (81%) being 
residential areas. There are 34 playgrounds and eleven large sports facilities. 
There  are  44,883  housing  units  with  an  average  size  of  72  m
2
. These units are 
placed in 12,388 buildings, out of which 7,787 were built after 1945. The average 
living space per person is 40 square meters. The share of car/person is 0.38 cars, 
and 34% of Penzinger inhabitants have an annual ticket of the Viennese Lines.  
The income in the 14th district is slightly above the Viennese average (22,233 
euros/year).  
Between 1951 and 1971 the population of Penzing remained unchanged, then 
until the 21
st
 century population losses were registered.  
Population in Penzing unchanged and registered until the beginning of the 21st. 
After 2001 the population shows a stronger growth. For the coming years a weak 
population increase (up to 3%) is expected due to the immigration from other 
parts of the country and from foreign countries.

The close neighbourhood  of  Sargfabrik is Matzner  quarter  (Matznerviertel).  The 
Matzner quarter includes the Matznerpark and Goldschlagstraße and its borders 
are Hütteldorfer Straße in the north, the Westbahn in the south, Ameisgasse in the 
west and the S-Bahn-line in the east.

The quarter has undergone through major changes in the last 20 years - from a 
former district of factories and workers it became a place of diverse uses. Originally 
there  were  houses  built  in  the  19th  century  with family  businesses  (small 
factories).  In  a  typical  building  there  were  the  housing  units  in  the  front  and 
production  halls/workshops  behind  them.  During  the  70s-80s  most  of  these 
businesses went bankrupt, so the buildings became available to purchase, to re-
build or to renovate. Most of the houses were totally torn down and new buildings 
were erected. Another  popular  solution  was  that  they  put  rooftops  on  the  old 
houses.  In  this  way,  expensive  houses  were  created,  but  due  to  the  specific 
features  of  the  housing  subsidies  in  Vienna,  these  houses  still  have  a  mixed 
population (usually people with lower income live in the basement and very rich 
people on the top).  
Nowadays, there are some attractive open spaces as well as car-dominated, noisy 
and dangerous zones. However, streets are still monotonous, the one- and two-
storey  houses  with  gardens  and  open  spaces  have been  replaced  with  higher 
buildings and the area is becoming like an ordinary big-city district. Recently an 
association was established, called the "Lebenswertes Matznerviertel", which is a 
platform   of   dedicated   residents,   entrepreneurs   and   employees   from   the 
neighborhood who are seeking to upgrade the public space in the area. Sargfabrik 
plays a crucial role in this initiative. 
When the Sargfabrik project started, this area was considered as a periphery, but 
the initiators did not mind it, since these type of sites were available only on the 
periphery  and  anyway “all  the  interesting  things  were  outside  the  downtown” 
(SF9:Board  member,  2019).  The public  transportation connections  to  the 
downtown  were  also  quite poor  at  the  beginning.  The  situation  changed 
significantly in 1998, when the U3 metro line was completed.

4.2 Policies and regulation 
The  success  of the  Sargfabrik is indivisible from the  general  housing  policy and 
urban development environment of the city of Vienna. The Viennese municipality 
uses housing development as a way to support urban renewal, urban development 
and equity within the city. These circumstances, the generous housing subsidies 
available for constructing buildings, made it possible for the Association, who did 
not receive any special support, to realize the Sargfabrik project and allowed its 
middle to lower-middle  income  members  to successfully apply  for bank  credits, 
and to complete the construction process. 
The provision of housing in Austria has traditionally been a  strongly prioritized  area 
with complex arrangements, whereby support has not only been given to social housing or 
only  to  public  stakeholders.  Rather,  a  wide  array  of  housing  arrangements have  been 
subsidized, and public authorities are involved in the process at various (national, regional 
and local) levels. Owners, private developers, the construction sector and credit institutions 
are also part of the stakeholder system. Regarding the financing, spending on housing and 
other aspects of urban planning has been overwhelming financed  by national resources. 
The specific subsidy forms have changed over the years, but construction subsidies, direct 
subsidies and even tax breaks are among the forms, although the latter to a smaller extent. 
Importantly, privately rented, owner occupied dwellings receive subsidies as well, creating 
a  well-functioning  and  inclusive  market  for  affordable  housing  for  people  with  different 
income levels, where the income threshold is set so high that it is way above the poverty 
line. This has been a key to the creation of social mix in municipal and subsidized buildings. 
(Reinprecht 2007) 
 
The municipality is very proud of its achievements, and it clearly states that “The 
City of Vienna is known for its special focus on social dimension in urban housing 
far beyond mere economic criteria.”  (Magistrat der Stadt Wien 2016) As a result, 
in Vienna more than 60 per cent of the residents live in homes that are in some 
way subsidized. About half of the units, approximately 220,000, are owned directly 
by  the municipal  housing  company, Wiener  Wohnen,  which  is as  a  result the 
biggest public landlord in Europe. There are approximately another 200,000 that 
are owned by associations and cooperatives and receive subsidies from the public 
sector for maximizing their rents. (Ball 2019; Makris 2018) 
Alternative  housing  projects, similar  to  the  Sargfabrik  can  thrive under  the 
conditions created by the City of Vienna. On the one hand there are the socially 
sensitive and socially responsible housing projects, like the ones carried out in the 
framework  of the HabiTAT group (https://habitat.servus.at/?page_id=608).  The 
group has three projects (two established and one in the making) in Vienna, and 
they  all specifically  target  people  interested  in  innovative,  communal  housing 
solutions.    HabiTAT follows the    example and   model of    the    German 
Miethäusersyndikat,  does  so  by lowering  the  expenses,  and  creating  a financial 
model,  where  collaborating  and  sustainable  living  arrangements  are  within  the

reach of lower income households.

 Furthermore, Vienna is also full of initiatives 
also for the middle-classes, often-led by architectural firms, that try to establish a 
more community-centered and sustainable living style in the city.
4
 
An area, where these initiatives are abundant is Aspern Seestadt, the site of a big 
municipal-led urban development project that tries to create a futuristic city in the 
fringes of Vienna. A city within the city, but reachable with public transportation, 
Aspern Seestadt is expected to provide housing for approximately 20.000 by 2028, 
matched by equal number of workplaces. It is a political project not only in a sense 
that the city tries to realise many of the smart city ideas conceived, but also that 
it supports community development, identity building and sustainability together.
5
  
Finally, identity building and urban development as supported by the municipality’s 
policies are  also  exemplified  by  the  rebuilding  and  redevelopment  of  the 
Kabelwerk
6
 area. The  first  of  its  kind  done  by  the  municipality  of  Vienna,  that 
redevelopment process took place between 2004 and 2010. In many ways there 
is a close resemblance to what happened in case of the Sargfabrik, but the scale 
was much bigger. The activities meant the complete transformation of a desolate 
industrial area, but while keeping the intangible heritage alive and maintaining the 
identity.  Today  home  to  approximately  a  thousand  new  dwellings available  for 
people   with   mixed   incomes   through   the   different   subsidy   systems,   the 
development treasured identity  and  local  history,  and took  place in  close 
cooperation with the local community. Serving as an example for developments to 
come later, the realisation was preceded by years of collective work, starting as 
early  as  1996. This  long  process,  just  like  in  case  of  the  Sargfabrik, allowed all 
stakeholders to find appropriate and satisfying solutions.  
 
5 The model 
5.1 “Wohnheim” 
One key aspect of the Sargfabrik project was defining the building as “Wohnheim” 
(dorm, or residential home). The Association (VIL) acts as the owner, constructor, 
operator and rental agency of the housing complex. 
 
 
                                       
3
 This is an important goal, as the collaborative projects tend to be inhabitated by better 
off and more educated residents. See among others the article by Jakobsen and Larsen 
(2018) on the Danish co-housing scene. 
4
 For these projects it is a good start to look at the webpage https://www.einszueins.at/, 
that showcases some examples delivered by a local architectural firm. 
5
 Among the sign of the conscious identity building are the street names – they are 
named after women. For more details, see Hunt 2019.

Initially, the Wohnheim  model was  designed for  student  accommodation or homes for 
elderly. By the Sargfabrik project this model has been adopted for the purpose of living 
collectively and turned into a sort of cooperative within the gramework of Viwnnese housing 
provision.  This  specific  organizational  legal  form  provides  a  resident  group  access  to 
housing subsidies, yet only for the construction and not for housing allowances. Moreover, 
the Wonheim offers a number of exclusions from the general building regulations. These 
exceptions from several building codes contribute to lower building costs that could be re-
invested into the social infrastructure of the project.  
Through the choice of this legal form special subsidies of the city of Vienna could 
be   claimed for   educational,   social   and   cultural   activities (WWBF,   Wiener 
Wohnbauförderung). Other  advantage  of  this  solution  is  that  many  building 
regulations  do  not  count.  Operators  were  allowed  to  build  for  example  parking 
facilities in the proportion of 1:10 instead of the 1:1 rule (meaning that they one 
car park for ten households). Instead of building an underground car park, they 
saved money for communal facilities. Three out of 11 car parks are now used for 
car-sharing, the rest is filled with bicycles. As tenants stressed out, they did not 
need so many parking places, because even at the very beginning they preferred 
to use bicycles.    
This model also allowed the share of public operating space up to 25%. 
This  model also  raises  some  so-called  “security  aspects”  related  to  owning  a 
property.  This type of security is not present in such a rental-apartment project 
where no ownership is involved. However, residents feel that in a way this model 
still make them owners. They  possess  a  large  piece  of  valuable  real  estate  and 
there is an agreement about how they can retrieve the equity they have invested. 
So  Association  members  do  not  consider  collective  ownership  as  an  unsecure 
venture. Moreover,  they  see  Sargfabrik  rather as an  enterprise,  in  contrast  to 
conventional housing, holding both entrepreneurial and proprietorial responsibility.  
“We are interested in people that keep the spirit of the project – it works like this 
because people put their heart and soul in it” (SF9: Board member, 2019). 
Through this model the Association can keep control over the “spirit” of the project.  
There are very strict rules and a complex scanning process for those who want to 
move in.  
 
5.2 Organizational structure 
Sargfabrik is the biggest self-administered housing and cultural project in Austria. 
The  association  members  live  in  the  flats  and  their  rights  and  obligations  are 
detailed in an internal contract, like in a cooperative. The members pay a “rent”, 
most of which goes for the repayment of the mortgage. They also contribute to 
the administrative and maintenance costs of the building (operation of the bathing 
house  and  the  institutions,  contribution  to  the  social  fund,  etc.). In  the  case  of 
moving out, members return the flat to the association.

Because of the autonomous status of the Association, over the years occupants 
could take  over  a  lot  of  responsibilities  and  were allowed  to  participate  in  the 
planning  process.  For  instance,  they  could  influence  the architecture plans,  the 
materials used, the inside design - so each flat has its own style.  
The association  has a  special model  of  households  and  builders.  From  the  very 
beginning,  two  architects  of  BKK-2  were  part  of  the  group  which  initiated  the 
project, they are members of the Association and they live in Sargfabrik. The office 
of BKK-3 is situated in Miss Sargfabrik. The participatory planning with the addition 
of the personal incentives and involvement of the architects resulted in a design 
process which is quite unusual on the competitive market.    
The project has a professional project management team consisting of 16 people 
(two  Association  members  are  full-time  employees  of  this  team),  with  a 
responsible  person  for  each  branch  of  activity (facility  management,  public 
relations, culture house, kindergarten, bathing house, seminar room, etc.) 
Important  decisions,  such  as  statutes,  standing  orders,  business  plan,  annual 
planning, budget, flat allocation, rules of use etc. are discussed twice a year on 
the General Assembly. The general assembly elects six board members (they are 
acting on voluntary basis). The Board appoints a professional executive director 
for implementing the yearly work plans and managing all departments. In order to 
keep the discussions focused, the Board prepares the proposals very thoroughly 
before presenting them to the GA. The decision-making is supported by the trust 
between the members, on the principle that “no one works for its own benefit” 
(SF9: Board member, 2019).  
Beside  the two  big  General  Assemblies  there  are  around  ten-twelve  smaller 
meetings a year focusing on particular issues.

5.3 Financing 
The financing of the project had two major elements: purchasing the site and 
financing the building costs. The price of the size was 1 million euro. This was 
financed by a mortgage, but in a very special way. The original community 
contributed with 250.000 euro (35 people were involved in this action, each of 
them payed around 7300 euro - ca. 100.000 schilling that time). This was the 
collateral for the loan, as the Association itself had no money that time. The 
maturity of the loan was 25 years. 
The total construction costs amounted to 13,6 million euro. This was financed from 
three sources: (1) the Association received an 5,8 million euro support from the 
City  of  Vienna (Wohnbauförderungsmittel) – those  days  any  Wohnheim-type 
project was eligible for this grant; (2) a long-term bank loan of 5,3 million euro 
(with 20 years maturity – by now this is already paid back by the association) and 
(3) 2,5 million euros as the own contribution of the owners 
7
(the “equity”). In 1995 
this  was  660euro/sqm,  but  according  to  the  indexing  process  applied  by  the 
Association, the value of the equity in 2016 was around 1000 euro/sqm.       
As Sargfabrik is not just a residential building, but a professional NGO, they also 
have incomes and expenditures related to the services they provide. As they are 
a non-profit organization,  they  make  only  very  little  turnover.  For  most  of  their 
activities they get support from the City of Vienna or the Federal government, but 
they also generate income from fees (kindergarten, cultural house, seminar room, 
etc.). 
The level of the rents is quite low, especially considering the facilities available for 
the inhabitants. The total amount of the rent is around 8,45 euro/sqm, which is 
half of the rent paid in the neighbouring houses. Around 30% of the rent goes for 
the repayment of the loan, the rest covers some general costs of the building (the 
operation  of  the  bathing  house,  insurance,  hot  water  and  heating,  institution 
support, renovation fund, social fund and maintenance costs).    
 
6 Impacts 
Long waiting lists 
The “Sargfabrik” is a special model for urban housing. Its success can be proven 
by  very  long  waiting  lists. Currently  around  600  people  are  on  the  waiting  list, 
being interested to move into Sargfabrik. In fact, there is rarely any vacancy in 
                                       
7
 This amount was on top of the 7300 euros per person they already contributed to the 
collateral

Sargfabrik.   People are usually emotionally   attached   to   this   building   and 
community, and they live here until they die. In Miss Sargfabrik, due to the lower 
size of the apartments (and kind of a lower reputation), the fluctuation is higher.  
Those, who want to live in the Sargfabrik have to fill in a questionnaire, and then 
they  are  scanned  by  a  group  formed  of  Association  members.  The  potential 
newcomers are usually asked the questions “Why do you want to live here” and 
“Why do you think we want you to live here”? 
Bringing vitality to the neighbourhood 
The Bathing House, the Concert Hall, the kindergarten, the open cultural events 
and the  lifestyle  represented  by  this  community turned  out  to  be  very  popular 
attractions in the District and vitalised the surroundings (especially the very close 
surrounding,  the  Matzner  quarter). Programs  and  facilities  at  Sargfabrik  are 
provided for all age groups. Also, some members of the Association are actively 
involved and play a leading role in the revitalization of Matzner district.

Gentrification 
“We cannot buy any site here, because the success of our project. We grew up 
our own gentrification project” (SF3: architect, 2019) 
Twenty years ago, the west of Vienna was still a factory district of workers, and 
Sargfabrik was the first project to bring the concept of experimental living. Today, 
there  are  many  high-quality  residential  groups  nearby,  so  the  self-organized 
business model has also led many new communities that are effective in organizing 
themselves and bringing vitality into the area. Now everybody is advertising the 
area with the Sargfabrik project, and the sites in the neighbourhood became quite 
expensive.

Trendsetting model 
Sargfabrik is not just a building  for living, but also for meeting, communication, 
recreation. It became a trendsetting model for an urban and modern way of living. 
It  has  hundreds of  visitors  every  year:  students,  architects, living  communities, 
experts of housing and social activities are all interested in the projects and the 
keys  of  success.  Asking many people  living  in  the building  complex,  the  answer 
was  always  the  same:  “the  key  of  success  is  people,  open  communication  and 
collaboration.”   
 
7 Future challenges 
“Back then, people had little money and lots of ideas. Now, they have much more 
money...but still many ideas” (SF9: Board member, 2019) 
One of the specifics of the project is that it is never completed, there are always 
new goals, new ideas, new challenges. Seven years ago there was a GA dedicated 
to  “The  future  of  Sargfabrik”,  where  a  record  number  of  Association  members 
showed  up  to  re-think  the  future  and  develop  new  project  ideas. Another  big 
meeting with the focus on the future is planned for November 2019.  
One of the most urgent issues is to think about how to finance the building when 
it gets older, how to keep it in good condition.  
It is also the moment, when the interest of the Association is different than the 
interest  of  the  individual  people.  The  Association  also  need  to  look  at  the  big 
picture. Most of the original inhabitants are getting old, their children left, but they 
still live in big apartments and do not want to move out. The Association is trying 
to find an adequate solution which serves everyone’s satisfaction. 
It also needs to be considered how they can change their regulations to avoid that 
those who want to stay pay the part of those who want to move out. As mentioned 
earlier,  when  someone  leaves,  the Association  has  to  pay  back their personal 
equity. At  the  beginning  the created  a  system  where  interest  is  paid  on  the 
personal   equities.   Normally, the interest should be   discounted with   the 
depreciation of the apartment. However, they wanted to encourage the growth of 
the personal equity. The idea was that the property would accrue value and that 
everyone should profit from this added value. But they did not consider that the 
building is naturally aging and there will be a need for new infusion of funds to 
renovate it. This was an error in planning. 
The Sargfabrik model doesn’t provide security for the youth either. When the first 
generation moved in, there were several children of similar age. They could get 
together on a daily basis, they were raised among adults with different behavioural 
pattern  and  different  lifestyles,  but  always  in  a  very  supportive  ambiance. 
However,  the  youth  cannot  afford  to  stay  here  because  their  parents  are  not 
allowed to pass on the apartment to them. The apartments cannot be inherited. If

they want to live here, they would have to go through the screening process as 
anyone from the outside.   
During  the  mentioned  GA,  the  Association  discussed  17  new  project  ideas, 
including activities to reduce the ecological footprint of the building. to solve the 
situation   of   the   inhabitants   getting   older,   and   also   to   strengthen   the 
embeddedness of  the  community  into  the  neighbourhood.  In  fact,  there  is  a 
consensus that many things have been achieved inside Sargfabrik, now it is time 
to think about how the surroundings could and should be improved. VIL members 
would  like  to play  a  pro-active  role  in revitalizing  the  neighbourhood  through  a 
participatory process.

Executive summary 
Färgfabriken is  a  platform  and  exhibition  venue  for  contemporary  cultural 
expressions, with an emphasis on art, architecture and urban planning established 
in  an  industrial  building built in  1889.  The  building  previously  accommodated  a 
paint factory, from which it also borrowed its name. Färgfabriken is run as/by a 
foundation and was founded in 1995 by Alcro-Beckers AB, ColArt Sweden AB (both 
owned  by Lindéngruppen,  a  private  industrial  company)  and SAR (Swedish 
Association of Architects). Since its creation, Färgfabriken has not only become a 
key cultural institution in Stockholm, but has also pioneered a model of building 
inclusive,  participatory  processes  through  art  and  dialogue. Through  a  cultural 
agenda that conciliates architecture, arts and urban planning with contemporary 
societal issues, Färgfabriken remains a significant actor in Stockholm, with a great 
impact on the development of the surrounding area and on the inclusion of a great 
variety of stakeholders in decision-making processes.

2 The story of the building  
Färgfabriken’s building was built in 1889 in Lövholmen, an industrial zone in 
Southwest Stockholm, by Helge Palmcrantz. The Palmcrantz House, as it was 
called at the time, was specifically designed to accommodate the reaping 
machine, mower and machine gun production of the Palmcrantz company. In 
1902, the paint firm Wilhelm Becker moved its production in the building, leaving 
a more central area of Stockholm that became unsuitable for industrial 
production. In 1974, Ulf G. Lindén became managing director of Beckers and in 
1985 his company Lindéngruppen, focusing on the long-term development of 
industrial companies, became owner of Beckers; this ownership also included the 
company’s properties in Lövholmen.  
Ulf G. Lindén and the Lindéngruppen were key protagonists in the creation of 
Färgfabriken. When the paint factory discontinued its production, the art-lover

Lindén began to make plans for a cultural venue. In 1994, when discussions 
began between a group of artists and architects and Beckers, the building was 
abandoned, practically a ruin, with its walls standing but without a roof and with 
trees growing inside the main hall.  
“This was just a ruin. The wall was there, this iron construction in the main 
hall was intact, but there was no roof. Just a ruin. Beckers said we can 
take over, use it for free, if we can find a sponsor for reconstruction. I 
thought this would be a suicide mission but we understood that it is 
architecturally an amazing space.” Thomas Lundh

3 The initiative 
“We  presented  an  idea  to  do  something  else,  between  contemporary  art, 
fashion, design, architecture, at the same time be very open for partnership.

That time when you were a painter or an artist you didn’t want to work with 
other companies. It was unusual at that time. It was in the papers that we 
sold our soul.” Thomas Lundh  
Färgfabriken  (“paint  factory”  in  English)  was  created  in  1995,  as  a  result of 
collaboration between the Association of Swedish Architects (Svenska Arkitekters 
Riksförbund), Alcro-Beckers, ColArt and a group of artists and architects. In the 
1990s,  the  paint  company  Beckers,  owner  of  an  empty  industrial  building  in 
Lövholmen,  was interested  in  building  collaboration  with  architects,  in  order  to 
open  up  a  new  market  for  its  products.  Coincidentally,  a  group  of  artists  and 
architects including Jan Åman, Thomas Lundh and Elizabeth Hatz had been for long 
discussing the idea to open a space for art activities and reflection on architecture 
and contemporary art. Through Elizabeth Hatz, then chairwomen of the Association 
of Swedish Architects, these two ambitions met and the group visited the building 
in Lövholmen.  
“For  Beckers,  it  was  not  so  much  about  collaboration  between  different 
fields,  architects  and  other  partners.  This  company,  producing  paint,  just 
wanted  to  reach  out  to  architects  because  they  saw  the  construction 
industry as a big market for them.” Thomas Lundh  
 
Beckers offered the use of the building for free, if the group finds a sponsor for the 
building’s  renovation.  Beckers’  plan  on  the  longer  term  was  to  demolish  the 
building. However, with pressure from the artists, the building received heritage 
protection  from  the  municipality.  The  artists’  involvement  and  their  capacity  to 
bring  in  funds  convinced  Beckers.  In  1995,  a  foundation  was  created  with  the 
participation  of  Alcro-Beckers  (still  owner  of  the  building),  ColArt  and  the 
Association  of  Swedish  Architects,  with  Alcro-Beckers  taking  a  more  important 
role. 
“It was a philanthropy issue, but not only that. We knew that the questions 
we discussed here both within architecture and society we can use in our 
business because it opens up ideas and gets another perspective of things. 
It helps us think about the future and where our businesses can develop.” 
Joacim Björk 
Färgfabriken opened in May 1995 with the exhibition Triangular, bringing together 
artists from Sweden, Mexico and Guatemala, funded by international development 
aid funds. Färgfabriken’s second exhibition, Interpol gave the organisation nation-
wide visibility in 1996. It was a group exhibition, but the most memorable event 
of the opening was a performance by Oleg Kulik, a Russian artist: he acted as a 
dog on a chain and losing control of his performance, he bit the leg of the vice-
Sponsorship: Lindéngruppen’s role in facilitating the creation of Färgfabriken 
is due to the engagement of Ulf G. Lindén, its former owner. When the building 
in Lövholmen stopped its paint production, Ulf G. Lindén, inspired by his love for 
art, decided to use the space to create a cultural venue. While Lindéngruppen’s 
sponsorship  is  a  philanthropic  gesture  and  a  continuation  of  the  company’s 
engagement with arts through the Beckers Art Award, Färgfabriken as a cultural 
venue  could  also  help  the  company  reach  out  to  new  fields and  explore  new 
ideas for its own development. In the meanwhile, the creation of a foundation 
and  the  separation  of  Färgfabriken’s  daily  operations  from  the  company  also 
ensured the curatorial independence of the new cultural centre.

mayor for culture who opened the exhibition. Director Jan Åman called the police 
and  the  next  day  the  incident  was  covered  by  all  media  outlets,  creating  an 
immediate visibility for Färgfabriken.  
“Färgfabriken became famous as a free space: not managed by the city or 
the   government,   it   was   a   non-religious,   non-political   and   non-profit 
foundation.” Pernilla Lesse  
In  the  meanwhile,  in  parallel  with  its  art  exhibitions, Färgfabriken  began  to 
organise seminars about architecture and urban planning and received additional 
funding  from  the  municipality  to  run  activities  discussing  the  future  of  the 
Lövholmen area. In the first years, Färgfabriken has developed partnership with a 
variety  of  ministries,  municipal  agencies  as  well  as  embassies  and  private 
companies and also began to attract a wider audience.  
“It was quite new for a cultural institution to have very open, transparent 
collaboration with partners not used to work with the cultural field. And for 
that we got lot of criticism, mostly from the traditional cultural field, that we 
were not serious, that we were mixing money with culture.” Thomas Lundh 
Färgfabriken’s breakthrough was partly due to a lack of competition in the cultural 
scene of the Swedish capital. The city was poorly equipped with art centres and a 
temporary cultural vacuum created by the construction of the new building of the 
Moderna Museet gave an opportunity to Färgfabriken to create a new position in 
this scene. In a context with a few art institutions owned by the state, the city or 
private  banks,  Färgfabriken  was  conceived  as  a  free  place  where  more  open 
discussions can be held with no external control. In 1998, Stockholm was European 
Capital  of  Culture  and  Färgfabriken,  as its  main  partner,  became  internationally 
known. In 2001, Lindéngruppen sold Alcro-Beckers, the decorative paints business 
of  Beckers  to  the  Finnish  company  Tikkurilla but  kept  the  ownership  of  the 
Färgfabriken building.  
“When Lindéngruppen sold Alcro-Beckers, we were very nervous that they 
would also sell this building. But they kept the building and continued to 
support the foundation. It was very important for them.” Thomas Lundh 
Färgfabriken  defined  itself  as  a  Kunsthalle,  different  in  its  activities  from  art 
museums  or  art  galleries.  Building  its  unique  profile  among art institutions,  the 
organisation also refused to join the star system of art and architecture, and focus 
on  emerging  artists  and  creators  instead  of  established  stars.  By  opening  up 
towards  a  variety  of  collaborators,  many  actors  were  invited  to  contribute  and 
shape the organisation. 
 
In the early 2000s, a few exhibitions brought a paradigm shift to Färgfabriken. The 
exhibition Stockholm  at  Large, organised  in  2001,  can  be  identified  as  one  of 
Färgfabriken’s main turning points. The event brought together urban planners, 
project managers and students, to look at the city from a distance. For the first 
Kunsthalle: In the founding documents Färgfabriken is defined as a Kunsthalle 
for contemporary arts and architecture with a focus on creating a communication 
platform for local stakeholders through the making of workshops and seminars. 
As a Kunsthalle, Färgfabriken is a space for art exhibitions that, according to the 
definition, distinguishes itself from an art museum by the lack of a permanent 
collection and from a gallery by the lack of commercial activity.

time in Sweden, such a diverse group of local stakeholders came together to work 
on issues concerning the development of the city of Stockholm and various towns 
in the metropolitan agglomeration began to talk to  each other.  The  participants 
were  asked  to  approach  the  city  through  the  use  of  a  giant  map,  specifically 
created for the occasion. The working session revolved around the question “What 
would  happen  if  300,000  more  people  moved  to  Stockholm?”  Participants  were 
mixed up in thematic groups and were asked to look at different issues relevant to 
the analysis of the city and the projection of its development. A dramatic situation 
of urban segregation rapidly came out. For the first time, Stockholm was defined 
as   a   very   segregated   city,   with   little   communication   among   different 
neighbourhoods.  The  results  of  this  participatory  workshop  were  so  unexpected 
that it immediately got the media attention. The public reaction was so loud and 
enthusiastic that the initiative got very well known in the Stockholm and its model 
of  bringing  together  different  stakeholders  was  labelled  as  “the Färgfabriken 
method” and was brought forward in various cities in the framework of the New 
Urban Topologies series.   
“We  divided  people  into  seven  groups,  and  in  each  group  we  invited 
stakeholders  with  different  backgrounds  to  collaborate.  We  had  urban 
planners,   project   managers   from   companies   and  students   who   were 
gathering  together  in  mixed  groups.  To  avoid  the  deadlock  of  everyday 
discussions,  we  put  the  scenario  into  the  future  of  Stockholm,  40  years 
ahead of us.” Joachim Granit  
Building upon the media attention created by Färgfabriken’s early activities, the 
success of the European Capital of Culture season and Stockholm at Large ensured 
that  Färgfabriken  would  soon  become  a  national  cultural  brand.  Later  on, 
Färgfabriken’s profile has further expanded with some other experiments. In 2010, 
the  exhibition Building  Blocks invited  children  to  commission  architects  to  build 
their  dream  houses  at  a  1:1  scale.  The  exhibition,  giving voice  to  children  in 
shaping the urban environment, was a great success and was later invited to a 
variety  of  countries.  In  2012-13,  the  event  series Stockholm  on  the  Move 
examined questions  about  the  development  of  the  city  of  Stockholm. In  2015, 
Experiment Stockholm created a laboratory to address the challenges of the rapidly 
growing Stockholm region.  
“We need to aim towards the future and use our amassed knowledge and 
experience as a force to go forward. We have to be at the forefront of where 
a cultural institution can be, to challenge the status quo and get new ideas, 
being this platform where different worlds and interests come together as 
they have not done before.” Joacim Björk  
4 The Färgfabriken method  
Following  Stockholm  at  Large  and  its  other  events  focusing  on  urbanism, 
Färgfabriken soon became a reference point for community groups experiencing 
dynamics  of  segregation  and  exclusion  in  their  neighbourhood  in  Stockholm. 
Accordingly, the foundation developed an expertise in organizing exhibitions and 
workshops  exploring  issues  relevant  to  the  surrounding  urban  context,  inviting 
inhabitants and local stakeholders to participate. The methodology rapidly came 
to be known as the Färgfabriken method, referring to the organisation’s approach

to build interdisciplinary dialogue around urban challenges. Although participatory 
and multidisciplinary focus groups might sound like a common practice in today’s 
urban planning and management, Stockholm at Large caught the Stockholm public 
opinion  by  surprise  at  the  time.  The  events  triggered  a  broad  interest  in 
collaborative ways of working on urban challenges.  
“In  a  way  we  are  a  think-tank.  We  think  it  is  very  important  for  the 
development of our future cities and societies to be able to find other angles 
that help tricky questions emerge.” Joachim Granit 
Färgfabriken’s success is explained by the innovative and intriguing take that the 
model  has  on  societal  issues.  The  Färgfabriken  method  explores  in  different, 
unexpected  and  innovative  ways  how  to  approach  complex  issues  by  putting  in 
place an interdisciplinary and participatory strategy for problem resolution, using 
art as a starting point and referring to other disciplines such as urban planning and 
architecture  in  a  collaborative  work  including  a  variety  of  stakeholders,  among 
which the local inhabitants.  
“We  developed  a  model  that  finds  its  strength  in  being  an  open  platform 
where  different  parties  from  society  can  meet  around  societal  issues  in  a 
creative  way,  being  in  the  same  room  as  they  never  come  together 
otherwise. That is the most exciting part. Färgfabriken is not an art gallery. 
It’s a platform for culture, art and architecture that makes discussing and 
generating new ideas societal issues wonderfully possible.” Elizabeth Hatz  
One of the characterising elements of Färgfabriken relies on the ability of invited 
artists to work in synergistic relation with Färgfabriken, contributing to the making 
of a better cultural agenda, according to an inclusive, collaborative and transparent 
decision-making process.  Thus,  the  model is  not  based  on  the  popularity  of  the 
guest artist or expert, but rather on the concept of continuity, aiming at developing 
exhibitions  and  projects  that  stem  from  a  diverse  group  of  people  sharing  a 
common  vision.  Such  an  approach  is  favourable  to  the  development  of  strong 
collaborations,  triggering  a  much  more  consistent  and  long-term  local impact, 
avoiding ephemeral projects that vanish soon.  
“As a cultural institution you can support fancy art but you need to support 
important ideas.” Joachim Granit 
 
“We create these platforms where people can interact without being in the 
usual  roles  of  client  and  municipality.  They  can  be  in  a  creative  process 
because  they  have  some  knowledge  about  the  city  or  urban  planning,  or 
something relevant to the project. It unlocks many ideas.” Karin Englund 
 
 
The Färgfabriken  method is  the  realisation  of  the  founders’  vision  for  the 
cultural  institution  with  events  and  exhibitions  helping  to  discuss  important 
societal  issues.  Involving  a  variety  of  stakeholders,  organising  workshop 
situations  to  create  exchange  between  different  positions, mediating  between 
different professional and laic languages and supporting such discussions with 
exhibitions   and   artistic   research   has   become   a   trademark   format   of 
Färgfabriken’s projects. The art context has proven to be fruitful for discussions, 
liberating ideas and enabling empathy instead of confrontation.

5 The area  
 
Picture 3. Färgfabriken in Stockholm. Image by Jorge Mosquera 
In  the  1990s,  while  most  of  Stockholm  was  under  construction,  the  Lövholmen 
area was a “white spot” on the map. Although the area had been an industrial site 
for  over  one  hundred  years  and  remained  such  until  2009,  the  traces  of  the 
industrial crisis were visible already in 1995, and after working hours the area was 
frequented by drug dealers and prostitutes.   
 “People in the beginning told us we are stupid, no one could come this area, 
especially in the evening. When we had bigger events here, we accompanied 
female staff to the metro. Nothing happened but it was a very uncomfortable 
feeling.” Thomas Lundh 
The   area   surrounding   Färgfabriken   was   gradually   provided   with   basic 
infrastructure such as decent lighting and a school. Following the introduction of 
basic  but  essential public  services,  it  was  increasingly  easy  to  attract  people  to 
Färgfabriken and the Lövholmen area. Moreover, the major urban changes going 
on in the city at the time also ignited an interest to regenerate the area. In the 
2000s, Stockholm was going through many changes and the introduction of new 
environmental regulations paved the way for the remaining industrial activities to 
be progressively relocated further away from the city. As a practical arrangement,

once industries have left Lövholmen, landowners began to offer buildings to artists 
and designers, protecting their properties from vandalism and attracting a critical 
mass of art and design activities in the area.  Recognising this transformation, local 
authorities  also  started  to  support  individual  artists  with  studio  grants  and 
Färgfabriken with funding for activities.  
“There is something about the potential of this area, like  a  blank  piece  of 
paper, like a canvass. It’s like a magnet for ideas.” Jan Rydén 
Partly  as a  result  of  Färgfabriken’s  attractiveness,  this  previously  industrial and 
abandoned area was hit by a big wave of change, a kind of an unplanned cultural 
revolution. Although a big part of the area is still left abandoned, the presence of 
Färgfabriken and of other small art studios that slowly settled in the surroundings 
suggests  a  particular  vision  for  the  future  development  of  the  neighbourhood. 
Plans for the area, currently in the state of a suspended construction site, depict 
predominantly  residential  complexes,  threatening  the  survival  of  the  cultural 
initiatives that have settled there. Färgfabriken, together with other actors in the 
area  have  been  promoting  the  idea  of  an  organisation  to  manage  ground  floor 
spaces and establish a mix of art and commercial spaces.  
“With the right actor you can create a model that would give some hipness 
for the commercial developer, and studio spaces for the artists. Otherwise 
they  would  be  just  thrown  out  and  the  area  would  become  a  sanitised 
version of what you have now.” Jan Rydén

6 Adaptive reuse and heritage  
In  the  mid-1990s,  Färgfabriken  was  basically  locked  in  a  guarded  site,  for  the 
surrounding  industries  were  still  working.  It  was  dangerous  even  to  smoke  a 
cigarette outside, for chemicals were everywhere in the air. Moreover, the area 
was not at all connected with the city centre and it suffered from a lack of basic 
services  and  an  overall  decadent  environment  often  linked  to  drug  abuse  and 
poverty.  However,  the  building  had  quite  a  charming  character  and  the  team 
accepted the challenge to start working there after the first renovation in 1995.  
“When I stood in front of Färgfabriken for the first time I said - wow, it has 
an incredible character! - with its low façade, the way in which the building 
meets  the  water  and  the  topography  of  the  big  stone  wall.  The  building 
looked so robust.” Elizabeth Hatz 
When discussions began between the paint firm Beckers and the groups of artists, 
the building was in such a bad shape that on the longer run, Beckers wanted to 
demolish it. The building was lacking a lot of basic amenities: it had a dirt floor, 
no toilets, no system for ventilation, no heating or hot water and its roof was open. 
The  artists  who  nevertheless  recognised  the  building’s  value  were  reluctant  to 
accept the building’s fate and contacted the municipality’s  heritage department, 
asking for protection for the building. The department understood the danger of 
demolition and acted quickly, moving the building under heritage protection.  
“We  were  very  lucky.  We  had  the  building,  we  had  access  to  the 
building, we  had  the  decision  from  the  authorities  that  it  has  to  be 
saved.” Thomas Lundh  
Through  their  contacts  at  the  Association  of  Swedish  Architects,  the  initiators 
approached  Skanska,  the  large  construction  company  active  in  the  area,  and 
received 600,000 Swedish crowns that allowed a basic renovation of the building: 
restoring  the  roof,  opening  the  water  system,  levelling  the  floors  and  installing 
heating in some of the spaces. The renovation itself was quite a simple and humble 
action,  designed  by  architects Catharina  Gabrielsson and Staffan  Henriksson, 
specialised in industrial architecture. The idea was to make as little renovation as 
possible, supporting the building and not making fancy things out of it. After the 
first  renovation,  although it  was already  suitable  for work,  the  building was  still 
quite  uncomfortable  and  unwelcoming,  with  its  cold  spaces.  Nevertheless, 
Färgfabriken’s raw industrial spaces were an important part of its success.  
“If you are a civil servant, you are used to sitting in a controlled 
environment, a narrow framework. When you come here in this run-down, 
industrial setting, you are part of this crazy architecture exhibition, there 
are artists in the room, you are allowed to think much more freely. You 
have a license to speak more freely.” Jan Rydén  
It was more than 10 years later, that the second renovation turned the building 
into  a  state-of-the-art  cultural  venue.  Following  the  leadership  change  in  the 
foundation  in  2009,  Lindéngruppen  stepped  in,  stabilised  Färgfabriken’s  budget 
and financed the renovation of the building to upgrade the organisation’s facilities. 
This second renovation was designed by Petra Gipp and was finished in 2011. As 
a result, the atmosphere of the building has been altered, it became posher. The 
ground floor gave space to a new restaurant, adding to the financial stability of 
Färgfabriken.

Färgfabriken’s  most  important  space is  its large  main  hall at  the  1
st
 floor  of  the 
building, characterised by monumental pillars and a raw factory interior, used as 
the institution’s central exhibition space. Next the main hall, two smaller project 
rooms give space for smaller exhibitions and workshops. The same floor also hosts 
a shop selling books, catalogues and artefacts related to the institution’s cultural 
programme and the office of the Färgfabriken staff. At  the  top  floor, a  spacious 
and bright loft space hosts a variety of events, talks, workshops and occasionally, 
is  rented  out  for  private  events.  The  ground  floor,  besides  the  building’s  main 
entrance, accommodates the Färgfabriken Kafé and an additional event space.  
The  Färgfabriken  building  is  protected  and  cannot  be  demolished  or  altered 
externally. The renovation had a fundamental role in the protection of the site from 
demolition.  The  authorities  were  quite  responsive  to  the  need  for  industrial 
heritage  protection  and  immediately  accepted  to  collaborate,  allowing  the 
renovation to happen. The presence of strong heritage protection policies was very 
helpful  to  the  creation  of  the  foundation. Besides  protecting  its  building, 
Färgfabriken has been acting as a catalyst of debates about and different visions 
for  Lövholmen,  engaged  in  the  broader  discussion  about  the  area’s  future,  the 
preservation of its industrial character 
“Our vision is to keep much of the historical value of the area. It has so 
much industrial and cultural history, these are things that should be part of 
the future of the area and not be replaced by a sterile space.” Karin 
Englund

7 Community involvement 
Once Färgfabriken was launched and its building renovated, the biggest challenge 
of the organisation was to make people interested in the activities happening there 
and motivate them to reach an area they would not have gone to otherwise. The 
media coverage resulting from the success of Färgfabriken’s events and exhibitions 
was definitely helpful in attracting a bigger audience.  
“It  is  as  if  we  were  in  a  no-go  zone  and  would  still  have  an  audience.” 
Joachim Granit  
Among  factories  already  abandoned  or  about  to  close,  Färgfabriken  has  been  a 
catalyst to attract new initiatives in the area and build relationships with them. 
Continuously  reaching  out  to  other  art  spaces  and  studios  in  Lövholmen, 
Färgfabriken has created a variety of collaborations with different local initiatives. 
For instance, products from local designers and artworks from local artists are sold 
in Färgfabriken’s shop under the label “created in Lövholmen!” 
 “We try to gather information and make it available for more people, also 
to be a space for creative ideas about the future. We don’ have formal 
power and are not the ones to plan the area but we’re the only ones to be 
still here at the next stage. We are a gathering point.” Karin Englund

Since 2007, Färgfabriken has been directly engaged in the discussion about the 
future of Lövholmen. Following an exhibition about Lövholmen in 2007 that

Grant Agreement No 776766

explored the possibilities of keeping existing buildings and the industrial 
ambiance of the area, Färgfabriken has taken the role of initiating, coordinating 
and hosting a series of exhibitions, events and discussions about the area’s 
transformation. Recently, the foundation has been granted by the culture 
administration of the municipality with funding for collecting knowledge about the 
area, mapping local actors, building networks among them and serve as a 
gathering point for their discussions. Färgfabriken has kept a space in its building 
devoted for this discussion where opinions, ideas, feedbacks are collected. An 
online questionnaire complements this platform in the virtual space. 
“We  became  a  brand:  interesting,  young,  with  unexpected  activities.”

8 Policies and municipal relations 
Since its foundation, Färgfabriken was intended to be a place for free expression, 
avoiding  any  political,  religious  or  any  other  kind  of  affiliation.  With  the 
foundation’s backing, Färgfabriken is more autonomous in setting its own agenda 
than state-owned or funded cultural centres. However, Färgfabriken’s success is 
also  to  be  found  in  the  support  coming  from  the  local  institutional  and  political 
contexts, which was indeed interested and conducive for the use of culture as an 
instrument for urban renovation and rehabilitation of industrial sites.  
At the time of Färgfabriken’s opening, the organisation’s members approached the 
Ministry  of  Culture  for  funding.  Not  being  a  museum or  a  private  gallery, 
Färgfabriken  was  initially  not  eligible  for  funding  but  later,  changes  in  eligibility 
rules  gave  the  organisation  access  to  about  800,000  crowns  (about  80,000  in 
today’s euro) per year. 
The  foundation  also  entertains  a  good  relationship  with  the  municipality  of 
Stockholm and receives regular funding for its activities. However, this relationship 
lacks  more  concrete  projects,  a  clearer  vision  and  more  consistent  funding  for 
longer term collaboration between the municipality and Färgfabriken.  
“Municipalities pay enormous amounts to consultancies. With 
Färgfabriken, instead, they get a lot of value out of being a partner in an 
exhibition, just by confronting new audiences, a mix of different people.” 
Jan Rydén   
Despite the lack of municipal ownership in the area, municipal regulations can have 
a strong impact on the future of Lövholmen. Zoning regulations demand that new 
residential  areas  have  active  ground  floors.  This  gives  an  opportunity  for  more 
diversity in the future development of the area, and the chance to Färgfabriken to 
coordinate efforts to keep artistic production in the neighbourhood.  
9 Economic model 
At  the  early  years  of  Färgfabriken,  its  founders  explored  a variety  of  funding 
sources to help run its activities. The first exhibitions, for instance, were covered 
by Development Aid funds that had a cultural exchange dimension as well as by 
the Swedish Institute, focusing on cultural collaboration. Färgfabriken’s economic

model has been consolidated in the past decade but a big part of the foundation’s 
budget is linked to grants and sponsorship. The building used by Färgfabriken 
is owned by Lindéngruppen. As such, the foundation depends on a lease of the 
space that is usually renewed every three/four years. As of today, Lindéngruppen 
is Färgfabriken’s main sponsor, contributing around 3 million SEK (285,000 euros) 
to the organisation.  
 “There are rich philanthropists who want to do something good and they 
give money but are not involved. Then you have cultural people who receive 
the  get  money  and  spend  it.  It’s  never  a  real  collaboration.  We  want  to 
bridge that gap between the business and the cultural centre.” Joacim Björk  
The rest of the budget is made up of public grants coming from the government 
(amounting  to  one  million  Swedish  crowns,  or  93,000  euros),  from  the  city 
(amounting  to  800,000  Swedish  crowns,  or  75,000  euros)  and  from  the  region 
(amounting  to  450,000  Swedish  crowns,  or  42,000  euros).  Some  activities  are 
financed by EU funds through international collaboration networks.  
Besides this combination of private engagement and public funding, the foundation 
has been engaged in looking for ways to receive more support from third parties. 
As an example, the image of the foundation is with time becoming more and more 
comprehensive  of  a  diversity  of  subjects  that  are  approached  within  exhibitions 
and events.  
“This is the strategy: creating an image that includes many stakeholders, 
corresponding   to   common   subjects,   yet   including   various   positions, 
interests and expertise.” Joachim Granit  
As a matter of fact, the projects exhibited at Färgfabriken are rarely “standard” art 
projects. It is important that the foundation does not only rely on the art world for 
sponsorship, but from other sectors too. This is the main reason why the initial 
focus on arts and architecture was eventually enlarged to include urban planning. 
In this sense, when the foundation decided to add urban planning as one of the 
main subjects tackled, there was a real need to draw attention from a larger variety 
of actors and stakeholders. By opening up their interest to urban planning, a lot 
more funding became available and pertinent, from a variety of European sources 
as well as in partnership with the Swedish Institute. Hence, as projects exhibited 
at Färgfabriken are very diverse, the kinds of stakeholders they build partnerships 
with are too.  
10 Governance 
Färgfabriken’s governance follows the classical organisational structure of a 
foundation. The organisation’s operations are overseen by a board. The board is 
made up of nine people. Jenny Lindén Urnes, daughter of Ulf G. Lindén and 
owner of Lindéngruppen, is the director of the board. In addition to her, two 
architects, one former politician, one famous artist and a banker constitute the 
board, reflecting the need for a multidisciplinary approach and the making of the 
foundation as a complex network of bringing together a diversity of interests, 
occupations and visions. The board meets four times per year and mainly 
controls the financial side of the organisation, rather than the agenda. The latter 
is almost entirely left to the Färgfabriken staff to define.

„We wanted to build a board to be a supporting body backing Färgfabriken. 
It’s a delicate balance. You can overpower if you have demands, you can 
kill it. We wanted to avoid that. Could we do something for art and 
architecture but leave it very open and free for the team to work?” 
Elizabeth Hatz 
 
2008 brought an important change in the organisation. The founder Ulf G. 
Lindén’s daughter daughter Jenny Lindén Urnes became owner of Lindéngruppen 
and chairwoman of the Färgfabriken Foundation. Her background in art helped 
her to understand the challenges in front of Färgfabriken and take leadership in 
addressing them. When it turned out that Färgfabriken’s director Jan Åman 
mismanaged the foundation’s money, generated financial difficulties within the 
organisation and created an atmosphere of distrust among his colleagues, he 
was immediately removed by the board. To stabilise the situation, the 
relationship between Färgfabriken and Lindéngruppen was formalised.  
The building now hosts two organisations, Färgfabriken as the cultural 
organisation overseen by the foundation and Färgfabriken Events that manages 
the restaurant and other commercial events. Färgfabriken’s everyday tasks as 
well as the design and the management of the exhibitions happening at the 
Kunsthalle, are made possible by a team of five employees. Pernilla Lesse and 
Joachim Granit share the role of leaders since 2009. A collaborative leadership is 
very telling of the way in which the team of Färgfabriken has decided to work, 
one that rejects any strongly hierarchical management structure. The two 
leaders are supported by project managers, who ensure the monitoring of 
exhibitions. Karin Englund is the project manager for urban planning exhibitions, 
Elsa Isaksson works as a project coordinator and Emilia Rosenqvist is in charge 
of art exhibitions. New additions to the team are slowly made but this strongly 
depends on the financial resources the foundation disposes of. The 
communication tasks are equally shared among the members of the team. There 
is a strong bond among staff members that is based on an inevitable need for 
collaboration and transparency, especially given the vulnerable and financially 
dependent situation the foundation has to deal with. Such a bond is not only 
reflected in the relationship among staff members but also at the board level.  
A workplace like this is a team, and over the years the team acquires skills, 
abilities and methods that are very strong and creative.  We never hired a 
new director as the knowledge was there in the team.” Elizabeth Hatz  
The Färgfabriken foundation  board provides  Färgfabriken  with  support, 
advice and quality control. It assures that the organisation has the necessary 
resources and independence in making its cultural agenda, a proper separation 
between the ownership of the building and the organisation’s activities. Despite 
the separation, the board is engaged in a dialogue with the Färgfabriken staff, 
supporting its programming and networking, and having an external, critical but 
friendly view over the organisation’s operations.

11 Impact 
Since its creation, Färgfabriken had a strong influence on the surrounding 
area’s transformation. The mere presence of a cultural venue meant a lot for 
the renovation of the surrounding area. At the beginning, when the foundation 
was launched, the area was a really uncomfortable place to work in as a cultural 
initiative. During the first exhibitions, people thought it was absurd that such a 
centre was established in such a far away and disconnected area. However, in 
little time, the city started having interests to ameliorate the urban context 
around with streetlights, public transport and even a school opened. Moreover, 
when some of the neighbouring factories closed, various buildings became 
incubators for small companies and studios for artists. Many activities in the 
foundation are in a way or another related to the surrounding neighbourhood, 
have impacted its recent development and are still playing a crucial role for the 
design of future plans. In the past decade, Färgfabriken has essentially become a 
gathering point to discuss the future of the Lövholmen area, taking a position to 
keep working spaces and cultural venues in the future development besides the 
inevitable residential complexes.  
“I think the whole area of Lövholmen and more recent industrial buildings 
offer such incredible opportunity to have another way of living and thinking. 
Färgfabriken has a role and responsibility to tell the stories of these sites, 
the topography as well as the negotiation between the building, the city, the 
water and the climate that such constructions show.” Elizabeth Hatz  
Besides its impact on its immediate surroundings, the foundation has influenced 
the way urban planning dilemmas are discussed in Stockholm. Färgfabriken 
played an important role by raising awareness of the need for infrastructural 
development through its debates, and the Färgfabriken method brought a lot 
of different actors to debate on the same topic around the same table. Such a 
working dynamic is very interesting since it saw collaborations and conversations 
happening between stakeholders that would have not met otherwise. Moreover, 
it made people aware of a diversity of working logics and environments.  
Färgfabriken staff has been keen on sharing their experiences and contributing to 
the creation of similar venues. The organisation’s model has been reproduced in 
other  contexts  as  well.  Between  2008-2011,  the  organisation  was  engaged  in 
creating  Färgfabriken  Norr  (Färgfabriken  North)  in Östersund,  North  Sweden, 
helped  by  EU  funding,  but  this  experience  was  discontinued  after  Färgfabriken 
withdrew from running the venue and wanted to give over the operations to the 
municipality.  Since  2012,  through  the  New  Urban  Topologies  project,  another 
version of the institution has been operating in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
built up by Färgfabriken and its local sister organisation.

Executive summary 
Largo  Residências is  a  hostel,  hotel,  artist-in-residence  and  café  in  Lisbon's  fast-changing 
Intendente  neighbourhood.  Largo  Residências,  run  by a  cooperative,  uses  its  revenue  from 
tourism and events to develop projects to support the cultural and social inclusion of the most 
vulnerable groups. In the past years, Largo has become a social net for many of the area’s 
residents and a community as well as a community hub, leading the discussion about Lisbon’s 
touristification and gentrification. Endangered by the tourism-driven real estate development 
transforming the city’s historical areas, Largo has been working on opening new spaces for its 
activities.

2 The story of the building  
Largo Residências is located in a 4-floor building built in the late 19
th
 century, at 
Largo Intendente, the central square of the Intendente neighbourhood. Originally 
built as a ceramic factory, in the past decades it had been used as a pension and 
brothel:  it  hosted  an  illegal  sex  workers  business  on  the  first  floor  and  rented 
rooms on the upper floors. Because of its illegal operations, the landlord lost the 
property  in  a  juridical  process.  The  new  owner  began a  renovation  including  an 
additional floor at the top of the building, but passed it over to the initiators of 
Largo  Residências  who  inherited  a  construction  site.  In  2011,  the  building  was 
rented for 10 years by this initiative that renovated it and adapted it to be used 
for commercial and artistic purposes, creating a hostel, a hotel, an art residency 
and a café hosting community gatherings. With Largo Residências approaching the 
end of its 10-year contract, there is increasing pressure on the building’s tenants 
from  the  owners’  side  to  break  up  the  contract  sell  the  building,  probably  to 
become yet another high-end hotel in Central Lisbon.  
“Actually, when we first came here, the sexual workers in the area thought 
I was a new Madame.” Marta Silva  
3 The initiative 
Largo Residências was initiated by a group of people rotating around the cultural 
association  SOU  Cultural  Association  (SOU  Associação  Cultural),  set  up  by  the 
dancer, educator and cultural producer Marta Silva. The association used to have 
a venue a few streets away from today's Largo, in the Mouraria neighbourhood, 
organising performing arts classes and cultural programs. With the economic crisis, 
as  participants  were  less  and  less  able  to  pay  their  courses,  SOU’s  activities 
became insufficient to cover the venue’s expenses and their attempts to secure 
grants were unsuccessful.  
The group decided to open an artistic space that could be financially sustainable 
and  thus  cover  the  costs  of  cultural  work  and  have  a  positive  impact  on  the 
community. The goal of Largo Residências was to contribute to the regeneration 
of a marginalised area in Lisbon. Renting a vacant building facing the Intendente 
square served this purpose: to combine activities of social inclusion and cultural 
effervescence  with  economic  sustainability  in  an  environment  where  public 
buildings were not available and public grants were limited. Looking around in the 
area of Intendente, Marta Silva and her associates found a variety of buildings and 
the  one  on  Largo  Intendente  was  in  a  better  shape  than  many  others  and  this 
made renovation less costly and therefore more feasible. The many rooms of the 
building  whose  walls  were  unmoveable gave  the  idea  of  an  artist  residency, 
focusing on a specific segment of potential visitors as tourism was practically non-
existent in the area.  
"I tried to convince my colleagues to do something bigger for the 
neighbourhood, to start an association and connect art to this area. Ten 
years ago, we were the only cultural association here. Now this 
neighbourhood is known as one of the most cultural neighbourhoods in the 
city." Marta Silva

Marta Silva’s first collaborators in Largo Residências were members of SOU. Each 
team  member  was  a  newcomer  in  the  tourism,  commerce  and  property 
management sectors: they all took over professional tasks that were new for them 
and they had to rely on their learning skills and external advice to perform well. 
Consultations with lawyers and economists helped to develop a legal and economic 
structure with a social business angle and called for the participation of cooperative 
members. Architects of the studio Ateliermob, for instance, who originally joined 
the process to design the renovation, have got involved in the core issues of the 
project  and  soon become  members  of  the  cooperative.  Twelve  members  joined 
Largo’s  cooperative  and  they  contributed  with  ideas,  financial  investments  and 
expertise.  
“I had no management experience and my heart was much bigger than my 
brain. Now we have a good balance between brain and heart: cooperative 
members were fundamental in the design of the management model and in 
filtering ideas.” Marta Silva 
Developing a working model for Largo Residências was a gradual process that was 
built  with  the  inputs  from  friends,  family  members  and  from  the  various 
cooperative members. In time, the group developed the concept of a studio/artist 
residency space mixed with a tourist accommodation facility, so that artistic work 
would be sustained by the revenue from the commercial unit.  
Largo launched its cultural and social programming while renovating the building. 
It  also  opened  the  hostel,  one  room  after  the  other,  to  balance  the  renovation 
expenses with the hostel's revenue. The first two years were financially difficult as 
the hostel was operating only partially and it remained closed in winter due to big 
heat loss in some rooms. The café studio opened in 2013, and it was an immediate 
success. Within 3 years Largo was ready and fully working.   
“We  want  to  build  this  area  and  not  abandon  it.  This  project  only  makes 
sense if it's locally based and if you manage to build the area.” Tiago Mota 
Saraiva 
The rental contract of the building hosting Largo Residências expires in 2021 and 
the building is expected to be sold for commercial purposes. Largo is searching for 
an alternative venue where to carry on its activities. In the future location, Largo 
members  plan  to  implement  a  similar  project  but  also  work  on  developing  a 
cooperative  housing  project  that  would  help  overcome  the  housing  gap  in  the 
neighbourhood.  
4 Activities 
Today  Largo  Residências  is  located  in  a  4-floor  building.  It  is  a multipurpose 
space that combines social, cultural and commercial functions. The apartments of 
the artist residency are situated at the top floor. Artists stay in Largo for a period 
of 2 to 6 months according to their projects. Besides artists, these apartments also 
host architects, cultural producers and others involved in Largo’s programmes and 
operations  including  receptionists.  Largo  Residências  gives  artists  supporting 
conditions  for  their work in  various  arts  sectors  such as  plastic and  visual  arts, 
dance,  theatre,  literature,  photography,  video,  performance,  gastronomy  and 
fashion; and it also hosts academic and research projects, as well as professionals 
from different fields such as anthropology, sociology, psychology, and architecture.

It requires residents' projects to be a contribution to the local community and its 
territory. Besides the residents’ spaces, the top floor also hosts Largo’s production 
office.

The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 floors, about 200 m2 each are dedicated to the short-term rental 
and  they  usually  host  tourists  but also students,  journalists and artists.  The  1
st
 
floor  has  8  private  rooms  with  connected private  bathrooms,  while  the  2
nd
 floor 
hosts  a  hostel  with  9  rooms,  with  shared  bathrooms,  kitchen  and  living  rooms. 
Largo has established collaborations with other cultural and social institutions such 
as universities, theatres and festivals, who prefer Largo to a regular hotel. The 2
nd
 
floor also hosts the reception.  
“Visiting the building and knowing that hairdressers and cafés are the most 
important meeting points, we thought we should have a café as it would be 
the meeting point for not only our workers but also our neighbours and local 
people.  We  thought,  let’s  see  if  this  place  can  also  serve  as  an  artistic 
platform or a studio, a small theatre.” Marta Silva  
On the ground floor, Largo has a cafeteria, a studio and a shop occupying around 
150  m2.  The  café  contributes  to  the  sustainability  of  the  entire  socio-cultural 
project, it creates a meeting point for the community and it is where most of the 
cultural programming takes place. The studio is one of the workspaces for artists 
in  residence  and  a  venue  for  some  presentations  of  their  creations.  Besides 
presenting the work of Largo's artists, it also has a regular free-of-charge cultural 
programme with concerts, exhibitions, book presentations. The studio stays open

to the public to be used for informal gatherings also when their activities are not 
organized. Besides its own venues, Largo's ground floor also hosts the Bike Pop 
Shop, a multidisciplinary space dedicated to the promotion of bicycle culture run 
by a cooperative and the Largo Loja vinyl record store, a social business:  they 
rent   ground   floor   spaces   from   Largo,   thus   contributing   to   the   financial 
sustainability of the building’s management.

5 Renovation and adaptive reuse 
Located at the recently renovated Largo Intendente, Largo Residências is part of 
the historical tissue of Intendente. The building has a typical façade with ceramic 
tiles that refer to its original function as a ceramic factory and makes it one of the 
most spectacular landmarks on the square. The building enjoys heritage protection 
because it is located in the protection zone around two classified buildings, 
the Fábrica de Cerâmica da Viúva Lamego (Viúva Lamego’s ceramic factory) and 
the building located at the corner of Largo do Intendente and Avenida do Almirante 
Reis. Situated in this buffer zone, the building of Largo Residências, together with 
all other buildings in the block, are protected by local and national law. This implies 
that any change in the facades of these buildings needs approval by the Ministry 
of Culture. In practice, this protection makes any alteration complicated and time-
consuming.

Before  renting  the  building  to  Largo  Residências,  the  new  landlord  started  the 
building’s renovation from the 3rd floor down. Largo took over the renovation of 
the rest of the building: each floor used to be organised into two apartments, and 
they  had  to  be  divided  into  rooms,  while  the  ground  floor  was  converted  into  a 
café and a studio.  
"We did the basic design of the project but we had to reinvent it many 
times as we found huge structural problems in the building that we did not 
expect.” Tiago Mota Saraiva 
At  the  moment  of  signing  the  rental  contract,  the  structural  conditions  of  the 
building were not entirely clear for the Largo team. Incongruities are common in 
Lisbon  buildings  constructed  at  the  end  of  the  19
th
 century  because  of  the 
liberalisation of construction procedures in the 20
th
 century that allowed modifying 
structural  and  non-structural  walls  without  following  a  plan.  In  many  buildings 
modified in the past decades, problems are not seen immediately and they appear 
only after starting a renovation. In the case of Largo, there were many technical 
issues to solve, including an electricity system non-compliant with current legal 
standards and the absence of structural walls. 
“We  could  not  do  the  conventional  process  of  making  a  detailed  project 
design  and  giving  it  over  to  the  contractor.  It  did  not  work  like  that.  We 
spent a lot of time on the site and in the construction process and re-adapted 
the design when it was needed.” Tiago Mota Saraiva   
The renovation of the building and its opening coincided with the rehabilitation of 
the square facing the building, Largo Intendente. The square’s renovation created 
a lot of difficulties for the first period of operating Largo: the whole area was a 
construction site and this negatively affected both pedestrian traffic and tourism,

while Largo needed revenue to reinvest into the renovation and into the launch of 
its activities.  
“The first two years were hard in a touristic sense because Intendente was 
like a construction site with a lot of dust.” Marta Silva 
Largo Residências has been working on embracing both the tangible and intangible 
heritage of the building and the neighbourhood. Highlighting the building’s past as 
a ceramic factory, Largo develops a variety of activities related to the ceramic tiles 
once  produced  in  the  building  and  used  across  the  neighbourhood  and  the  city. 
Going beyond the building, Largo has been active in mapping the neighbourhood’s 
social  memory,  countering  the  process  of  forgetting  as  a  consequence  of 
gentrification and touristification.

6 The area and its transition  
“Intendente  and  Mouraria  were  always  very  resistant  places  in  the  city, 
zones of obscurity that stayed for centuries, and decades till now. They were 
always hard to gentrify.” Ana Jara 
Largo  Residências  is  situated  on  Largo  Intendente,  the  central  square  of 
Intendente.  Intendente  is  a  historical  neighbourhood  in  Lisbon,  about  1,5 
kilometres Northeast from the city’s central square Praça do Comércio. Despite its 
central location within the historical tissue of Lisbon, in the last decades of the 20
th
 
century the area has been largely neglected by city councils and developers. In 
line with this lack of investment, together with the neighbouring area Mouraria, 
Intendente has become one of the most accessible, cosmopolitan and multicultural 
areas of the city. In the 1970s, with the demolition of some of the most conflictful 
neighbourhoods of Lisbon, many families from these areas moved to Intendente, 
bringing with them drug and sex businesses. As a result, Intendente has become 
a secluded area with a bad reputation across the city.  
"For 30-40  years,  this  area  was  one of  the  darkest  places  of  the  city. The 
square was psychologically much bigger than the actual space, because of 
the traffic, the illegal drug trade and prostitution.” Marta Silva 
Around 2010, the city council decided to start a process for the revitalization of 
Mouraria and Intendente, the two neighbourhoods connected by Largo Intendente. 
The  mayor  of  the  time,  Antonio  Costa,  moved  his  office  to  Largo  Intendente 
because he believed that working from the inside, for three years, would be an 
efficient  strategy  for  improving  the  neighbourhood.  A  key  part  of  the  big  urban 
regeneration plan for the area was the physical renovation of Largo Intendente, 
which  created  a  clearer,  more  accessible,  more  transparent  urban  square.  The 
mayor’s  move  to  Intendente  and  the  regeneration  plan  has  received  a  lot  of 
attention and involved a variety of local actors, including Largo Residências. The 
mayor  invited  Largo  to  co-organise  the  2011  and  2012  editions  of  the Festival 
Todos (Portuguese  for  “Everyone”)  which  brought  many  Lisboans  to  Intendente 
and gave visibility to the area and Largo Residências. 
"Largo Intendente is a symbolical centre of radical change in Lisbon. This 
area of the city used to have a flourishing market of drugs and prostitution, 
it  was  considered  a  dark  area  and  many  Lisboans  would  not  come here. 
Things began changing when key community agents started working in this 
area to create new living conditions, to increase the quality of life, and to 
attract people here." Roberto Falanga 
Following the renovation, the Intendente area has been radically transformed. In 
the past years, it has developed into a conflict zone between citizen-led initiatives 
trying  to  improve  living  conditions  for  the  residents  of  this  area,  and  investors 
buying  up  buildings  and  converting  them  into  hotels  and  short-term  rental 
apartment complexes. This evolution coincides with tourism assuming a greater 
role in Lisbon’s city economy with many sectors specializing in tourism as well as 
the  long-term  housing  market  shifting  towards  a  short-term  apartment  rental 
system, undermining housing provision in the central areas of the city.

”All programs carried in Lisbon in the 2011-2013 period have reinforced the 
interest of foreign investors in Lisbon. Lisbon was the perfect city to invest: 
beautiful, sunny, cheap, and with many empty buildings in the city centre. I 
don't think Largo Residências accelerated the change, but they were in the 
heart of the change." Roberto Falanga 
Intendente’s recent transformation is the result of a combination of local and global 
processes.  One  important  aspect  is  the  recent liberalisation  of  the  housing 
market in the 2000s. As a residue of the Fascist regime in Portugal, rental prices 
had been frozen since the 1940s and it had strongly affected Portuguese cities with 
significant rental markets. The long-term consequence of fixed rent prices was a 
lack of funds for landlords to maintain their properties and it led to the structural 
deterioration  of  buildings  in  entire  neighbourhoods.    While  poor  tenants  were 
protected  by  the  law,  landlords  did  not  invest  in  their  properties  and  many 
buildings were left abandoned in Central Lisbon areas like Intendente. Since 2004, 
new  policies  of  the  government  and  municipalities  have  opened  the  housing 
market to private investors. With the economic crisis of 2008-2009, under pressure 
by the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank, Portugal 
privatised many public buildings; changed its rent laws and lifted the rent freeze, 
leading to massive transformation in Portuguese real estate. As landlords no longer 
had to respect a rent price limit, evictions occurred in massive numbers, altering 
the demographics of the city and creating a housing gap.  
“We never had massive evictions in our urban history and now we are seeing 
the consequences of it.” Luis Mendes

Another  component  of  Intendente’s  transformation is  the quick touristification 
of Central Lisbon. Troubled by the economic crisis, Portugal has not only embraced 
the liberalisation of its housing stock but also the creation of fiscal programs that 
attract foreign investment – including the so-called Golden Visas. The liberalisation 
of  Lisbon’s  housing  stock  went  in  pairs  with  growing  interest  in  investing  into 
properties  in  the  city.  Real  estate  investment,  produced  by  international  funds, 
was  injected  in  the  housing  sector  to  promote  luxury  apartments  and  private 
condominiums. An increasing part of this investment went into tourism facilities: 
fearing the spread of global terrorism, many people and investors withdrew their 
investments from tourism resorts in North Africa and moved them into Portugal, a 
safe country with low prices and high life standards.  
"The real estate market has been emptied of its social function as housing, 
to become financial asset for international investors." Luis Mendes 
Besides public investment in public spaces like in the case of Largo Intendente and 
social housing in peripheral areas of the city, there has been little public investment 
into the refurbishment of the existing building stock. Cuts in government funding 
forced  the  municipality  to  sell  many  buildings,  also  in  Intendente.  With  the 
privatisation of a part of the remaining public building stock, including buildings on 
Largo Intendente, even public investment in public spaces ultimately contributes 
to  the  increase  of  the  value  of  private  property,  thus  aggravating  the  housing 
situation   in   central   neighbourhoods   and   leading   to   gentrification   and 
touristification.  
“From 2016, big investment started to come. All the new shops, all buildings 
were up for sale and they were quickly sold. And sold again. And sold again. 
Big  speculation  came  and  suddenly  this  area  turned  into  a  completely 
different atmosphere.” Marta Silva  
 
“In some parts of the city we cannot speak of social bonds anymore because 
many inhabitants have moved out. The social capital and memory that was 
essential to the resilience of these places is lost. That is a big issue that has 
to   be   understood   to   prevent   the   worst   gentrification   and   urban 
transformation yet to come.” Luis Mendes 
Lisbon’s newly found economic dynamism has created new conflicts, by displacing 
people from central areas and destroying traditional social and economic tissues. 
With long delays in regulating short-term rental, homes were turned into Airbnb 
facilities  and  traditional  economic  activities  were  replaced  by  tourism-oriented 
businesses, radically transforming the neighbourhood and its perception. Members 
of  Largo  Residências  were  afraid  of  becoming  just  an  additional  player  in  the 
gentrification  process,  therefore  they  prioritised  the  involvement  of  the  local 
community  in  neighbourhood  activities  and  worked  to  maintain  and  strengthen 
structures of solidarity, networks of the local commerce and looked for solutions 
to the housing crisis.  
“I  think  this  very  central  location helped capital  investors  consider Largo 
Intendente as an attractive place to invest. Nevertheless, local associations 
Touristification is the process of adapting the urban realm to tourist needs. It 
often implies the redistribution of resources from local to touristic uses and it 
often triggers a gap in rental and a real estate speculation and increases in 
prices for residents.

engaged  in  neighbourhood  initiatives  represent  the  resistance  to  the 
cannibalisation of the city.” Roberto Falanga

7 Community involvement  
Until  a  decade  ago,  Intendente  was  perceived  as  a  dangerous  and  conflicted 
neighbourhood   and   most   Lisbon   residents   would   avoid   the   area.   The 
communication work of Largo Residências, therefore, focussed on changing the 
bad reputation of the neighbourhood as well as of the building itself. Largo has 
reached  out  to  specific  groups:  the  residents  of  Intendente,  artists  cultural 
producers and art institutions active in the area as well as local shopkeepers.  
“In  2012,  reconstruction  works  at  the  square  were  finished  and  Antonio 
Costa  came  to  us  and  asked  us  to  make  an  inauguration  party.  I  said,  all 
right, we can make a festival. You can think about the big names to fill the 
square  but  I  will  propose  small  things,  community  projects  to  engage 
people, to have the opening with neighbours being part of it.” Marta Silva  
The  first  step  in  opening  the  building  was  to  meet  representatives  of  the  local 
community and to build connections with the groups of artists organised around 
SOU. In the first year, Largo developed its social business plan but it also invested 
time  in  building  long-lasting  relationships with  those  living  in  Intendente,  which 
eventually  led  to  the  development  of  participatory  cultural  projects  involving  a 
wide range of people from the area. In the first two years, from 2011 to 2013, 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Largo Rêsidencias Lisbon Observatory Case 
16 
 
much  effort  was  also  invested  into  building  a  relationship  also  with  local 
institutions.  Slowly  but  steady,  Largo  Residências  has  gained  the  features  of  a 
community  centre  around  which  people  from  the  neighbourhood  have  started 
gathering.  
"My mission is to connect with the people on the streets, to be part of the 
social  processes and  cultural  programs,  and  to  become  the  mediator 
between the citizens and the politicians. Now, I speak to the mayor and the 
prime  minister  in  the  same  way  that  I  talk  with  the  drug  dealers."  Marta 
Silva 
When moving in the building on Largo Intendente, Largo Residências only had a 
few neighbours: old bars, sports pubs and an 82-year-old saloon. The square was 
being  under  construction  and  this  kept  away  visitors,  and  new  commercial  and 
socio-cultural uses came to the square only after the constructions finished. The 
most direct engagement of Largo took place at the street level: the cooperative 
members  spent  much  time  talking  to  people  on  the  streets,  in  the  squares, 
frequenting  the  neighbourhood’s  bars  to  get  to  know  the  area's  residents,  gain 
their trust and invite them to visit and spend time at Largo Residências. This work 
included  collecting  local  stories  countering  the  mainstream  narratives  of  the 
neighbourhood, presenting the image of a neighbourhood with strong community 
ties and solidarity networks.  
“People living in Intendente needed mediation to help restore social bonds 
and mobilisation to fight for housing and other urban rights.” Luis Mendes 
Largo Residências represents a model of skills and knowledge production. The 
most  important  skills  developed  by  the  Largo  team  in  their  social  business  are 
mediation and non-verbal communication. Largo’s work is based on relationships 
of  trust  and  collaboration  and  it  requires  the  ability  to  create  relationships  and 
balance one's involvement in partnerships. 
"In partnerships, you give your hand and they take the full body. Now, I am 
more  protective  when  it  comes  to  creating  new  partnerships  with  other 
institutions.” Marta Silva 
The Largo team was aware of the risks of supporting gentrification with their work 
and they tried to contrast this possibility by favouring local engagement in their 
activities. A bottom-up approach to urban rehabilitation was sought by mediating 
between  public  institutions  and  the  local  community  and  by  developing  new 
functions according to the community needs. Largo was also a key actor in building 
local networks of associations as well as shopkeepers to be able to resist pressure 
from  real  estate  developers.  In  time,  Largo  gained  visibility  in  the  city  and  it 
strengthened its ability to speak up on the neighbourhood issues and to suggest 
possible  improvements  on  behalf  of  the  community.  It  also  works  as  informal 
mediator among various entities which are connected to Largo Intendente.  
“We were keen on not acting as gentrifiers but to strengthen the networks 
of local commerce, local shops and help the residents who suffered the 
most from the crisis and austerity first, and from tourism and real estate 
speculation afterwards. In a certain way we were trying to reorganise 
community in the neighbourhood” Tiago Mota Saraiva

Besides the regular activities inside the Largo Residências venue, Largo is at the 
centre of a wide range of initiatives that attempt to connect and strengthen the 
local  community  in  Largo  Intendente.  Largo  Residências  organizes  theatre 
projects,  dance  workshops,  exhibitions  featuring  the  artists  in  residence,  and 
festivals in Largo Intendente. Moreover, members of Largo‘s cooperative often act 
as representatives of the community’s needs on the city level, and they are vocal 
advocates for community rights especially in regards to housing.  
“The  projects  developed  in  Largo  Residências  use  art  to  empower  people 
and  to  bring  a  reflexive  way  of  thinking  about what  is  happening  in  their 
personal lives as well as in the urban surrounding.” Helène Veiga Gomes 
Anthropologists and urbanists have contributed to Largo’s better knowledge of 
the area. The visual anthropologist, Helène Veiga Gomes conducted a 
participatory ethnography research in the area during the reconstruction of Largo 
Intendente. She asked residents to document their daily trajectories and 
collected valuable data about the intangible heritage of the neighbourhood. The 
project results were exhibited in an abandoned building, which has later been 
renovated and transformed into a restaurant. 
Cultural events and programmes produced in Largo often focus on the life and 
personal stories of local residents. For example, the theatre project called 
Companie Limitade built a theatre piece starting from the story of the people 
living in the neighbourhood who were suffering from solitude or dealing with 
diseases. The final piece included visits to residents’ homes to experience their 
living conditions.

"Largo’s projects aim to develop good practices in the neighbourhood. A lot 
of them are linked to interculturality and they encourage the better inclusion 
of  people  living  in  the  neighbourhood  through  language  and  cultural 
mediation." Helène Veiga Gomes 
Another project, Escuta aims to describe urban transformation through the 
experience of Largo Residências and other initiatives in the area. Escuta explores 
the work of many associations and institutions working in Intendente and 
Mouraria. In the first phase, a pop-up container was installed in Largo Intendente 
for one month and it hosted the Escuta radio, interviewing a variety of local 
actors. The container attracted people in the area because of its position and 
transparent architectural features and had transmitted a live stream radio show. 
This container became a meeting point as all kinds of people were stopping to 
listen. One segment of Escuta covers personal narratives through photographs 
and texts, and another one is an audio-visual project that will result in a film. 
Those media are used as cumulative processes, mining data about the 
neighbourhood and collecting people's voices to build a tool for reflection about 
the transformation of Central Lisbon.  
“Largo works with the social tissue of the neighbourhood, boosting its social 
innovation,   its   urban   participation,   reinforcing   the   strength   of   the 
neighbourhood’s citizens.” Luis Mendes  
To   support   its   business   model,   Largo   Residências   also   had   the   develop 
communication  with  the  outside  world.  In  order  to  reach  a  wider  number  of 
tourists, Largo joined accommodation platforms like Booking.com and Hostelworld, 
and  it  became  well-known  in  networks  of  festivals  and  art  institutions.  Despite 
difficulties to communicate the social aspect of its operations, Largo makes a great 
effort to explain its mission to first-time visitors and engage them for their further 
visits.  
"At that time, we were just at the beginning of Lisbon’s touristification 
process. We were one of the first hostels that appeared, in a moment that 
tourism was beginning to increase. Now Largo is fighting with other 
accommodation providers that are pushing residents out of Lisbon’s 
centre." Marta Silva 
8 Municipal policies and programmes 
Intendente  and  Largo  Residências  have  been  in  the  focus  of  various  municipal 
policies. The shift of municipal policies from running social and cultural projects to 
supporting initiatives to run these projects coincided with Largo’s ambition to run 
a  space  that  can  secure  its  economic  sustainability.  The  renovation  of  Largo 
Intendente, initiated by the mayor’s office in 2011, has rejuvenated the face of the 
neighbourhood,  with  upgraded  public  spaces  but  also  potentially  contributing  to 
gentrification  and  touristification.  When  the  mayor  moved  his  office  to  Largo 
Intendente,  this  proximity  favoured  various  types  of  collaboration  with  Largo 
Residências  some  of  which  like  festivals  and  advocacy  initiatives  continue  until 
today.  The  mayor’s  office  was  also  instrumental  in  connecting  the  initiators  of 
Largo with the landowner of their building.

“I always had an impression that this square is amazing, in the city centre, 
but empty. It looked like a public living room already before it was rebuilt 
and re-developed.” Marta Silva 
In the same period as the beginning of renovations in the area, Intendente and 
Mouraria  were  identified  by  the  city  council  as  priority  neighbourhoods  where 
specific funding needs to be targeted. The BIP/ZIP program, launched in 2010, 
was  created  to  facilitate  targeted  seed  funding  to  organisations  and  initiatives 
operating in these priority areas.  
“The very central idea of the program is to provide local associations and 
informal  groups  of  citizens  the  opportunity  to  build  partnerships  and  to 
propose ideas for the regeneration of the city.” Roberto Falanga 
 
The  funded  initiatives are  monitored  and  evaluated by  the  administrative  team: 
initiatives are required to deliver to the municipality self-monitoring reports and 
the team of the municipality monitors the implementation of the initiative on the 
field. The program is also evaluated by a team  which measures  the quantitative 
and  qualitative  results  of  BIP/ZIP.  The  evaluation  takes  into  consideration 
quantitative data (the number of partnerships created, the numbers of activities 
developed within such partnerships, and the budget allocated) and qualitative data 
(surveys  with  the  initiatives  and  with  the  citizens  who  benefitted  from  the 
programs).  
”The BIP/ZIP programme created a fabric of associations and local practices 
that were very interesting; the question is why it did not grow in the last 
eight  years.  Now  urban  policies  are  very  focused  on  another  kind  of 
interventions,   supporting   creative   hubs,   creating   businesses   and   an 
economy that comes from big investments.” Ana Jara 
Largo Residências has been an active participant in various seasons of the BIP/ZIP 
programme. A winner of a 50,000 grant in 2011 that contributed to launching the 
building and its operations, Largo and its partners Ateliermob and Working with 
the 99% later on successfully applied again with their plan of establishing an anti-
eviction information office in Central Lisbon.  
The BIP/ZIP program was launched by the Lisbon Municipality's Department 
of Housing and Local Development in 2010 to promote strategic partnerships in 
the city's priority neighbourhoods. BIP/ZIP created three indexes which 
mapped social inequalities, infrastructures issues, litter and environmental 
irregularities in Lisbon. BIP/ZIP called for a citizen's consultations to improve 
the so-called "BIP/ZIP chart", and it eventually pinpointed 67 priority areas 
that were considered social territorial fractures, and were spread 
inhomogeneous in the city centre and in the city periphery. The priority areas 
include social housing areas, informal settlements as well as historical 
neighbourhoods. All the selected areas present comparable aspects in terms of 
the high unemployment rate, insecurity, urban hygiene, lack of services, poor 
accessibility. The BIP/ZIP program offers seed funding of up to 50.000 euros to 
initiatives, selected through an open call. An external committee of experts 
appointed by the municipality evaluates the proposals and distributes the 
budget to the single initiatives. These allowances allow local organisations to 
carry out small projects that can act as catalysers of change. The total amount 
of the budget provided a year is about 1,5-2 million euros.

“We think it is good to talk to the municipality and see if they still recognise 
the  work  we do  and  if  they  want  to  take  part  in  the  triangle  between  the 
private sector that owns the building, the municipality and us.” Tiago Mota 
Saraiva 
In  order  to  facilitate  the  best  use  of  this  funding locally,  in  some  of  the  priority 
areas, the municipality has set up Local Coordination Offices, or GABIPs. GABIPs 
function  as  elements  of  a  co-governance  framework  involving  the  municipality, 
local boroughs and all relevant stakeholders and community organisations. They 
promote an articulated response among the political, administrative and technical 
dimensions  with  local  organisations  and  community.  Largo  Residências  had  an 
important place in the local GABIP process and developed a relationship of trust 
both  with  local  communities  and  municipal  offices.  Aware  of  their  work  in  the 
neighbourhood,   municipal   offices   were   increasingly   reaching   out   to   Largo 
Residências to evaluate urban development, and Largo took the role of mediating 
between citizens and the offices of the local authorities.  
“From  that  moment  on  we  didn’t  have  to  knock  on  the  door  of  the 
municipality;  on  the  contrary,  they  were  asking  our  opinion  and  our 
participation in processes. The relationship has changed.” Marta Silva  
 
"These  kinds  of  participatory  processes  need  to  rely  on  a  more  robust 
commitment of public authorities in providing real welfare policies. Without 
providing  citizens  with  concrete  answers  on  primary  needs  like  housing, 
education  and  health,  if  we  do  not  guarantee  and  ensure  that  all  citizens 
have equal access to these goods and services, participatory processes can 
fail to realise a big part of their potential." Roberto Falanga   
The BIP/ZIP program is an important help to start bottom-up urban innovation and 
social initiatives as it gives funding to local associations and groups to develop new 
ideas.  Yet,  this  program  does  not rely  on  broader  policies  that  support  social 
innovation and it might be an insufficient tool to strengthen local communities in 
Lisbon’s   rapid,   market-driven   transformation.   Many   voices   claim   that   the 
competition model of municipal programmes is not able to keep up with the fast 
pace of change in the city.  
“What we feel from the last three years is that we want to change scale. We 
want  to  be  more  than  just  doing  some  works  on  the  public  space  and 
producing some precarious event. When you have a city that is led by private 
investment  that  are  totally  out  of  control,  funded  on  the  Cayman  Islands 
then you have to react fast and cannot wait for competitions.” Tiago Mota 
Saraiva  
GABIPs are present in BIP/ZIP neighbourhoods with their local offices, and 
consist of a coordinator from the municipality and an executive committee with 
local key stakeholders of the urban regeneration process, local authorities, 
local associations and other actors. The precise composition of this committee 
depends on the technical, urban, social, environmental, cultural as well as 
educational aspects of the related projects: usually elected officials and 
representatives of the Department of Housing and Local Development are 
involved, but elected officials from other departments can also take part. The 
GABIPs allow the municipality to move decision-making to the local scale and 
share it with local actors.

Beyond hundreds of interventions at the neighbourhood level, an offspring of the 
BIP/ZIP  programme  is  Lisbon's  Collaborative  Platform  for  Community-Led  Local 
Development (CLLD), an EU-funded governance scheme including over 150 NGOs, 
private enterprises and the local government that aims to develop a global strategy 
to BIP/ZIP. 
 
9 Financial model 
From the moment of visiting buildings on Largo Intendente, the idea of offering 
accommodation to guests was an integral part of Largo’s business model. In the 
first  phase  of  conceiving  Largo  Residências,  however,  its  initiators  did  not  have 
tourism in mind: they were focusing on cultural institutions and events as potential 
clients, who can bring in Largo their performers or artists. Within a few years, this 
focus  was  extended  as  more  and  more  responsible  (if  not  mainstream)  tourists 
began to visit Intendente and other formerly avoidable areas of Central Lisbon. 
Nevertheless, Largo also maintained its residency profile: there are more than 20 
cultural institutions that regularly book rooms in the hotel.  
In order to renovate the building and set up the organisation and pay the rent for 
the  first  months,  Largo  needed  significant  upfront  investment,  about  200.000 
euros: 150,000 euros were needed to create the cafeteria and the other ground 
floor spaces, and another 50,000 euros were spent on renovating the first floor. 
The  upper  floors  were  already  mostly  renovated  so  there  was  no  significant 
investment to be made there.  
"We couldn't go to the bank as we were a new cooperative with no history. 
We  had  to  put  money  from  the  cooperative  members  to  invest  in  the 
renovation works. It took us five to six years to pay back these investments. 
By 2017 we paid back everything and are now saving money." Marta Silva 
 The cooperative of Largo Residências raised money from various sources: 50,000 
euros were invested by the cooperative members (to be paid back six years later 
with 4% interest) and 50,000 euros came from a municipal funding. The remaining 
100,000  euros  were  already  produced  by  Largo’s  economic  activities.  As  an 
important  help  to  the  organisation’s  cash  flow,  the  construction  contractor 
accepted  to  defer  his payment  of  50,000  euros  until after  the  hostel's opening. 
This arrangement functioned as an informal loan and allowed Largo to finish the 
renovation quickly. In addition, architects of Ateliermob offered their services for 
free, in exchange for rooms to host the office’s interns.  
The  renovation  was  organised  step-by-step,  so  that  when  a  floor  was  ready,  it 
opened  and  began  to  generate  revenue,  and  this  allowed  the  renovation  to 
continue on the other floors. Service barter was also an important resource that 
CLLD (Community-Led Local Development) is an instrument created by 
the European Union’s Cohesion Policy 2014-2020, which grants CLLD networks 
access to part of the Structural Funds. CLLDs foresee the management of the 
funding to be shared between the public administration, private and civic 
partners, with none of them having the majority of shares and votes. In the 
case of Lisbon, the CLLD includes over 150 NGOs, private enterprises and local 
government organisations, and its fund disposes of about 1,5 million euros.

was used by Largo Residências in its beginning and which allowed its renovation 
and opening. For example, Largo Residências hosted people in exchange for their 
construction  services  and  it  managed.  Finally,  a  50,000  euros  grant  from  the 
BIP/ZIP  programme  helped  launch  Largo’s  activities  but  could  not  be  spent  of 
infrastructure or renovation.  
By  2017-2018,  Largo’s  revenues  allowed  the  organisation  to  repay  the  original 
cooperative  members’  investment  with  interest  and  to  break  even.  Largo 
Residências  business  plan  is  based  on  using  commercial  revenues  (hotel  and 
hostel) to support the cultural and artistic projects, to cover the workers' wages 
and improve their working conditions. While the hotel and hostel are responsible 
for  most  of  Largo’s  profit,  the  cafeteria,  despite  its  initial  ambitions,  does  not 
generate  revenue  for  cultural  activities.  Functioning  more  as  a  social  café,  it 
accommodates  people  who  spend  long  periods  of  time  without  consuming. 
Nevertheless,  due  to  its  community  function  and  the  six  jobs  it  maintains,  the 
cafeteria remains an integral part of Largo Residências.  
“Our workers at the café are also social assistants for the neighbours that 
come  with  their  problems,  they  speak,  they  are  friends  so  it’s  difficult  to 
keep a code and technical way of working there. The café pays the bills but 
it doesn’t give a big profit – but we decided to keep it because it’s an open 
door to the community.” Marta Silva  
Largo’s main expense is the commercial rent paid to the building’s owner. While 
the rent was originally defined 8000 euros a month, it has been lowered to 6000 
euros  after  a  long  negotiation,  due  to  the  significant  structural  problems 
encountered  in  the  building  and  the  renovations  needed  to  be  undertaken.  The 
relationship with the building’s owner has been worsening in the past years. 
Preparing to put the building for sale, the owner has repeatedly threatened the 
cooperative with eviction in case of delays with the rent payment, despite various 
verbal  and  formal  agreements.  With  a  rental  contract  expiring  in  2021,  Largo 
Residências  is  in  the  process  of  finding  a  new  space  in  the  neighbourhood, 
preferably a building in public ownership.  
Aware  of  Largo’s  achievements  and  positive  impact  in  the  neighbourhood,  at  a 
certain point of the conflict, the municipality came in as a third party to negotiate 
between Largo and the property owner and to ease the situation. Disposing of a 
pre-emption  right,  the  municipality  has  considered  buying  the  building,  but  the 
property owner has changed strategy and is now selling the company that owns 
the  building,  in  order  to  come  around  the  municipality’s  pre-emption  right  and 
reduce taxes.  
10 Governance 
“When I asked for legal advice, people told me that we couldn’t keep 
the project in the form of an association because the commercial part 
would  be  bigger  than  the  cultural  part  to  finance.  Therefore,  we 
needed  to  create  a  cooperative,  so  that  we  could  run  the  social 
business and we could still support the non-profit activities.” Marta 
Silva

Largo Residências has the organisational form of a cooperative. The cooperative 
model was chosen because it was considered suitable to represent an entity that 
combines commercial activities with cultural and social activity. It also allowed to 
include the organisation’s workers in Largo’s ownership and decision-making, with 
equal votes.  
“We  started  as  a  cooperative  because  this  allowed  us  to  integrate 
funds  from  the  members  and  invest  them  in  the  renovation  of  our 
building.” Tiago Mota Saraiva  
The cooperative was founded by 3 members, and it was joined by 10 members. 
Two of the three founding members are still involved in the project. The founding 
members  were  all  from  the  same  area:  neighbours, friends,  co-workers  and 
parents  of  children  in  the  same  schools.  They  had  different  backgrounds  and 
professions but shared the desire of developing a social program in the Intendente 
neighbourhood.   Members   of   the   cooperative   invested   in   the   organisation 
financially, with their work and skills. Financial investments were not equal among 
members but each member maintains equal decision-making power. 
"Since  the  beginning,  we  wanted  to  create  a  group  composed  of 
people experiencing different conditions of life. One of our members 
put 15 euros in the cooperative, someone else gave 20,000 euros and 
they had the same vote." Marta Silva 
The cooperative has three sectors, one taking care of cultural activities, another is 
responsible  for  accommodation  and  the  third  one  for  the  cafeteria,  each  sector 
with a coordinator. Some people move between different sectors as their ambitions 
change. Not all members of the cooperative work daily at Largo Residências. Some 
of  them  do  not join  discussions  about  the  daily  operations  but  longer-term 
strategies  and  the  mission  of  the  cooperative,  the  quality  of  partnerships  and 
networks.  
 
11 Impact 
Largo  Residências  has  created  a  variety  of services in  the  neighbourhood  that 
benefit  local  residents.  By  channelling  the  revenues  of  its  commercial  activities 
(tourist  accommodation  and  cafeteria)  into  local activities  and  events that 
enable artists to share their work and local residents to build networks and join 
forces around the most pressing issues that are transforming the neighbourhood. 
Cooperatives are “autonomous associations of persons united voluntarily to 
meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations 
through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise” 
(International Cooperative Alliance). In cooperatives, economic benefits are 
distributed proportionally to each member’s level of participation in the 
cooperative. Democratic decision-making in cooperatives implies each member 
with one vote, no matter how big their financial contribution. Cooperatives 
were an important organisational form in the 1970s but in the decades after 
they lost their relevance and popularity. In the 2010s, cooperatives are 
increasingly popular again as new, non-speculative and non-extractive forms of 
economy are sought by community initiatives across the world.

Relying on its local network with residents and other associations created in the 
past  years,  Largo  has  effectively  constituted  a  welfare  net  that  takes  care  of 
vulnerable  residents  when  it  comes  to  evictions  or other  destabilising  life 
situations.  For  many  local  residents,  joining  activities  organised  by  Largo  was 
conceived as an empowerment process, with increasing personal security, as well 
as new networking and job opportunities.  
"People joined Largo’s projects also to improve their self-esteem: as they 
were from Intendente, they felt the right to be there, they had something 
to say about their place, and values to share." Helène Veiga Gomes 
Largo’s employment policies  have  also  contributed  to  social  integration.  The 
organisation has created a variety of employment opportunities for people living 
in Intendente, mostly in the cafeteria and the hotel. As of today, Largo employs 
15 workers, 80-90% of whom live in the neighbourhood, and 30% coming from a 
highly vulnerable social situation. Out of the 15 employees, 6 and a half people 
work  in  the  cafeteria,  5  and  a  half  in  accommodation  and  3  in  the  cultural 
department. Additional projects and festivals allow Largo to occasionally employ 
more people.  
By  providing  training  and  jobs – and  sometimes  helping  them  formalise  their 
residence or citizenship status – Largo Residências has helped several vulnerable 
people  change  their  lives  and  welcomed  them  in  a  community  that  treasures 
equality and personal empowerment.  
"We intend to grow and to involve more people." Marta Silva 
Besides  conducting  its  own  activities,  Largo  Residências  has  been  engaged  in 
advocating  for  social  inclusion  policies.  Some  of  these  activities  urge  local 
government  to  work  together  with  local  institutions  that  come  from  the  social 
inclusion  field  and  are  connected  with  local  needs  so  that  local  residents  can 
contribute to decisions about public matters. Through the local GABIP structure, 
Largo  has  advanced  a  law  proposal  to  empower  the  elderly,  people  who  are 
isolated and who are often victims of exploitation and fraud. At the local as well as 
at the national level, Largo has been advocating for housing-related legislation. 
Largo members are working on a new institution of cooperative housing to design 
processes of cooperativism in the city centre.  
"Largo is an important connector that can boost and organise people and 
civil society and can interact with important social movements. They try to 
put  housing  rights  into  the  mainstream  political  and  social  agenda.”  Luis 
Mendes 
Largo  Residências  also  had  an  impact  on  municipal  policies  related  to  tourism. 
Approved in October 2019, a new regulation established a ban on new tourism 
facilities in  Lisbon’s  historical  areas.  However,  tourism  facilities  that  reuse  a 
formerly  vacant  building  and  accommodate  social  and  cultural  projects  for  local 
development and housing, are exempt from this ban. Clearly, the regulation has 
been  inspired  by  Largo  Residências,  aiming  at  limiting  extractive  real  estate 
speculation  and  promoting  a  new,  more  sustainable  and  responsible  logic  of 
tourism.  
Locally, Largo Residências has received approval both by the City Hall, with which 
the organisation has established a channel of continuous open dialogue, and the 
local community. Occasionally, however, Largo has been criticized for assisting the 
gentrification of Intendente.

"Our  response  to  criticism  is  that  gentrification  is  based  on  substituting 
classes.  And  our  project  did  not  substitute  classes;  it  tries  to  help  people 
who were evicted to stay here.” Tiago Mota Saraiva Saraiva 
12 The Largo Residências model  
Largo   Residências   has   been   identified  as   an   example   of good   practice 
connecting  the  cultural  sector  and  social  inclusion.  Largo's  cooperative 
project  is  considered  a  vanguard  model  of  economic  sustainability  because  its 
implementation  preserves  the  harmony  with  the  various  dimensions  of  social 
sustainability.  For  this  reason,  it  has  been  featured  in  the "Policy  Handbook  on 
Promotion of Creative Partnerships” published by the European Union.  
Using  its  visibility  at  the  local  and  international  scene,  Largo  has  developed  a 
variety of local and international partnerships that also helped in promoting more 
inclusive  development  policies  including  the  right  to  housing,  non-speculative 
urban   development,   social   economy   and   responsible   tourism.   Joining   the 
re:Kreators and Placemaking  Europe networks  helped  Largo  participate  in 
international policy discussions and have an impact on the European Union’s Urban 
Agenda discussion.  
“Largo is special because it makes the connection between the global forces 
and external threats or opportunities that come to this part of the city and 
those  forces  and  the  local  organisations  we  already  have  in  Largo.”  Luis 
Mendes

Introduction 
The so-called Jewish District is a historical neighborhood in the center of Budapest. 
Recently  it  has  also  been  known  as  the  “Party  District”  or  “Ruin  Bar  District” 
referring  to  a  phenomenon  that  emerged  around  2000  when  courtyards  of 
dilapidated  empty  buildings  signed  for  demolition  were  turned  into  combined 
hospitality and cultural venues. Ruin bars bringing life to the run-down district still 
in need of revitalization a decade after the fall of Socialism became very popular 
among locals and tourists, and since the 2010s grew into a mass phenomenon. 
The district is now in the focus of interest of investors, and its economic, social, 
and  cultural  profile  has  changed to a  great  extent,  including  problems  such  as 
gentrification  and  overtourism.  The  preservation,  renovation, and  uses  of  the 
historical building stock lead to questions about heritage values and processes as 
well as the roles of various stakeholders in this respect. The case study chosen 
from among  the  inhabitants  of  the  historical  buildings  in  the Jewish  District, 
Szimpla Kert, is one of the first ruin bars, with a clear vision about the district as 
a livable place where social diversity, inclusiveness, empowerment, and cultural 
heritage is respected and sustained.

2 Story 
2.1 History of the Jewish District 
The  inner  part  of  the  7
th
 district  of  Budapest,  also  called  Jewish  District,  is  the 
result of a long historical development rooted mostly in the late eighteenth and 
first half of the nineteenth century. Merchants and artisans who were not allowed 
to settle down within the city walls of Pest, started to build their dwellings in this 
area (Perczel  2007,  17).  Though  it  was  a  multiethnic  and  multireligious 
neighborhood, the most significant group was constituted by the Jews: before the 
second world war, 30% of the population was Jewish (Locsmándi 2011, 184). Many 
of them built houses that had small workshops or factories in the courtyards and 
on the ground floors. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the district 
was  a  typical  commercial  neighborhood  spotted  with  characteristic  Jewish 
buildings, such as synagogues, schools, and baths. 
During the second world war, a large part of the district was turned into the Jewish 
Ghetto.  Many  of  the  Jews  of Pest  fell  victim  to  the  Holocaust,  and  from  among 
those  who  survived,  many  decided  to leave  the  country  after  the war.  All  these 
events,  as  well  as  the  Socialist  nationalization  of  the  buildings  and  enterprises, 
largely   damaged   Jewish   culture,   even   though   one   of   the   largest   Jewish 
communities in Central-Eastern Europe still lives here (Egedy and Smith 2016, 96-
97).  After  the  houses  became  state  property,  they  were  not  maintained 
appropriately anymore, and a decline in the inhabitant’s social status accompanied 
the  deterioration  of  the  buildings. By  the  1980s,  the  former  glory of  the district 
significantly faded. 
2.2 The Jewish District after 1990 
The  collapse  of  Communism  in  Hungary  in  1989  opened  the  way  for  the 
privatization of real estate. In the second half of the 1990s, the local municipality 
came up with plans to redevelop the district by significantly changing the existing 
housing  stock,  including  several  demolition  orders (Polyák  2006).  Many  new 
owners  were  speculators  who  were  not  interested  in  renovating  the  historical 
buildings but demolished them and erected new, usually cheap, and low-quality 
ones instead, which did not match the streetscape (Csanádi et al. 2011, 205).

Speculative investors purchased several properties and waited for an increase in 
real estate prices, and these buildings were left empty for years, even after their 
privatization (Smith et al. 2018, 535). The general bad condition of the old building 
stock inhabited by the residents was combined with serious social problems, while, 
due to the demolishing trend, the district started to lose its former architectural 
and aesthetic character. 
This was noticed by a small group of heritage experts who launched a project to 
survey and document the historical building stock, and they discovered that Jewish 
intangible  heritage  had  survived  there  in  a  previously  unknown  and  significant 
extent (Perczel 2005). They turned to the National Office of Cultural Heritage and 
UNESCO in order to protect, preserve, and present the heritage of the district, and 
in 2004, they established a civic organization called ÓVÁS! (the word meaning both 
Veto and Protection). In 2002, a large part of the area labeled as the Old Jewish 
Quarter  of  Pest  became  the  buffer  zone  of  the  UNESCO  World  Heritage  site  of 
Andrássy  Road.  The  National  Office  of  Cultural  Heritage  declared  the  Jewish 
Quarter an area of heritage significance in 2004, and 2005, a large set of buildings 
were  certified as  protected  monuments.  However,  the  protected  status  did  not 
prevent the demolition or significant reconstruction of buildings either, even if the 
process slowed down. What is more, the UNESCO World Heritage site status was 
associated  with  the  rapid  development  of  tourism  and  fueled  speculative 
expectations. By 2007, almost 40% of the 19
th
-century buildings were destroyed, 
and, though now there are many more tools in the hand of heritage protectionists, 
they still do not see the situation as satisfactory (Perczel 2007, 13).

2.3 From Jewish District to Party District 
Parallel  with  these  processes,  a  new  phenomenon  emerged  that  brought 
international fame for the district and placed it as a “must” to the tourists’ map: 
the ruin bars.  
RUIN BARS 
Ruin bars emerged after 2000 in the courtyards of dilapidated empty buildings 
signed for demolition, sometimes even under obscure legal circumstances. They 
were established by artists and intellectuals based on their private capital, as 
venues for an alternative, non-conformist, non-consumerist underground culture. 
Ruin bars, such as Szimpla, Szóda, Sirály, Mumus, became very popular among 
the locals. They organized concerts, art exhibits, theater plays, literary events, 
and Sirály even operated a small library.

A new sub-culture emerged, which also gave space to initiatives 
connecting to the Jewish culture. Ruin bars brought life to the district and used the 
special atmosphere of the dilapidated buildings for their benefit: this provided the 
essence  of  the aesthetics  and  atmosphere.  Another  advantage  of  the  historical 
buildings was their spatial organization, with wings around inner courtyards, the 
latter being perfect spaces for small communities to gather (Lugosi et al. 2010). 
The first ruin bars rented the places for a nominal cost (Lugosi et al. 2010, 3086; 
Molnár  2019a). Soon, both  the  municipality  and  private  real-estate  owners 
recognized  the  potential  in  the  growing  popularity  of  the  bars  and  the  entire 
district. The municipality pushed out the ruin bars from their properties in order to 
be to able sell the latter. Renting the buildings to such bars was an easy way to 
benefit the speculators who had no resources to invest in the renovation or were 
stopped by the success of monument protectionists (Marques and Richards 2014, 
107).  This  temporary  reuse  without  renovation  saved  a  part  of  the  historical 
building stock in a period of uncertainty. Buildings occupied by ruin bars were not 
demolished  or  altered  in  the  years  of  most  intense  speculation,  and  this was  a 
solution to keep a fair level of maintenance (Perczel 2019). 
The ground floors of the buildings were empty. There was no life at all. When the 
first ruin bars opened, Szimpla and Szóda, we were thrilled, they brought life here. 
It was good for the district; we felt that these were positive changes. They were 
able to move into the houses which were not allowed to be demolished any more 
due to our initiative [ÓVÁS] and the interference by the UNESCO. (Perczel 2019) 
Tourists very soon discovered ruin bars, and the district became a target for foreign 
visitors. Nightlife intensified to an extreme level in the district, and a huge market 
evolved for tourist accommodation, a new field for developers. Airbnb and hostels 
became a mass phenomenon in the Jewish District as well as in the nearby areas 
by  the  early  2010s  (Pinke-Sziva  et  al.  2019,  6).  Property  and  rental  prices 
skyrocketed, and ruin bars also had to generate substantial revenues to pay the 
market rents, so they had to switch to a more economically sustainable model. A 
second wave of the ruin bars appeared in the summer of 2010, and these were 
more for-profit enterprises compared to the pioneers in this field (Csanádi et al. 
2011).

The  character of  the  district  has  changed  since  then,  and it  is  called  by its  new 
name  now  as  the  “party  district”  of  Budapest  (Smith  et  al.  2018,  532-533). 
Overtourism became a serious problem, similarly to other capitals in Europe, and 
the  original  inhabitants  are  moving  out  because  the  side-effects  of  nightlife  are 
unbearable for them. Gentrification seems to be an unstoppable process, and the 
local municipality is not able to handle efficiently any of these problems (Csanádi, 
Csizmady, and Olt 2011). 
Meanwhile, the concept of ruin bar changed too, and the old ones – even those 
established around 2010 – are closing one by one year by year. There are only a 
few places still fighting to keep their original mission and character and to keep 
the district as a livable place. Among these, Szimpla is the most influential one, a 
bar  successfully  operating  in  a  protected monument  building  for  15  years  now, 
that became a world celebrity and a serious stakeholder in the discussions about 
the future of this historical district of Budapest. 
3 Policy context 
Right  after  the  end  of  the  Socialist  era,  the  local  district  municipalities  got  a 
significant autonomy within Budapest in terms of urban development. The districts 
were authorized to develop their planning documents and building codes, and they 
also received the duty of post-Socialist rehabilitation of the neglected urban space 
(Polyák 2006; Kovács 2009; Locsmándi 2011, 144; Smith et al. 2018). 
It is the policy of the local municipality that determines the level and character of 
urban regeneration in the district. In contrast with the districts that apply an active 
strategy or provide limited support, the 7
th
 district chose a “hands-off approach” 
or “non-planning” strategy, which was a passive attitude that relied very much on 
the   market.   The   local   municipality   did   not   think   strategically   about   the 
development of the district before investors appeared in the late 1990. For about

a decade, the demolition of historical buildings and the erection 
of  new  buildings  were  based  on  ad  hoc  decisions,  and  the  legal  and  planning 
framework  of  urban  development  was  missing (Kovács  et  al.  2013,  26,  31-32; 
Smith et al. 2018). This was a serious problem in a situation that was chaotic in 
terms of ownership and responsibilities. 
Many  buildings  quickly  got  to  private  ownership, often  under  questionable 
circumstances. Developers took over the control soon, and they started to move 
out of the  residents,  which  paved  the  way  to  the  process  of  gentrification 
(Locsmándi 2011, 171-172, Kovács et al. 2013, 32). The district adopted a local 
planning  and  building  code, but  it  was  highly  open  for  negotiations  (Locsmándi 
2011,  146).  The  local  development  plan  created  in  1999  contained  several 
demolition orders (Polyák 2006). This, combined with a high level of corruption, 
quickly  lead  to  serious  damage  in  the  urban  fabric  and  the  escalation  of  social 
problems. 
Changes in the official heritage status of the area and specific buildings from 2002, 
2004, and 2005 forced the municipality to deal with the issue but did not stop the 
demolishing for a while, and neither did it solve the problem of conservation and 
substandard living conditions in the historical buildings. These later served as the 
basis of arguments by the municipality on social development and slum-clearing 
(Polyák  2006, Csanádi  et  al.  2011,  Perczel  2019).  Buildings  with  apartments 
purchased  by  their  former  tenants  represent  another  special  problem:  the 
residents should take care of the renovation with the help of city- and district-level 
financial support programs, which do not prove to provide sufficient help (Kovács 
et al. 2013, 26; Bodó 2019). As a result of these processes, in the Jewish District, 
20-40% of the buildings have been renovated between 1989 and 2013, while in 
other districts of the city center, this is even more than 75% (Kovács 2013, 26, 
fig. 2). 
In  2015,  the  district  municipality  issued  a  long-term  Settlement  Development 
Concept  for  2014-2030 and  a  mid-term  Integrated  Settlement  Development 
Strategy for 2014-2020 to address all these issues. They defined the vision of the 
municipality  about  the  district  as  an  area  providing  high-quality  life  conditions, 
urban  services, and favorable environmental conditions for various generations, 
with a touristic offer based on its rich built and intangible heritage. Cooperation, 
climate consciousness, and solidarity are defined as the main values. To deal with 
historical building stock, they intend to maintain the financial support framework 
for renovations and to establish a support program developing suitable technical 
solutions.  The  document accentuates the  importance  of  the  historical  cityscape 
and  the  variability  in  the  functions  and  puts  emphasis  on  keeping  the  dwelling 
functions to avoid a “Skansen” effect. Development areas include the elaboration 
of a  methodology  for  protecting  the  complex  heritage  and  for  the  energetical 
renovation of historical buildings. 
The  Strategy  defined  the  mid-term  goals  for  development  as  improving  living 
conditions  and  reducing  the  conflicts  by  respecting  the  historical  architectural 
environment,  promoting  tourism  and  creative  economy,  and  increasing  the 
cohesion  of  the  local  society.  The  planned  interventions  in  the  Jewish  District 
include the renovation of public spaces with participatory planning, the renovation 
of houses, mostly protected monuments, and the rehabilitation of Jewish memorial

sites.  The  interventions  are  partly  tasks  for  the  municipality, 
partly  require  the  development  of a partnership  with  the  private  sector, 
condominium owners, and cultural and church organizations. The municipality also 
aims to develop the local identity by educating the new residents and visitors about 
the history and culture of the district. 
The  Settlement  Image  Decree  and  Settlement Image  Manual  accepted  in  2017, 
and a new Local Building Code from 2018 regulates the construction activities in 
the district. The aim is formulated in accordance with the strategic documents: the 
sustainable and organic development of the historical district and the protection of 
its values. It is, however, not clear what they define as values besides the legally 
protected sites and how decisions are made upon them. Owners and developers 
have  a  reporting  obligation towards  the  municipality,  and  in  the  case of 
constructions and demolitions, special local permission is needed in addition to the 
regular permissions, but the actual choices are very much upon the discretion of 
the designing architect and the chief architect of the municipality. 
The local development strategy also recognizes the danger of the domination of 
low-quality hospitality industry and suggests a strict control over the profile of new 
businesses in the Jewish District. Ruin bars have been in focus due to their conflicts 
with the residents since their popularity rose. The Hungarian legislation favors the 
entrepreneurs  in  these  situations,  so the  municipality  was  forced  to  handle  the 
problem (Smith  et  al. 2018,  537-539).  After  several  attempts  to  restrict  the 
opening hours by a municipal decision, finally, a referendum was held in the 7
th
 
district  on  the  issue in  2019, which,  however,  was  unsuccessful due  to  the  low 
number  of  participants  (Szabó  2018). Another  method  tried  by  the  district 
leadership was to change the profile of the area. The local government initiated 
the project “The Street of Culture” in 2010 with EU funding aimed to renovate and 
re-profile Kazincy Street, one of the core areas of nightlife. 
Local elections held in 2019 November created a new situation since the leadership 
of the district and the capital was taken over by the political opposition after a long 
period. The expectations towards the new team are to take up an initiating role, 
to play a more significant role in managing the conflicts, and to move the district 
closer to the strategic goals by developing strong partnerships between the mainj 
stakeholders. 
4 The social and economic transformation of 
the  Jewish  District:  a  space  of  multiple 
conflicts 
Ruin bars emerged and flourished in the niche that appeared due to the tensions 
between urban decay, protected heritage, and private investment (Lugosi  et  al. 
2010). Starting from the use of dilapidated buildings, the area became a creative 
hub, now dominated by restaurants, bars, design shops, galleries, museums, and 
festivals.  In  the  small  area  of  walking  distance, there  were  180  restaurants,  31 
ruin bars, 25 hotels, 15 galleries, 22 design shops according to a survey in 2014 
(Marques and Richards 2014, 105), and these numbers have surely increased since

then.  The  growth of the global  tourism  industry,  especially  fast 
tourism  favored  by  low-cost airlines, contributed  to  the  international  success  of 
the hospitality industry in the district, and ruin pubs defined it as a primary target 
for tourists within Budapest (Smith et al. 2018, 537).

Urban  rehabilitation  and  the  success  of  the  hospitality  industry  caused  rapid 
demographic and social changes in the district. The increasing economic value of 
the  neighborhood  determined  the  process  of  gentrification.  It  forced  out low-
income residents due to the increased cost of rent and higher cost of goods as well 
as  to  the  laissez-faire  urban  development  policy  of  the  district  municipality. 
Younger families with a background in creative industries are replacing households 
with  elderly  people  and  from  lower  social classes.  The  popularity  of  the  district 
among tourists led to a boom of short-term rental services. Proliferation of services 
like Airbnb and Booking.com catalyzed the process. Around 2,000 apartments are 
rented out in this form in the 7th district, about a fifth part of those in the entire 
Budapest (Molnár 2019b). Many houses have hardly any registered residents, and 
even those often stay for a few years only, then move on. Traditional neighborhood 
communities  have  been dissolved,  social  ties  damaged,  and  this  process  is 
irreversible  now (Settlement  Development  Concept  for  2014-2030,  10; Pinke-
Sziva et al. 2019, Smith et al. 2019). As one of the local shop owners says, 
Only Airbnb is here; everyone moves away from here... It has a very bad effect on 
the traditional residents of the street, many who rented here move away... It is a 
bit painful to see that three or four families move away from this [Kazinczy] street 
every year because it is impossible to live in these houses due to the Airbnb guests. 
(Rácz 2019)

Tensions and conflicts have emerged between, but also within the 
main  groups  of  stakeholders: residents,  real-estate  developers,  hospitality 
enterprises, heritage protectionists, and the local government.  
Developers versus  residents. In  the  period  of  post-Socialist  privatization, 
developers  faced  problems  when  evicting  the  inhabitants,  and  the  process  was 
problematic both in legal and ethical terms. Urban rehabilitation in the district was 
focused  on  physical  renovation.  It was  determined  by  the  interests  of  the  real 
estate developers; the interests of the residents were barely considered. Residents 
in those buildings which were not sold to developers are not able to finance the 
renovation  of  the  old  buildings; their  living  conditions  are  below  the  modern 
standards. Inequality increased: the district is a mixture of luxury apartments and 
slums often within the same streets.

inhabited by residents who lack the funding to renovate it (right), both on Király Street. Photo: Dóra Mérai  
Developers  versus  heritage  protectionists. Developers  were  not  very  much 
interested in heritage values unless they could monetize them; both they and the 
municipality  saw  potential  in  the  UNESCO  label  in  this  respect.  Investors  were 
often speculators who did not buy to develop but to wait for the prices go up and 
did  not  spend  on  maintaining  the  historical  building  stock  which  was  quickly 
deteriorating. They also started to demolish the old buildings and build new houses 
which did not match the historical streetscape. Damaging the buildings took other 
forms  too,  for  example,  by  keeping  the  façade  but  demolishing  the  structure 
behind it or adding new floors on the top of old buildings. Heritage specialists and 
civic activists stood up against these trends and were successful in stopping some 
physical changes  in  the  building  stock  but  not  others.  There  seems  to  be  no 
compromise between the two parties. 
Hospitality   entrepreneurs   versus   the   local   government.   Enterprises 
contribute to the local budget with significant sums, but they are not satisfied with 
the service they receive in exchange: the cleanliness of public areas, public safety 
in  the  streets,  and  the  presence  of petty criminals  disturb  their  clientele  and 
employees.  They  would  expect  a  more  pro-active  attitude  on  behalf  of  the 
municipality in solving the infrastructural problems too (Molnár 2019a). 
Heritage protectionists versus local government. The local government has 
argued for the modernization of the district, and they have seen the construction 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
The Jewish District of Budapest 
14 
 
of new buildings and the reconstruction of historical ones as a part 
of  that.  Heritage  activists  (lead  by  the  NGO  ÓVÁS!)  have  been  fighting  against 
these processes to preserve the values of the area. The protected status achieved 
by  heritage  activists  was  first  seen  by  the  municipality  as  an  obstacle  to  the 
revitalization endeavors intended to address the social problems in the district and 
as a factor to alienate developers (Polyák 2006). The  “price”  for protection  was 
that  the  local  government  could  not  develop  some  areas,  and  around  3,000 
residents  stayed  in  their  comfortless  apartments,  which  indicates  a  conflict 
between the residents versus heritage protectionists too. 
Residents versus the local government. The absence of strategy on behalf of 
the municipality resulted in the unequal development of the district. Many buildings 
are  still  dilapidated,  and  streets  are  neglected.  The  local  government  cannot 
control the damage of nightlife and overtourism on the quality of life in the district. 
Residents  would  expect  a  more  efficient  strategy  from  the municipality  in  this 
respect. The civic initiative called Élhető Erzsébetvárosért (For a Livable Elizabeth 
Town) pushed the district government to organize a referendum on the opening 
hours  in  2018,  and  they  entered  the  scene  of  local  elections  too  with  their  own 
candidates in 2019 October. 
Residents versus hospitality entrepreneurs. The biggest problem is the late-
night noise, littering, and the misbehavior of visitors (Smith et al. 2018, 535-536). 
Drugs, prostitution appeared in the streets. Residents in houses with Airbnb flats 
suffer from the movement of tourists with suitcases. This conflict also appears in 
terms  of locals  versus  foreigners,  even  though  many  foreigners are  owners and 
residents in the area. The residents do not benefit from the success of business in 
the area in terms of their quality of life. 
Aforementioned  groups  of  stakeholders are  not  homogeneous,  but  there  are 
conflicts even within them. For example, there is a conflict between the “socially-
responsible” (first generation) bars, such as Szimpla, and the new ones that exploit 
the  model  to  make  as  much  profit  as  possible  with  little  concerns  about  the 
consequences for the neighborhood: 
There are many bars which are profit-oriented: they are going for volume, they are 
going for tourists who drink a lot, who drink to be as drunk as possible. And then 
the residents of the 7th district have a very negative image about all the bars. It is 
bad for both the residents and the businesses, and it spoils the reputation of the 
industry. (Molnár 2019a) 
5 Heritage in the Jewish District 
5.1 Built heritage 
Discourse on heritage in the Jewish District started in the second half of the 1990s 
when the first heritage professionals launched an inventory work to act against the 
demolishing and rebuilding plans of the district government. Research and public 
discussion focused only on built and tangible heritage. The success of the combined 
professional and civic campaign also affected these: in 2002, the Jewish District 
became the buffer zone of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, then, in 2004, became 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
The Jewish District of Budapest 
15 
 
a  heritage  area  also  protected  by  the  Hungarian  law (Perczel 
2019).  Mostly  due  to  the  protection  campaign  in  2004  and  2005,  currently  65 
buildings in the Jewish District have official monument (műemlék) status: 63 at 
the national level and 2 within the district (Perczel 2019). One of the latter, a one-
story building with a garden at 8 Nagy Diófa Street, was assigned for demolition, 
but the residents objected, so the district issued a heritage protection decree about 
this house (Perczel 2019). The civic association ÓVÁS! is an important supporter 
of such bottom-up initiatives and played a crucial role in achieving protected status 
for various sites and buildings. Supported by a massive civic basis, they also have 
an  important  monitoring  role.  In  2006  they  were  the  ones  who  turned  to  the 
UNESCO World Heritage Committee and signaled that the developments endanger 
the  built  heritage  in  the  district.  The  Committee  sent  a mission  to  examine  the 
situation,  and,  based  on  the  report,  expressed  its  concern  and  laid  down  some 
suggestions  for  the  local  and  national  government  (UNESCO  World  Heritage 
Committee 2008). 
5.2 Jewish heritage 
The ÓVÁS! association, had a leading role in recognition of the area as a “Jewish 
District.” They promote the research and presentation of the intangible heritage 
as well, which is the target of their more recent projects but focusing only on the 
Jewish past (Török 2013; “Kik éltek, kik építettek itt?”). Jewish intangible heritage 
has  been  explored  by  other projects as  well  in  the  framework  of  Jewish  studies 
(Frojimovics et al. 1998). 
As I went from house to house, the inhabitants told me that only Jews had lived 
there before [WWII], only the janitor was Christian or the servants. In every third 
or fourth house, there was a Jewish, kosher slaughterhouse, bakery, meat smoker, 
and on the upper floors, there were prayer rooms and synagogues. (Perczel 2019)

JEWISH BUDAPEST 
From the mid-nineteenth century, the district hosted one of Europe’s largest 
Jewish communities The bulk of the Jewish inhabitants of Budapest disappeared 
due to the Holocaust and the emigration afterward, but after 1990, Jewish 
presence became more visible in the district. Today 45-90,000 Jews live in 
Hungary, and 80-90% live in Budapest, not exclusively in this district (Egedy and 
Smith, 2016). 
There  is  a  Jewish  religious  community  today  visible  through  their  buildings, 
practices,  cultural  institutions,  and  characteristic  representatives  in  the  streets. 
However, there is another type of Jewish community among the residents, who do 
not necessarily practice their religion, and who have preserved their identity at a 
varying level. They are important carriers of local intangible heritage and are being 
pushed out these years by the new developmental trends. 
The  third  form  of  defining  the  Jewishness  of  the  district  in  terms  of  heritage  is 
Jewish heritage tourism that emerged after 2000. This process also contributed to 
the  concept  of  the  Jewish  District  of  Pest  and  fits  into  the  European  trend  of 
creation and heritagization of Jewish spaces, such as in Prague or Krakow (Gruber 
2009, Gantner 2014, Walkowitz 2018). Jewish thematic guided tours and online 
applications  are  offered  in  this  part  of  Budapest,  Jewish  cuisine  flourishes,  and 
there has been a Jewish Cultural Festival organized every summer since 2015.  
Jewish  heritage  tourism  is  closely  interlinked  with  the  cultivation  of  Jewish 
memorial sites and the memory of Holocaust victims and the Ghetto both by the 
Jewish religious community and by the heritage protectionists, professionals, and 
activists. The last intact remain of the Ghetto wall located at 15 Király Street was 
demolished in 2006 despite the  protest  of  the  residents.  The  ÓVÁS!  association 
achieved  that  in  2010, the  wall  was  rebuilt,  and  a  memorial  plaque  was  placed 
there in the framework of a ceremony, which has been a target of Jewish heritage 
tourism ever since then. 
5.3 Intangible heritage 
The problem of built heritage and intangible heritage in the district often appears 
in  an  artificial  separation,  especially  in  the  public  discourse,  where  mostly built 
heritage is the focus of concern, while layers of intangible heritage other than (old 
and  post-2000)  Jewish  traditions  are  not  recognized  at  all. Together  with  the 
residents, the intangible heritage of everyday life in the district also disappears, 
especially those of low-social-status and marginalized groups, but also traditional 
professions.  
Disappearing   crafts   should   be   brought   back   and   re-established,   such   as 
clockmaking,  goldsmith- and  leatherwork,  and  their  representatives  should  be 
helped to pursue these professions for which there is still a need. People are pushed 
out from the market because they have the knowledge, but they do not have the 
management skills to commercialize that... When this district was a Jewish District, 
it was about professions, and it also had its cultural side. There was a very rich life 
here. (Bodó 2019)

Since  built  heritage  is  more  than  just  the  architecture,  but 
includes all kinds of intangible aspects, such as the uses of spaces and buildings, 
the related practices, communities, and ideas – all of which change together with 
the  ever  changing  social  environment –,  the  heritage  profile  of  the  district  has 
significantly transformed since the 1990s. A new layer of heritage evolved with the 
appearance of ruin bars, their unique atmosphere, and the related groups and their 
activities, which is also disappearing now with the process of gentrification in the 
area. It is not just the original residents of the houses that are pushed out, but 
also  the  first,  special,  local,  and  unique  wave  of the 21
st
-century  hospitality 
industry – paradoxically, due to its immense success – as a result of which the 
area loses its unique appeal. Only a few actors have recognized the danger of this 
process in the Jewish District and developed a strategic way of thinking and acting 
about it, and the most visible of whom is Szimpla.

Szimpla is the oldest ruin bar in the Jewish district now, and it is conscious about 
the heritage they curate both in tangible and intangible terms. They also have an 
understanding  of how  heritage  can  contribute  to  creating a  better  life  in  the 
neighborhood, and they connect various groups of stakeholders in the district and 
beyond who share their vision. 
6.1 The story of Szimpla 
The history of Szimpla started in 2001 when Gábor Bertényi, Márk Gauder, Attila 
Kiss,  and Ábel  Zsendovits established  a  small  bar  on  Kertész  Street  in  the  7
th
 
district  of  Budapest.  The  founders  were  not  professionals  in  the  hospitality 
industry;  they  had degrees in  social  sciences and art.  This  background  brought 
new aspects to hospitality practices in Budapest: they aimed to establish a cultural 
and  community  center  with  a  variety  of  cultural  and  social  programs  (Molnár 
2019b). 
In 2002 they opened the first Szimpla Kert, an open-air venue in an inner courtyard 
on  Király  Street,  which  in  2004  moved  to 14 Kazinczy  Street,  a  dilapidated 
nineteenth-century  house  that  is  now  a  protected  monument  (Somlyódy 2007, 
Molnár 2019b). Step by step, they made their home in the building, which became 
an iconic feature of the world-famous bar.

Szimpla was very popular among Budapest’s residents and tourists from the very 
beginning at each of its venues, but the real international fame came in 2012 when 
Lonely Planet included it to the list of best bars in the world (Ruinpubs.com; Velkey 
2016). As  a  result,  Szimpla and  ruin  bars, in general, became a primary target 
among foreign tourists, and the number of visitors has been growing ever since 
then (Molnár 2019). 
Popularity and economic success had its price. Overcrowdedness, the growing level 
of   noise   and   garbage,   and   criminals   attracted   by   tourists   damaged   the 
relationships between the ruin bars and the local communities. Szimpla and other 
ruin  bars  had  to  elaborate  a  new  strategy on how  to  keep  their  economic 
sustainability, preserve good relations with the residents, and preserve their core 
values. As Bence Molnár, the head of the Office for Communication of Szimpla put 
it: 
The original concept was not just a bar. It was opened by people who wanted to 
have  a  place  for  community  meetings  and  cultural  programs.  Of  course,  the 
founders  considered  making a profit;  economic  sustainability  was  part  of  the 
concept from the very beginning. However, the idea of having a community place 
open to everybody was an essential part of the concept as well. The mission has 
not  changed  since  then.  What  has  changed  is  the  popularity  and  the  number  of 
people who are coming here. (Molnár 2019b) 
The  owners  opened  further  venues  in  Budapest  and  elsewhere  in  Hungary, but 
none of these became as successful as Szimpla Kert in Kazinczy Street. The latter 
inspired a family-oriented café in Vác, a small town north of Budapest, two places 
in Berlin, and Szimpla Szentgyörgy in Sfântu Gheorghe, Romania.

6.2 Values and mission of the enterprise 
The  vision  of  Szimpla from  the  very  beginning  was  to  be  an  organization  that 
gathers  creative  people,  hosts  cultural  events, welcomes  civil  movements,  and 
gives space to everyone to meet and share cultural experiences. On its website 
(szimpla.hu), Szimpla defines itself as a “post-modern culture center,” a “cultural 
reception space,” and a “civic base.” They also emphasize the importance of social 
responsibly:  “We  are  committed  to  local  communities, livable cities, and  the 
environment” (Szimpla.   Guide   to   Budapest & Hungary).   Bence   Molnár 
communications director explains the priorities of the enterprise as follows:  
We organize art; we target people who are interested in new things, original things, 
creative  things  in  music,  fine  arts,  and any  kind  of  interactive  cultural  program. 
With the civil movements and fairs, we are trying to pick directions that we feel are 
very much needed. (Molnár 2019b) 
Though Szimpla is one of the most popular bars in Europe, selling food and drinks 
for  them  is only  a  means  to  ensure  the  financial  background  for  their  cultural 
events and community services, and they put the latter on the top in the hierarchy 
of the enterprise’s values. Their website talks  about  a  “Szimpla lifestyle,” which 
“...is  brought  to  life  by culture,  creativity  and  constant  change  day  by  day ...” 
Szimpla defines its mission as  
Shaping our environment, making it more livable and human-friendly by searching 
for the cultural treasures of Hungary and the world, by introducing and managing 
creative talents and their products, and by implementing and operating models that 
help sustainable development in many ways of life. (Molnár 2019b)

However,  with  economic  success  and  changes  in  the  local  urban  context – not 
independent from the former factor – it became a challenge for Szimpla to preserve 
its core values and mission. The bar started to attract crowds of people thirsty for 
amusement who do not share Szimpla’s values but go there to see a place on the 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2

tourists’ “must visit” list of instagrammable sites. To promote its 
values more efficiently, the owners established a Communication Office in 2015, 
which is focused entirely on social and cultural programs and the communication 
with the public; more than 20 employees work now in this field. Profitability is still 
essential for Szimpla; it is a for-profit enterprise. However, profit does not always 
determine  the  behavior  of  the  organization.  Bence  Molnár  emphasizes  their 
priorities: 
Our  task  is  to  preserve  our  core  mission.  That  is  why  we  do  not  follow  the 
mainstream;  we  do  not  always  serve  the  public  needs,  but  rather  give  what  we 
think is essential to give. We want people visiting Szimpla to go with some valuable 
experience, something that changed their minds. (Molnár 2019b) 
In practice, it means that Szimpla established a face-control at the entrance and 
refuses  inviting  guests  whose  only  intention  is  to  get  drunk,  for  example, 
intoxicated bachelor parties, so that their reputation is not ruined by misbehaving 
visitors  (Molnár  2019a).  Szimpla  is  selective  when  it  is  about  customers’  safety 
and  business  ethics,  but  otherwise, it  follows  the  principle  of  openness  and 
inclusiveness,  even  with  some  proactive  elements.  They  try  to  attract various 
layers of the local community, for example, by offering a 50% reduction from the 
price of every drink to pensioners. 
With the art, we are trying to give opportunities to the upcomers, the new ones, 
the young ones, the creative ones. Target audience does not exist in Szimpla, we 
are open for everyone, for every age, for every gender, for every financial status, 
so we do not select specific target audiences for our programs. (Molnár 2019b) 
Szimpla is open towards innovations and applies the most advanced technologies 
in its logistic and financial operations. However, if technologies might damage the 
image  and  atmosphere, they  sacrifice convenience. They  also avoid industrial 
technologies in interior design and furnishing. 
Szimpla  is a non-partisan place;  it does not host events in  support of political 
parties. At the same time, the place promotes certain social and political values 
such  as individual  rights  (including  civil  rights  and  human  rights),  democracy, 
secularism, internationalism, freedom of speech, and orientation towards an open 
and  inclusive society. International  culture and  livability  for  everybody is  an 
integral part of the Szimpla identity:  
“We  are  not  Jewish  or  Hungarian;  we  are  international-eclectic.  Our  vision  is  a 
liveable city, and we contribute to it as much as possible.” (Molnár 2019a) 
6.3 Activities 
Szimpla Kert implements its core values and mission through a variety of activities 
which cover three main areas: 
Culture  and  art are  their  essential  activities.  Szimpla has  its  own  theatre 
company  and  movie  screenings.  It  hosts  music  concerts,  art  exhibitions,  art 
workshops. There are many regular events, such as Hungarian folk dance every 
Monday  night,  free  concerts  every  Tuesday,  Szimpla  Open  Stage  every  Friday. 
Szimpla does not only organize its own events but also offers its premises free of

charge to other organizations for educational and cultural events 
which are aligned with their core values (Molnár 2019a).

Sustainability is promoted by organizing Szimpla Farmers’ Market on Sundays, a 
flea  market,  and  the  Szimpla  Bicycle  workshop.  The  Farmers’  Market  connects 
thousands of urban customers with about 40 farmers offering their products since 
2010. The Szimpla Design Shop upcycles products redesigned by Szimpla. Szimpla 
organizes every month the “Szimpla Bike Circus” where one can buy second-hand 
and  new  bikes,  spare  parts,  and  equipment.  They  provide  with  space  the 
“RideKálmán” bike shop which repairs bikes and donates them to those who cannot 
afford to buy one. Kálmán Rácz, the owner, explains the nature of this cooperation: 
The basis of our cooperation with Szimpla is their moral support that they stand 
behind this cause. It is also very important that they provide me with this space, in 
the heart of Budapest, in one of the inner districts. I also give them something: I 
help  them  run  their  bike  rental  service,  I  keep  their  bikes  running, and  I 
continuously  renovate them.  These  are  bikes  built  by  me,  so these  are the  best 
bikes to rent in Budapest, or at least the fastest ones. They have such a team... if 
all Hungary were like this, it would be a cool place. (Kálmán Rácz, 2019) 
Urban  activism includes  actions aimed  to turn  Szimpla’s  narrow  or  broader 
environment into  a more  livable space. For  example, the  enterprise spends 
monthly  about  900  euros to  clean their street  (Molnár  2019a). They  promote 
various  causes  in  the online  and  social  media  that  relate  to  the  infrastructural 
development,  safety,  and  heritage  of  the district. Szimpla  also  addresses social 
problems above the local relevance: they initiate programs to integrate homeless 
people  back  to  society,  help  children  associations  and animal  shelters (Molnár 
2019b).

Supporting civil movements is one of Szimpla’s priorities. Their approach is “to 
help  where  our  help  is  needed,  and  we  can make  changes.” One  of  their  most 
famous projects is the Kazinczy Living Library initiated in 2015 during the peak of 
the  refugee  crisis  in  Hungary. The  Living  Library was set  up  as  a  space  for 
interaction and debate to promote respect, dialogue, and to challenge stereotypes 
and discrimination between different social groups. Another example is a meet-up 
they hosted for non-Hungarian residents of Budapest in 2019 October to inform 
them about their rights regarding the upcoming local elections.

Depending on the season, about 100-110 employees keep Szimpla running. About 
60 work on the bar, 20 organize events and communicate with the public, and 8 
provide the maintenance of the building (Molnár 2019b). 
6.4 The building, heritage, and adaptive reuse  
The house where Szimpla is currently located in a typical historical building in the 
district. It has been repurposed several times since its erection in 1841. It was 
designed  by  Mihály  Pollack,  the  most  prominent  architect  of  Neo-Classicism  in 
Hungary as a single-story U-shaped urban dwelling house. In 1911 Sándor Héber 
purchased the house and moved his successful oven factory to the courtyard. He 
lengthened the wings of the building and covered the courtyard with a glass roof 
(Perczel 2007, 187-188). The factory operated until the second world war when 
the Jewish owner was deported, and the building became part of Budapest Ghetto.

The  house  stood  empty  from  the  end of the war, except for about two decades 
from the 1970s, when it served as an apartment house for a few families. In the 
1990s, the  local  authorities  decided  to  demolish  the  dilapidated  building  but 
postponed the implementation of their plans due to the activity of the ÓVÁS! Civic 
Association. The building was put under local protection (Perczel 2007, 187-8). It 
was finally sold to a private investor who turned the yard into a parking lot. When 
Szimpla  made  an  offer  to  rent  the  house,  the  owner  chose  this  more profitable 
option, and the ruin bar has used the premises since 2004 (Somlyódy 2007; Molnár 
2019b).  Szimpla  does  not  renovate  the  building  but  takes  care  of  its  proper 
maintenance and safety; it is preserved in the form it survived the Socialist era 
until the bar is there. In 2005 the National Office of Heritage Protection declared 
it a listed monument.

Operating an enterprise which accommodates crowds of visitors in an old building 
purposed for other functions is a challenging endeavor. The managers of Szimpla 
constantly face the problems related to the peculiarities of the house. However, 
they  appreciate  the  size  and ground  plan of  the  building, which creates a “an 
adventurous”   atmosphere. They   apply   various   technological   solutions   to 
counterbalance the disadvantages (Molnár 2019b).

The building is not very convenient and functional for a business 
like  ours,  but  we  must  operate  here  because  it  is an  iconic  building.  It  looks 
mysterious, and it is easy to fill it with stories. (Molnár 2019a) 
 
Figure 14 Interiors of Szimpla. Photo: Dóra Mérai 
The building has become an essential part of corporate history and heritage. Abel 
Zsendovits, one of the founders of Szimpla, acknowledges, that the location and 
“spirit” was a crucial element of Szimpla’s success (Egorova 2014). Today Szimpla 
can host up to 700 visitors at the same time, so thousands go through the place 
every day. They are served by nine bars with a different profile set up at various 
points  of  the  courtyard  and  the  former  apartments.  Guests  are  seated  in  the 
gateway, the inner courtyard, and the rooms on the ground floor and first floor, as 
well as the space of the former factory. The spatial arrangement of the flats can 
still  be  recognized.  The  staff’s  offices  are  in  the  attic,  while  the cellars  are  the 
service  area  for  catering. Szimpla also rents spaces  in  the neighboring building 
since the operation outgrew the original premises (Molnár 2019b).

The  façade  of  Kazincy  14  is  untouched  and  dilapidated,  but 
Szimpla made some changes inside with the permission of the chief architect of 
the district and the Disaster Management Department (Molnár 2019a). These were 
aimed  to  ensure  the  structural  and  operational  safety  of  the  building  and  the 
movement  of  people  and goods. However,  the  added interior  constructions  and 
decorations are all mobile, and they  can  quickly  be  removed  without  any  trace. 
The interiors formed gradually, organically, and they are constantly changing. They 
highlight the beauties of some original details, such as the staircase with its 19
th
-
century cast-iron  rails  featuring winged  figures  (Perczel  2019). There  are  many 
plants in the courtyard and canvas roofs to reduce the outgoing sounds towards 
the neighborhood. 
The  furniture  matches  the  building:  they  used  second-hand  items  and  various 
found  objects  such  as  a  Trabant  car,  old  computers,  lamps,  and  other  trash  or 
treasure-like objects. They also collected some iconic objects from Budapest, and 
many pieces have their own stories. These are combined with artworks, such as 
paintings  and  holograms.  It  was  a  conscious  choice  to  give  a  new  life  to  old 
furniture from the time of opening the very first Szimpla. The owners found this 
kind  of  interior  cozier  and  more  attractive;  they  were  dedicated  to  avoiding 
conscious design. Soon this style emerged as a design trend favored by an urban 
professional  layer  and  was  followed  by  many  other  bars  (Gábor  Bertényi  in 
Somlyódy 2007). 
The  whole  place  is  a  statement  about  sustainability  because  we  are  reusing  the 
building for a completely different purpose. It is also protecting  what  we  already 
have, show it in its originality, but giving it a function, which let people perceive 
other things from the building. The whole thing is about recycling; we recycle the 
entire building. But within the building, we recycle what we find, and people find us 
with their things. People like how we reuse things. (Molnár 2019b) 
Though the first Szimpla came into being by the temporary reuse of an old building, 
Kazinczy  14  was  occupied  and  technically modernized  already  as  the long-term 
home of the enterprise. However, the aesthetics of temporary use were preserved, 
and all developments and modernization are invisible, behind the curtains. By this, 
it is not just the building that is preserved and presented as heritage – maintained 
continuously by an entire technical team – but also the way of use, the intangible 
heritage of the ruin pub culture in the Jewish District of Budapest and of Szimpla 
itself. They preserve the tangible heritage of Szimpla as well, e.g., the two original 
second-hand movie  projectors  of  the  former  Szimpla  Kertmozi.  It  is  used  only 
occasionally, and its maintenance is costly, but they keep it because it is part of 
the Szimpla heritage (Liptay 2019). 
Keeping the ruin aesthetics is, however, problematic from the point of view of the 
building on the long run since renovations from time to time are part of the normal 
lifecycle of a building, as it was the case also with Kacinczy 14 before the second 
world war. Today the façade presents most visibly the risks of Szimpla's approach: 
large parts of the plaster are missing, and the decorative details also threaten with 
the danger of disappearing with time. Since careful maintenance takes place in the 
background,  the  visual  message  of  the  building  is  also  questionable  in  the 
perspective  of  desirable  heritage  conservation  trends  in  general.  Paradoxically, 
freezing  the  time  from  the point of  view  of  built  heritage  is  due  to  the dynamic 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
The Jewish District of Budapest 
27 
 
creation of intangible heritage in this case, since keeping the idea 
of  a  ruin  pub  in  a  long-term  home  means  preserving  the  building  without  any 
renovation. 
Szimpla first presented its premises and activities on the European Heritage Days 
in September 2019. Previously they did research to recover the past of the house 
from documents  and  images  and  the profession of the former inhabitants. They 
also organized a small pop-up exhibition on the 15
th
 anniversary of Szimpla in this 
building, where they presented materials from the past of both the house and the 
enterprise. The importance of intangible heritage was also recognized: the guide 
emphasized that the area was historically characterized by the dense presence of 
hospitality industry, crafts, and commerce, and placed Szimpla and the ruin bars 
in that context (Liptay 2019). 
6.5 Communications and PR 
The communication of Szimpla in the first years of its existence relied on personal 
networks. The personal and online network of the guests and the means of word-
of-mouth is still essential. For four years now, however, the enterprise has a team 
of professionals who organize and communicate the programs towards the visitors, 
residents  in  the  neighborhood,  journalists,  and  the  digital  space. They  follow 
Szimpla’s appearances on the travel, gastronomy, and other blogs and respond to 
the praises and complaints. This team includes a manager dealing with clients with 
special  requests  (e.g.,  reserving  a  separate  room for  an  event). Szimpla  has a 
photographer  and video producer,  and  they make  sure  that  only professional 
images appear  in  their  communication. The  Communication Office does  not 
generate revenues; its task is “to make sure that the social part of the enterprise 
exists and to keep it vibrant and up to date” (Molnár 2019b). 
Szimpla actively uses the online channels of communication, most importantly, the 
website and social media (Table 1). Social media, especially Facebook, is also used 
to communicate with the residents. The latter can complain or raise issues there, 
and the enterprise tries to solve all the reasonable requests (Molnár 2019a, Bodó 
2019).

6.6 Financial model 
Szimpla  Kert  is  a  private  enterprise,  owned  by Szimplacity  Ltd (SzimplaCity 
Szolgáltató Korlátolt Felelősségű Társaság). It is a financially successful enterprise 
that can sustain its core mission. Moreover, it is still growing (Molnár 2019b). The 
enterprise was financially successful from the very beginning, and since then, they 
multiplied the income. Attila Kiss, one of the founders of Szimpla, recalls the first 
success: 
From a business point of view, the first enterprise far exceeded our expectations. 
We  worked  hard;  we  were  there  day  and  night.  We  expected  to  make  30  to  40 
thousand forints a day so that we can get our investments back in a year. We had 
‘survival’ scenarios, but on the second day, we had to throw them away. We made 
hundreds of thousands of forints ..." (cit.: Somlyódy, 2007) 
The net turnover in 2005 was 95 million forints and grew to around 150 million in 
2006 (Somlyódy 2007). In 2018 it reached 1.6 billion, that is c. 4,8 million euros 
(Céginformáció.hu). The enterprise uses a significant part of the income to support 
its cultural and civic programs (the entrance is always free) and to reinvest into 
the  building. By  2007, Szimpla spent  11-12  million  forints  on  culture  per  year 
(Somlyódy 2007). 
The sites of the first two Szimpla were in municipality ownership. The courtyard of 
25 Király Street was rented by them for a small amount, but by next year the plot 
was  sold,  and  the  new  owner  moved  out  Szimpla.  They  found  a  new  place  in 
another asset of the same company, in 14 Kazinczy Street (Somlyódy 2007). The 
advantage of using  a privately-owned  site  is the  high  level  of  autonomy  and 
immunity  to  political  changes. The  disadvantage  is that  only a commercially 
successful organization can pay the high rental prices in the district, but Szimpla 
has no problem in this respect. 
6.7 Impact  
Ruin pubs multiplied in less than a year after the establishment of the first open-
air Szimpla in 2002. The managers of Szimpla organized free courses on how to 
run such bars  (Somlyódy  2007).  Since  then, Szimpla  became  a  role  model  for 
similarly oriented cultural and hospitality innovators. With a few other pioneers, 
they established a phenomenon which is known now as ruin bars. The district, in 
addition  to  the  label “Jewish  District,” developed  a new  identity  as  a  “ruin  bar 
district” or “party district.” Ruin bars contributed to the “creative” atmosphere and 
increased the number of hospitality venues (Smith at all, 2018, 535). However, 
the phenomenon also contributed to the emergence of many problems, which were 
discussed above. 
Szimpla did not only establish a model for how to design a ruin bar but set up the 
standards also for   hospitality   service. Started   by   amateurs,   Szimpla 
professionalized  the ruin  pub  industry.  Now  there  is  a  team  of  experts  in 
marketing, public relations, information technologies, project management, and, 
of course, the hospitality industry. The quality of services is paramount. Szimpla 
also tries to change its environment, and they are a socially responsible enterprise.

Their position is that hospitality services have a responsibility for 
their clients and their behavior in public spaces:  
We have big plans for the district. We want to create an alliance with the other bars. 
We  want  to make the neighborhood  more livable,  more  attractive <...> We  care 
about the experience of other customers. We have many guests; we can afford not 
to keep profit in mind when we turn off the guests. We are lucky because people 
are listening to us; we are a role model for many. (Molnár 2019a) 
7 The model  
Ruin bars, among those Szimpla, emerged at the turn of the twentieth century in 
the courtyards of dilapidated empty buildings signed for demolition. The founders 
of the ruin bars took advantage of the dilapidated housing stock and with minimal 
investment, turned them into successful hospitality enterprises. They turned the 
dilapidated character into an aesthetic feature and economic asset.  
Ruin  bars  appeared  and  flourished  in  a  special  environment characterized by 
multiple conflicting interests of stakeholders, such as developers, the central and 
local  government,  heritage  protectionists,  and  the  residents. The  laissez-faire 
approach of the government and a deadlock in the urban development created a 
moment of opportunities for bottom-up initiatives which were able to adapt quickly 
to the changing environment. It was fueled by the public desire for non-conformist, 
non-conceptual spaces where culture and entertainment can be combined. 
The main characteristic features of ruin pubs are (based on Lugosi et al. 2010): 
- Entrepreneurial and opportunistic character 
- They relied on personal investment, networks, financing. 
- They were temporary and flexible in their manifestation and space (but 
professionalized later). 
- Importance of adaptive reuse of heritage, space, and objects. The reuse 
of unusual premises and objects adds to the novelty and creativity. 
- A strong relationship and organic cooperation between the commercial 
element and cultural character 
Ruin   pubs   re-appropriated   and   repurposed   disused   urban   buildings.   The 
spontaneous  reuse  fits  the  western  European  urban  trends,  but  it  is unique 
because it took place in the historical city center of the capital, in urban dwelling 
houses. 
The success of ruin pubs had its disadvantages. It catalyzed gentrification in the 
district, lead to the mushrooming short-term hospitality services, overtourism, and 
overcommercialization of the district. It increased the gap between the old cultural 
traditions (e.g., Jewish heritage) and the modern use (global entertainment).  
The  bottom-up  hospitality  process  has  been  developing  organically,  but  its  own 
success can be deadly. Thirsty for authenticity, the flocks of tourists impact the 
environment,  globalize  and  kill  its  character (or  turn  it  into  a quasi-authentic 
experience). Bottom-up  grassroots  initiatives with  a  social,  community,  and

cultural  mission, such  as Szimpla  can  be  engines  of  urban 
development  even  without  governmental support. However,  now, the  local 
government should  take a more  active  position  in  securing an economic  and 
socially sustainable development in which heritage protection and reuse  are the 
crucial elements. 
The  Szimpla  case  demonstrates  that hospitality  organizations  can  be  financially 
sustainable even if they do not focus on profit as their strategic goal but rather on 
public   good   and   social   entrepreneurship. Socially   responsible   hospitality 
enterprises pursuing ethical business can build an economically sustainable model 
and contribute to a better environment.

Executive summary 
LaFábrika detodalavida (The Factory of a Lifetime) is a participatory cultural 
space located in an abandoned cement factory in a small municipality in 
Extremadura, a rural region of western Spain. It is a place of experimentation 
with various economic, social and cultural processes that strive for inclusive self-
management in the region and expanded culture and opportunities in a rural 
context. LaFábrika detodalavida uses the commons, cooperative production, free 
culture and DIY construction to develop creative dynamics and methodologies. 
The heritage site is the host to projects and programmes such as Cine al Fresco, 
Pecha Kucha, Territorio Komún and Fábrika Komún as well as other entities such 
as La Fundación Maimona.

1. The Extremaduran Context 
Extremadura, Spain, located in the west of the country and formed by two of the 
largest provinces in Spain, Badajoz and Cáceres, covers about 8% of Spain’s total 
area.  It  is  the  connecting  ground  between  the  two  capital  cities  of  the  Iberian 
peninsula, Madrid and Lisbon, and its location on the border of Portugal gives the 
region the flavour of both Portuguese and Spanish cultures. Spanning roughly 4.2 
million square kilometers and containing slightly more than one million inhabitants, 
it has the lowest population density in the country (25.75 inhabitants/km
2
) and 
the lowest housing prices per square-meter in Spain.  
Extremadura  has  a  wealth  of  cultural  heritage  sites,  with  three  UNESCO  World 
Heritage sites in the cities of Cáceres, Mérida and Guadalupe, known as the “World 
Heritage  Triangle”,  along  with  many  other  preserved  sites  and  museums  from 
Roman,  Medieval  and  Renaissance  times.    It  is  also  popular  for  its  regional 
gastronomy, with its own designation of origin. Known for traditional Spanish cured 
ham  (jamón),  olive  oil,  cheeses  and  local  wines,  it  traces  the  influences  of  the 
Arab,  Jewish  and Roman inhabitants of the past and reflects a long tradition of 
blending ancestral customs and cultural heritage with forward-looking innovation. 
Despite the wealth of cultural history and natural resources, Extremadura has been 
one  of  the  poorest  regions of  Spain  economically.  After  the  Spanish  Civil  War, 
economic  policies  such  as  the  Badajoz  Plan  were  put  into  place  to  try  to 
industrialise  and  modernise  the  region.  The  cement  factory  and  subsequent 
economic activity and employment around it were part of this endeavour, but when 
the plan ended it left little lasting effect on the area. The region became once again 
a region depleted by emigration, losing almost a quarter of the population between 
1960 and 1980
1
, mostly to more prosperous regions of Spain in search of work or 
education. This trend continues to the present day. 
Extremadura as a region was not spared by the 2008 economic crisis that shook 
Spain  along  with  much  of  Europe,  and  although  Spain  is  said  to  have  made  a 
remarkable  “recovery”, Extremadura  still  has  one  of  the  highest  unemployment 
rates  and  lowest  activity  rates
2
,  leaving  it  far  behind  the  rest  of  the  country 
economically speaking.  
According  to  the  European  Commission,  “unemployment  is  one  of  the  biggest 
challenges faced by Extremadura. In 2017 the rate was 26.3% (129,900 people), 
being youth and women the most affected segments of the population. This figure 
is way above the national and EU average of 17.2% and 7.6%, respectively. At 
the beginning of 2017 the prospects continued the negative trend, almost reaching 
an unemployment rate of 30%, but data has shown some improvements in this 
regard, going back to proportions similar to those registered in 2016 (Eurostat, 
2018).”

Nevertheless, Extremadura’s natural beauty and cultural heritage may prove to be 
the region’s ticket out of economic depression and unemployment. Innovative and 
collaborative projects such as LaFábrika detodalavida are already making use of 
forgotten  or  overlooked  heritage  sites  to  breathe  new  life  into  local culture  and 
generate new and beneficial economies around the commons, DIY construction,

collaboration and the arts. As research, development and innovation have been 
cited
5
 as areas in which Extremadura is particularly lagging behind the rest of the 
country, these kinds of community projects may be just what the region has been 
needing to create sustainable opportunities for growth, livelihood and community 
and thereby creating the cultural gravity needed to keep its youth from moving 
away and to attract new energy, ideas and activity into the area. 
2. The story of the building and its heritage 
As  mentioned  above,  in  1952  the  Badajoz  Plan  was  approved  by  Franco’s 
government  in  order  to  modernise  and  industrialise  the  Badajoz  area  of 
Extremadura, giving special attention to large projects such as the construction of 
reservoirs,  dams,  villages  and  road  networks.  For  all  of  these  projects  to  be 
possible, a local source of cement was needed, and that is how the cement factory 
came to be. 
 
Picture 1: Alejandro Hernández Renner 
“There was a direct order coming from Madrid and there was no great debate 
that you should respect it as a law. You can imagine, in an area where we only 
had olive trees, pigs walking around, no line bringing electricity at the level that 
the factory needed –  everything had to be done, produced here, even the 
electricity was produced here with a generation system based on coal. So, this 
was the reality of how this space was created 50 years ago.” Alejandro 
Hernández Renner 
The cement factory completely changed the economic landscape in the town of Los 
Santos  de  Maimona.  The  rural  village,  which  had  previously  only  engaged  in 
agriculture, was chosen for its location near two major roads and a rail line, as well 
as for the quality of limestone in the nearby Sierra de San Cristóbal. With experts 
and professionals brought in from other parts of Spain to construct the facility, the 
population of Los Santos de Maimona experienced rare growth. Construction was

Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
LaFábrika detodalavida

completed in 1955, and in the following year the Asland Cement Factory opened 
its  doors.  The  village  benefited  directly  from  the  increase  in  employment 
opportunities, with around 300 families supporting themselves from local cement 
production. The factory was a success and after only a few years in operation, it 
expanded its facilities, constructing the tower that would come to be a symbol of 
the town’s industrial dreams.  
“Extremadura is a very rural area, in general terms. This was one of the very, 
very few industries that was set up in the region – big industries. And this was a 
very important place, in this sense. There were thousands of people depending 
on this activity. When it stopped, thousands of people left, and left for good. 
They never came back. We are talking about a region where six thousand people 
left. It's like the effect of a war.” Alejandro Hernández Renner 
The  unfortunate  end  of  the  Badajoz  Plan  came  in  1972.  With  the  large  scale 
construction  projects  complete,  there  was  no  longer  a  local  market  for  mass 
quantities of cement, and the Asland factory was forced to close its doors in 1973. 
The result was devastating for the local community, which in only 17 years had 
begun to thrive and prosper from its industrial dream. The factory remained empty 
and  unused,  lying  in  the  shadow  of  its  tower,  now  a  symbol  for  a  faded,  failed 
dream.  
“We don’t want to emigrate. We want to continue to enjoy this wealth, which is a 
right of our town.” Asland factory worker, Hoy newspaper, 19 April 1972 
Asland sold the factory and quarries to the town council of Los Santos de Maimona 
for  a  symbolic  amount  of  1  peseta  with  the  pretense  that  they  would  soon 
recommence operations at the site, thereby shirking any duty or responsibility to 
dismantle the facilities or clean up after themselves. In reality Asland already had 
plans to modernise other factories with much larger capacities for production. They 
took advantage of the town’s desperate state and left behind a patch of industrial 
wasteland. This site remained abandoned for the next 40 years, with the exception 
of one business that used it in the 80s to install and make use of a cement mixer.

los-santos-de-maimona.html 
The heritage of this particular factory entails a mixture of different emotions for 
older local residents. On the one hand there are memories of “the good times” that 
the factory brought and the pride in having contributed to some of Spain’s most 
important works of infrastructure.  
“We are talking about an industrial site created, from Madrid, serving a bigger 
project which was creating a whole structure of agricultural land in the whole 
region. Thousands of hectares are now being watered with the installations that 
were initially built with cement coming from this factory.”  Alejandro Hernández 
Renner 
On the other hand, the abandoned factory, largely in ruins, represents the false 
promises of industry made by distant officials who knew little about the lives and 
needs of the local population. It stands as a symbol of loss, not only of livelihood 
and  dreams  of  modernity,  but  also  of  a  significant  portion  of the  population, 
nowadays encompassing the continued loss of the town’s youth. 
“It has always had a very controversial history because it was only active for 17 
years, so for the population itself, it was a dream of industry in a rural world that 
was not used to population growth, that was not used to having work, that was 
made up of peasants.” Siro Santos 
Nevertheless, the youth of Los Santos de Maimona, now with a population of just 
over 8,000, have taken inspiration from the factory site. There is an interest in 
approaching the space through the lens of industrial archaeology – protecting the 
ruins, preserving the state of the site, while using DIY construction to repurpose 
the  space  and  give  it  new  life.  Some  young  people  who  had  left  Los  Santos  de

Maimona have come back to be a part of something new and to work with the raw 
potential of this post-industrial space.  
“It had been a private place, that means closed to the public for 25 years and 
well, it evolved into a ruin. So, the idea was, let's turn it into a space where 
companies, innovative companies, can do things. [....] It was an element of 
modernity in the 50’s and it should for all of us be again an element of modernity 
in the 21st century.” Alejandro Hernández Renner

3. The initiative (objectives, activities and 
values) 
 
The  initiative  of  LaFábrika  detodalavida began  at  the  end  of  2009  with  a  small 
collective of people interested in creating something out of the abandoned factory 
space. The factory had suffered neglect and vandalism and was in a complete state 
of disrepair. The original idea was to draw a connection between public intervention 
and the restoration of the space, though with a focus on political, public art. They 
wanted to turn the cement factory into a factory for social management and leisure 
in a rural environment and to use it as a starting point for creating an open network 
of creators, thinkers and social agents throughout the territory.  
The Los Santos de Maimona ceded the now public site to the collective in a kind of 
urban  masovería  (use  of  land  in  exchange  for  its  cultivation  or  maintenance) 
arrangement, whereby  the  collective  is  guaranteed long-term  use  of  the  site  in 
exchange for renovating the space. Over the years different constellations of about 
4-5  individuals  kept  the  collective  and  the  project  alive  until  about  2017,  when 
between 20 and 25 people became regularly involved.

“Those of us who intervened were professionalising our practice a little and we 
were also collaborating with outside projects. And from 2017 until now, a new 
and much broader community is intervening, tangibly much closer to the village, 
with actors and citizens from the local population, especially young people.” Siro 
Santos 
In  reclaiming  the  old  factory  space,  one  thing  was  very  important  for  those 
involved:  to  use  this  as  an  opportunity  to rewrite  a  history  of industrial  failure. 
There was an impetus to take inspiration from cases in northern Europe and rethink 
what  modern,  industrial  and  productive  sector  spaces  look  like.  What  could  be 
done to make this previously flourishing and relevant factory not only once again 
productive  and  relevant,  but also liveable.  The  idea  arose  of  creating  open and 
shared green and leisure spaces to provide the setting and inspiration for creative, 
innovative,  collaborative  and  political  productive  work.  By  bringing life  into  this 
space, the activists from LaFábrika detodalavida wanted to revive and explore a 
forgotten heritage and then convert and socialise that heritage into an open space 
where the community could connect, learn and share. 
“We’re changing the associations with the memory of the factory. We’re changing 
the historical associations that my grandmother has and that I have when we 
think about the factory.” Siro Santos 
4. Objectives 
The objectives of LaFábrika detodalavida are manifold, and this speaks to the 
openness of the collective to what the community wants and how it decides to 
use the space. In this vein, the collective aims to:  
● promote the cooperative production of commons  
● bring this cultural and meeting space into the daily lives of the community 
● create proposals and initiatives based on public feedback 
● promote reflection on how culture is constructed 
● create a space that is multicultural, intercultural and open to other 
cultures 
● strengthen the image of Los Santos de Maimona 
● facilitate and support tools for analysing and understanding Extremaduran 
society 
● create concrete programmes for community participation 
● establish a public space that is dedicated to its surroundings 
● mediate around controversial local issues 
● create social and cultural dialogue nationally and internationally from 
Extremadura 
● support free culture as a value and practice

5. Values 
Though the key players have changed to some degree since back in 2009, the core 
values of LaFábrika detodalavida have remained relatively consistent and well in 
line with the objectives of the project. In the agreement signed between LaFábrika 
detodalavida and the town council of Los Santos de Maimona, the three core values 
cited are: 
1. The promotion of free culture 
2. The encouragement of culture created in the countryside such as in 
villages or towns 
3. Contribution to the commons 
Siro Santos, one of the founding members of the collective, explains his take on 
the  project’s  values.  First,  he  mentions  the  ethic  of  DIY  construction,  reuse  of 
materials and zero cost as an act of empowerment and making dreams a reality, 
the idea of empowerment being particularly important for the community in terms 
of their connection to and attitudes around the local heritage of the factory.  
“...our position is to keep reusing material and standing in defense of the 
heritage site with very concrete and visible interventions to continue recovering 
materials.” Siro Santos 
Second, there is the value of taking typically urban practices and bringing them to 
the  countryside.  Specifically,  this  refers  to ideas about  the  commons, imagining 
futures, sharing knowledge, working with collective intelligence, etc. These ideals 
are generally developed and given attention in urban centres, though they could 
be just as helpful and relevant to rural communities. LaFábrika detodalavida works 
to give rural space to these urban practices.  
Finally,  the  third  key  value  is  simply  community  and  giving  attention  and  care 
towards how to build and practice community in rural contexts. Collaborator and 
activist Elena Galleiro echoes this sentiment as well.

“While we (at LaFabrika) follow certain values, which for me are care work, social 
transformation, integration, inclusion, the reality is that we’re in a world where 
these values are exactly what is missing. Instead, we’re (as a society) 
regressing, we’re completely focussing on our differences, on closing ourselves 
off. We’re more and more neoliberal. We work more and more under policies that 
are destructive for the environment and life in general. We meet this resistance 
every day and even in a context like this. I mean, you can make very theoretical 
contributions, but at the end of the day, the practice is your jumping off point for 
trying to convince other people. Philosophising is great. It’s great and we can 
leave it to academia, but here we focus on daily practices.” Elena Galleiro 
6. Activities 
LaFábrika detodalavida is home to a network of various organisations, projects, 
initiatives and individuals joined together by their shared passion for the space and 
dedication to slowly moulding it into the kind of creative cultural space that the 
region so desperately needs. While not having total carte blanche from the town 
council over what happens to the old factory site, the activist collective is often left 
to their own devices in terms of how to proceed with ideas, allowing them to plan 
independently  and  with  minimal  support.  Instead  of  feeling  discouraged  by  the 
lack of consistent local administrative engagement, though, the collective simply 
dives further into their DIY ethic.  
“Since we don’t hold the power of making a decision over what this [space] could 
be – even though we do have many ideas – we have presented projects and 
developed or tried to develop these ideas with the public administration in many 
negotiations. But our ideas have never been heard or even minimally supported, 
so we keep doing things in our own way, which means learning as we go and 
learning as we build.” Siro Santos

The collective’s persistence has paid off. Beyond local actions organised to reclaim 
the public factory space by clearing out previously inaccessible areas and creating 
parks  and  renovating  the  façade  of  some  of  the  factory  buildings,  people  have 
been coming to LaFábrika detodalavida from all over the country and the world to 
teach, explore and even set up businesses. 
“Mostly, people who belong to this project through this process are people who 
are very related to what we would call ‘knowledge economy’, intensive in 
technology, intensive in training. It's well-educated people. And this is the thing, 
that they mainly share. They do training or they do mentoring, or they organize 
an event where they can really share what they do and know professionally, with 
people that can profit from this knowledge.” Alejandro Hernández Renner 
Alejandro  Hernández  Renner  has  been  serving  as  director  at  La  Fundación 
Maimona  (The  Maimona  Foundation),  an  NGO  founded  by  Diego  Hidalgo  and 
dedicated  to  local  development  through  entrepreneurship  and  innovation.  This 
foundation is one of the organisations that has made LaFábrika detodalavida its 
home, and Renner is working to grow the innovative community and use the space 
to its fullest potential. 
“I have been facilitating the constitution of a community of SMEs, NGOs, public 
administrations and individual people which are interested in the rehabilitation 
and adaptation of the abandoned industrial site of the old cement factory in Los 
Santos de Maimona, Extremadura, Spain. Which projects illustrate this? The 
most visible outcome are the new buildings, the new infrastructures, and The 
Social Lab.

” Alejandro Hernández Renner 
In addition, regular programming at LaFábrika detodalavida has included:  
● Los Sábados detodalavida (Saturdays of a lifetime): open house days of 
lectures, workshops and leisure in a convivial, community atmosphere. 
● Fábrika Komún (Communal factory): programmes and processes based on 
Collaborative Social Management and Communal Social Action and centred 
around the needs of the local community and online solutions. 
● Cine al fresco: open air audiovisual and staged art during the summer 
months: shorts, documentaries, films and plays. 
● PechaKucha: a special kind of event for presenting ideas in a 20-second, 
20-slide format. 
● Territorio Komún (Common territory): a space of open participation for 
collaborating on creative, social and cultural content. LaFábrika 
detodalavida assists in managing, organising and producing related 
activities within the factory space.  
“For me the most important thing now is to begin to systematise all of the 
information that we are starting to generate. [...] We’re going to experiment. 
We’re going to be the laboratory where we mix together everything that has 
influenced us.” Elena Galleiro

7. Governance (regulations & policies) 
7.1. Relationship with the local government 
The  physical  space  of  the  old  Asland  factory  is  primarily  regulated  by  an 
agreement
6
,  signed  December  27,  2013,  between  the  collective  LaFábrika 
detodalavida and the Town Council of Los Santos de Maimona. The factory site is 
public  property,  but  the  agreement  between  these  two  parties  cedes  use  of  a 
portion  of  this  public  property  to  LaFábrika  detodalavida  in  exchange  for  the 
renovation of the space and the  subsequent  management  of  the  space  itself  as 
well as all  of  the activities  that  occur  within  it.  This  agreement  calls  for  mutual 
support between parties and references the Spanish government’s constitutional 
responsibility  to  promote  access  to  and  youth involvement  in  political,  social, 
economic and cultural development. 
The space ceded to the collective includes two main buildings of the factory and 
the covered outdoor space that joins them, totalling 473.86 square meters. Upon 
signing the agreement, the relevant factory spaces were deemed unsuitable and 
unsafe for occupancy, and the collective had to put in a considerable amount of 
work to bring the buildings up to code so that they could be frequented by locals 
and used for the greater social mission. 
LaFábrika detodalavida is not required to pay anything for the use of the space, so 
long  as  they  fulfill  their  commitment  to  renovation  in  accordance  with  all  legal 
requirements  and  necessary  permits.  The  initial  agreement  was  valid  through 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
LaFábrika detodalavida 
15 
 
December 31, 2015 and continues to be renewed for periods of four years. Aside 
from  the  main  task  of  refurbishing  the  premises,  LaFábrika  detodalavida  is  also 
responsible  for  maintaining  the  heritage  site  in  good  condition,  promoting  local 
tourism, culture and economy, securing insurance for the buildings, managing the 
programming of the factory and creating an annual report for the town council.  
In exchange for this, the town council provides and covers the costs of water and 
electricity  services,  support  in  seeking  out assistance,  municipal  brick  layers, 
electricians  and  plumbers,  disposal  containers  and  regular  rubbish  collection 
services. LaFábrika detodalavida is also given access to public materials stored in 
one  of  the  factory  buildings,  as  well  as  materials  found  nearby  on  the  factory 
premises. 
As for the activities carried out by LaFábrika detodalavida in the factory, all ideas 
and methodologies generated within the space are not subject to any intellectual 
property  rights,  and  the  project  itself  is registered  under  Creative  Commons or 
Move Commons licenses.  
Finally, the agreement also calls for a monitoring committee, made up of members 
of both parties, to stay informed about the progress and needs of the parties and 
to address any relevant concerns in biannual meetings.  
7.2. Internal governance 
LaFábrika detodalavida  itself is a  non-profit  organisation.  It  forms a  part  of  the 
international    network    of    collectives    Arquitecturas    Colectivas    (Collective 
Architectures). The collective also collaborates with the work group Mainova Social 
Lab and Centro Diego Hidalgo de empresas e innovación (Diego Hidalgo centre of 
enterprises  and  innovation),    all  operating  out  of  and  equally  committed  to 
developing  the  reclaimed  factory  space.  These  entities  operate  independently, 
though under the same social principles and ideals, and the latter two are funded 
by the Fundación Maimona (Maimona Foundation), which also has an office at the 
factory.  
Thus,  taking  into  account  the  local  government,  various  entities  and  the 
townspeople, there are many different groups with an interest in the success of 
the reclaimed factory space, a space which has a special significance in the mind 
and collective memory of the community: 
“We have a community of neighbours, so we’re not just the public 
administration, the foundation and LaFábrika detodalavida and the abandoned 
space of the cement factory, which – to me and to LaFábrika – has its own 
identity that does not go through the administration or the foundation or 
LaFábrika, but rather has its own identity.” Siro Santos  
Given  the  variety  of  stakeholders  involved  at  different  levels  and  to  different 
degrees,  as  well  as  the  mission  to  include  any  interested  community  member, 
LaFábrika has chosen to organise itself rather horizontally, focusing governance 
on individual  projects  and  work  groups  that  are  tied  together  under  a  common 
mission. This governance is based on micro-agreements (microconvenios) that are 
created by and apply to a particular group of individuals or entities working on a 
specific   project   together.   Micro-agreements   facilitate   the   organisation   and 

H2020 PROJECT

Deliverable 2.2 
LaFábrika detodalavida

management of these projects, establishing members’ capacity, time allotment, 
commitment and responsibilities. Micro-agreements  can  be  established  between 
any individuals or entities that want to be located in or make use of the factory 
building.  
Beyond this, there are also work groups for issues such as economic sustainability. 
These groups evolve and change over time and name representatives who take on 
the responsibility of the work group’s function. Work groups display a certain level 
of independence in that they are responsible for their own actions and the direction 
that the work group takes is in the hands of its members, but there are periodic 
assemblies to transparently and horizontally make decisions that affect the whole 
collective. LaFábrika detodalavida’s open and dynamic form of internal governance 
is based on the idea of (disorganised) society
7
.  
 
8. Challenges 
Despite  a  successful  start  in  transforming  this  once  forgotten  space  into  an 
important  centre  of  culture,  creativity  and  ideas  for  a  community  with  few 
resources, there are still a number of challenges that LaFábrika detodalavida faces 
in terms of governance and regulations. The biggest challenge is probably the lack 
of serious engagement and imagination on the part of the town council.  
For instance, in 2013 when the town council brought in electric and water services 
to  enable work  to  begin  on  the  space, they  were  focused only  on  the  technical, 
physical  process  of  renovation  without giving  consideration  to  important  details 
such as the question and significance of preserving local heritage or the condition 
of the “public” areas of the factory. 
Disorganised society - refers to organising around specific goals, 
disorganising and deconstructing and then re-organising around further, newer 
goals, the collective creates myriad ways of relating to one another and 
working together, both broadening the spectrum of experience for all those 
involved but also forming a system based on social equality and closeness. 
This results in the distribution of power and knowledge and supports the 
mutual support and well-being of the collective as a whole.

“More thought was given to opportunities stemming from new constructions than 
from defending the heritage, playing with softer structures — softer 
interventions, recovery of spaces, cleaning, giving a little attention to the amount 
of danger that the cement factory still poses. There is a lot of access to spaces in 
the cement factory that still aren’t fenced in, and I think it’s the responsibility of 
the public [administration] to deal with that. Any person, any child can just climb 
up a seven-story tower because it’s not closed off.” Siro Santos 
The town council has also proven to be rather hands-off in terms of continuing to 
collaborate with LaFábrika detodalavida over the years.  
“For four years, since right when we signed the agreement, we have never even 
minimally been invited to find out anything about governance and what future 
the space that we meet in holds.” Siro Santos 
LaFábrika  detodalavida  has  persisted  in  their  dedication  to  making  the  space 
operable  and  implementing  year  after  year of  actions,  events,  exchanges  and 
cultural  activity  to  engage  the  local  community  and  bring  in  outside  talent  and 
expertise. Many concrete proposals to expand the work of LaFábrika detodalavida 
have  been  made  to  the  town  council,  but  they  have  generally  not been  agreed 
upon and have resulted in stalemates.  
Aside from a lack of shared vision with the town council, there is also some degree 
of  unity  missing  among  the  various  groups  using  the  factory  space.  LaFábrika 
detodalavida have always maintained transparency as an important value in terms 
of  their  own governance  but have  not  found  that  to  be  the  case  with  all  of  the 
groups sharing the factory space.  
“Governance among the entities, collectives, citizens that frequent and occupy 
the cement factory has always been pretty unclear, so to speak. On the one

Grant Agreement No 776766

hand, from our side, we did an exercise, the little exercise of transparency that 
we could do, to have our agreement free, open and downloadable on our 
webpage so that everyone could know the rules that we have and that we have 
negotiated with the public administration.” Siro Santos 
Alejandro  Hernández  Renner  echoes  the  sentiment  that  shared  values  are  not 
enough – shared and open governance must also drive this project and be a point 
of engagement for everyone involved: 
“I think that an integrated approach is necessary, a clear governance and 
strategic open structure with [the] participation of all stakeholders and 
shareholders, a dynamic emergent planning process which does not exclude 
future alternatives, openness to global and local trends and circumstances, 
maintenance of symbolic elements, harmony with nature and surroundings, and 
connectivity.” Alejandro Hernández Renner 
9. The economic model 
“[In the past] the town council used public money to restore certain sections of 
the cement factory, but it never intervened with public money here. LaFábrika 
continues to be completely self-run.” Siro Santos 
As mentioned above, LaFábrika detodalavida receives basic services and some raw 
materials from the town council, but aside from these provisions, the project is 
entirely self-funded. In 2013, the collective launched a crowdfunding campaign on 
the Goteo
8
 platform for phase one of the project, restoring the “technical office”. 
The campaign aimed to raise a minimum of 4,500 euros and exceeded this goal, 
bringing  in  a  total  of  6,000  euros  from  92  different  contributors.  LaFábrika 
detodalavida has also received smaller amounts of money from grants and awards, 
but in general they have managed to accomplish an impressive amount with a very 
limited budget and a lot of self-determination.  
 
This in itself has been a part of the collective’s economic policy. The reliance on 
DIY construction and sourcing of recycled materials is not an alternative option in 
the  face  of  scarcity,  but  rather  a  consciously  chosen  strategy  to  show  that  it  is 
possible to effectively, safely and collaboratively carry out construction in different 
ways that actually educate, engage and build community.  
With  this  approach  the  collective  wants  to  show  that  social  capital  is  just  as 
important as economic capital. All of the contributions of knowledge, labour and 
time  spent  collaborating  and  problem  solving  to  renovate  the  factory  space 
together  end  up  yielding  usable  resources.  In  this  way,  the  social  capital  of 
intangible relationships is converted into tangible resources. 
crowdfunding  - the means of finding funding for a project by raising 
money from a large number of people whether it be in large or small 
amounts, more often than not through the Internet. Crowdfunding is a 
type of crowdsourcing and alternative means for finance.  

H2020 PROJECT

Deliverable 2.2 
LaFábrika detodalavida

LaFábrika  detodalavide,  however,  does  not  ignore  the  fact  that  monetary  funds 
are  also  necessary  to  take  things  to  the  next  level  and  create  opportunities  to 
continue building the social capital of the project as well. The collective lists P2P 
loans,  ethical  banking,  microloans,  European  and  national  funds  as  possible 
approaches to funding moving forward. In fact, most of the other organisations in 
the factory space have counted on many of these types of funding, including the 
INTERREG  programme  and  the  Fundación  Maimona,  adding  to  the  diversity  of 
experiences under the factory roof. 
“LaFábrika detodalavida did its own self-building, recycling and renewal process at 
a very, very low costwith crowdfunding and the help of a lot of people from the 
whole  country.  Those  processes  were  happening  at  the  same  time.  I  had  visits 
from colleagues from architecture colleges, that were very interested in seeing all 
this happening at the time. Now, if you have a look at the space it's got a feeling 
of  patchwork  because  the  result  of  this  is  necessarily  different,  and  all  these 
realities coexist in a very harmonious way. You can see the traces of those different 
management approaches. This floor is clearly one approach, this building on the 
left is a very organic and handmade approach, and ours is much more techie and 
oriented to companies which have a different profile. And all this is around us, it's 
interesting.”  Alejandro Hernández Renner

10. Community engagement 
Community   engagement   has   been   central   to   the   mission   of   LaFábrika 
detodalavida. It is the absence of opportunities to engage, teach and learn from 
the community that has driven so many young people to seek out broader horizons 
in big cities around Spain, leaving their home town behind. LaFábrika detodalavida 
has  been  conceived  of  as a  way  to  bring new  life  and  new ideas into  this  rural 
community and give it stronger connections to the outside world. As these efforts 
have mostly been led by younger people, there has naturally been some reluctance 
and  scepticism  on  the  part  of  the  older  generations  of  the  town,  but  LaFábrika 
detodalavida maintains that the involvement of this older part of the community 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
LaFábrika detodalavida 
20 
 
is  essential  to  the  success  of  the  project  and  that  these  relationships  must  be 
handled with care and patience.  
“In the big cities it’s easy to find yourself more in circles where you can spend all 
day feeding off of the fact that everyone thinks the same, but here you leave 
your comfort zone as soon as you step out of your front door ... because this is 
also your closest community and it hurts much more when the criticism comes 
from those close to you. But it’s another challenge and another way of beginning 
to transform things locally, in order to later advance bit by bit.” Elena Galleiro 
Events such as Heritage Days are opportunities to dialogue with the community 
and  learn  about  the  needs  of  the  neighbours,  the  foundation,  LaFábrika 
detodalavida collective, the factory space itself as well as the town administration. 
LaFábrika  detodalavida  firmly  believes  that  these  types  of  processes  must  be 
transparent  in  order  to  start  to  build  trust  between  the  community  and  those 
managing the factory space that has hurt the town before.  
“It’s a very necessary moment to exercise transparency, to get to know what 
everyone thinks and to start to look for common solutions. Not only this idea of 
direct action, not only the idea that “they should keep giving to me”, not only the 
idea of making demands, but rather sitting together around a work table with 
trust and, I think, also with a sense of responsibility. Because in the end the 
foundation has its responsibilities and works in one way, LaFábrika in another 
way and the neighbours in yet another way, and I think the thing that is held in 
common is that we do see a value in the heritage and in the cement factory 
itself.” Siro Santos 
Many people in the town have a personal connection to the Asland factory and its 
17 years of booming success. Their family and professional histories are tied to it. 
It put Los Santos de Maimona on the map, and therefore there is a vested interest 
in it as a site of local heritage. LaFábrika detodalavida wants to bring this location 
back to life and make it once again a central hub for the community, where people 
can feel that they belong and have agency. However, this time the factory should 
be more than just an employer who packs up and leaves when profits decrease. It 
should make up for the tainted past by addressing the concerns and needs of the 
local community and beyond. 
“It is also a great responsibility for this community to link to the worries and the 
expectations of the rest of the territory and increase its impact, its capacity of 
helping others to get a better life. Not only yours but also the life of all the other 
members of your community. So, we have been trying to open up again, to 
make people aware of the fact that this belongs to them. It belongs to us, it 
belongs to them. It belongs to all.”  Alejandro Hernández Renner 
Sharing and finding common purpose for this revived industrial space may not be 
so easy at first, but members of LaFábrika detodalavida are determined to take 
the time to find shared experiences and points of overlap with other members of 
the  community.  Different  topics  or  formats  of  discussion  introduced  by  the 
collective might seem very urban and imported, but that does not mean that they 
are not relevant to Los Santos de Maimona or that the community has nothing to 
offer in return. On the contrary, collaboration and shared ideas are the foundation 
of this project.

“If we’re having a discussion here about feminism, the first ones we have to talk 
with are probably the women’s association. Maybe they don’t share the practices 
that we consider important, but if we believe that we really empower others and 
that we are all leaders of the processes we carry out, then we have to involve 
everyone in this area and on the other side of the factory wall and begin to 
coordinate – not only to facilitate the spaces, but because it’s part of our 
identity: My name is Elena. I’m from Los Santos de Maimona. I’m a woman. I 
was a migrant for many years, and all of these things intersect in me. Who else 
shares these intersections? What other identities do we have as we approach this 
process which is still being created? There is no script and that makes it 
dynamic, alive. It’s a living entity, it’s an organism. How amazing that it will 
continue evolving just as it has evolved up to this point.” Elena Galleiro 
In  fact,  this  strategy  does  bring  people  together.  Members  of  these  various 
communities enter into discussion with each other and slowly networks begin to 
emerge.  People  find  out  that  they  share  certain  concerns  or  ideas  of  how  to 
improve life in the town. From this space they can begin to exchange ideas and 
formulate  goals  and  ultimately  work  together  to  create  solutions  that  benefit 
everyone. This is the work that LaFábrika detodalavida wants to see not only under 
its own roof but also spreading out into the world via these networks.  
“When there is a talk here and 50 people come, it also opens up the margins of 
the community and new possibilities arise for the concept to be replicated, free, 
open, for it to [...] reach a completely different community and have the 
opportunity to mix and be integrated directly in a laboratory of practice that is 
collaborative, shared and open just like LaFábrika itself.” Siro Santos 
And this is exactly what makes LaFábrika detodalavida relevant on an international 
level  despite  its  rural  and  isolated  physical  location.  This  is  what  attracts  new 
people to this space of possibility. The collective encourages people to come from 
outside, be inspired by what they see, share their insights and skills and give back 
to the local community, thereby further expanding the town’s network. This is the 
thinking behind the year-long residencies offered at LaFábrika detodalavida. 
“We offer people to stay here for a while once a year, we make an open call for a 
project, and we get them to be here with us for free – no cost for one year. The 
only thing we ask them in return is once a week, once a month, you have to give 
back to the community the way you think is best, but you have to do that. So 
that we can really connect to the worries and expectations of the members of the 
surrounding territory. And this kind of responsibility is also a key element that 
we have to work on in the future.” Alejandro Hernández Renner 
Most importantly, the new sense of community around LaFábrika detodalavida is 
what brings departed, young community members back home to share what they 
have  learned  out  in  the  world  and  learn  from  what  has  changed  back  home. 
Establishing  connections  worldwide  means that  returning  back  to Los  Santos de 
Maimona is not stepping back in time. The town is not irrelevant and in fact can 
offer more diversity of experience than ever before. 
“I think that we’ve been able to get many different experiences to come together 
here. This has a lot to do with the fact that many of us have always been away, 
but many of us have also always been here, and these experiences have made

us who we are, right? For example, there are many people from this area who 
have been active in other community centres – either self-managed, leased, 
occupied or self-employed – in many other places: Seville, Madrid, Barcelona. I 
think that this is all experience that we have assimilated and been able to pour 
into LaFábrika’s processes and community. Everything that we’ve managed to 
accumulate in terms of personal experience influences our networks today. Right 
now our networks reach both nationally and internationally, which means that 
anything done here can be carried over to many other spaces.” Elena Galleiro 
The process of community engagement involves the creation of a new, expanded 
community, which requires patience, listening, care and time. This is particularly 
the case for the factory site in Los Santos de Maimona, which still stands in the 
shadow of a past tainted by disappointment and injustice. LaFábrika detodalavida 
remains optimistic, though, and focuses on slowly building trust and relationships 
with community members one by one.  
“The failure of the cement factory has always had a negative connotation for the 
village, right? So, opening and socialising this negative history from the 
perspective of new opportunities for new resources and new public spaces... we 
don’t reach everyone and we know it, but the people that do come end up 
staying, and that’s important.” Siro Santos

“Abandoned spaces often generate images of the future, or rather, they make 
you imagine the future.” Siro Santos 
LaFábrika detodalavida has opened up the possibility of something new in an area 
that has not experienced any kind of cultural, economic or demographic growth in 
recent generations. This means the possibility of identifying what the community 
needs and brainstorming in a creative, collaborative and constructive way to bring 
about change.  
“We want to do something, we think about how to do it, we begin to do it. I think 
that the Fabrika’s biggest impact is this: we create the possibility to believe that 
there are ways to do new things.” Elena Galleiro 
This has a significant impact on how younger people from Los Santos de Maimona 
feel about their hometown. As cities become more crowded and less livable, some 
people  are  realising  that  there  is  possibility  and  opportunity  in  returning  to  the 
countryside, a stark contrast to the dominant narrative. 
“Now is the moment to return home, which is always seen as a failure. You 
always hear about the ‘return to the village’ or that ‘So and so returned to the 
village.’ It’s like a failure because we’ve always been told that there are no 
possibilities in the village, no networks, no future.” Elena Galleiro 
But Galleiro, who herself has returned to Los Santos de Maimona after many years 
away, has found the experience transformative. She has learned the importance 
of making changes locally before globally and that with the right networks, changes 
and actions in a small community can still be shared and transmitted on a large 
scale.  
“For me, having returned to the village after so much time, yes, to a large extent 
it means rethinking how to transform the most mundane and close things, from 
the communities that are closest to me through small, small changes and how 
that can eventually affect other realities.” Elena Galleiro 
This is an important message that LaFábrika detodalavida hopes to instill in the 
local youth as they begin to make decisions about their own futures. 
“For me it is fundamental to begin to transmit, especially to the young people 
from here in the village – well, normally most of them go to study away from 
here – but then they can return and change things from here. You don’t need to 
stay in the cities. You don’t need to go anywhere else. There are opportunities 
here. Believe in them and create them yourself. Create them and begin to 
change what you didn’t like before. Think about how you connect with your past, 
in order to create a future in and close to the community that will always be your 
roots and your history.” Elena Galleiro

1 Introduction  
Halele Carol represents one of the most well-known adaptive re-use projects in 
Bucharest. The former factory hall is located in a still-running industrial complex 
with an impressive history. The now - Hesper factory continues its activity in the 
oldest industrial area in Bucharest next to Carol Park, a former innovation area 
which drove the city’s economy at the end of 19
th
 century. Over time, the factory 
stopped using several of the old halls and moved to the more modern ones, built 
in the 20
th
 century. Halele Carol is a project that evolved organically, through the 
initiative of local cultural actors who wanted to show the potential of industrial 
heritage and of the area for Bucharest. Through temporary-use functions and small 
investments, the project opened the old halls gradually to the public through 
creative events, bringing the creative class of Bucharest towards the southern part 
of the city, which lacked the same attractiveness as the more-popular center. 
Nowadays, the main renter of Halele Carol is Expirat Club, one of the preferred 
leisure places in Bucharest for the young, alternative crowd. The story of Halele 
Carol is still to be developed, as new initiatives are needed to take the place to the 
next level.

3 Story of the building 
“The whole place was really great. It is separated from the park by a wall, but you 
can really feel the connection with the park. And I was amazed that this place was 
staying empty there. I really saw the potential of the site.” Meta van Drunen 
 
In 1869, the first train station of Romania was opened in Bucharest, on the Filaret 
hill. Following the train station, several factories and innovation institutes were 
relocated or constructed on the hill, transforming it into the most important 
innovation district in Bucharest. 
 
In 1887, the Wolff factory also relocated on the Filaret hill. The factory was already 
producing bandages since 1877 and it was owned by a swiss engineer, Erhardt 
Wolff. After the relocation, the factory expended the production activities to include

warfare machines, installations for steam locomotives and brass 
and bronze foundries. A few years later, in 1906, the Carol Park is opened on the 
hill adjacent to the factory – an impressive outdoor exhibition space built in the 
honour of King Carol’s 40
th
 year of reign. In 1921, the factory was directly 
connected to the railway station Filaret to provide equipment for the army.  
 
During the communist regime, the factory was nationalized and became state 
property. The name is changed to ‘Red Star’ (Steaua Rosie) and it started 
producing heavy machinery for the construction industry and hydraulic equipment.  
 
After the fall of the communist regime, the factory became a joint-stock company 
(societate pe actiuni), however with one majoritarian owner. In the present day, 
the factory still produces hydraulic pumps and engines under the name of Hesper 
S.A. It is one of the last active factories in Bucharest and definitely the last one in 
the area. However, the factory has had drastic personnel cuts and is struggling 
with the degrading condition of the buildings. 
 
“We were invited by Zeppelin to have a look at this space that is somewhere in the 
centre of Bucharest and it is standing empty for some years already. They were 
searching for some ideas how to renovate or how to revigorate this area. So we 
went there and we were absolutely impressed by the place and we immediately saw 
the potential of the rooms, of the big hall, of the smaller rooms underneath the 
hall...” Joep de Roo 
 
Picture 2. Google Earth Satellite view of current factory site. 
The building is a site with industrial heritage value, although not listed as a national 
monument. In 1921, the terrain had a surface of 15.000 m2. Several constructions 
can be currently found in the site, with different construction years as follows: 
 
• 1899 – various constructions. Only one is still standing, in the South side of 
the terrain, next to the Filaret Church (Biserica Cuţitul de Argint). 
• 1905 – The old factory buildings facing Carol Park 
• 1936 – Main hall and the power plant in the North Side 
• 1939-1943 – many small extensions. Many will be demolished in 1978 
• 1978 - multi-storey hall from reinforced concrete 
• End 1980 – a hall made of prefabricated reinforced concrete

The main hall is now used as a storage space for old machinery 
from the last century. The reinforced concrete building is still used by Hesper SA 
to produce hydraulic pumps. The initiators from Zeppelin and Eurodite opened the 
old factory building and Sala Compresoarelor for events in the period of 2014-
2016. Currently, Expirat Club functions in Sala Compresoarelor.

4 The initiative 
“The idea was that we would develop it step by step. As you can see, it is a big 
space, there are a lot of halls that need renovation, so it would need a big 
investment and there is... at the moment we didn’t and we still don’t have that 
amount of money to invest. So the idea was that we do a step by step renovation, 
trying to program it, having events here and then with the money that we’d earn 
through the events we could start renovating it. Through kind of an organic model. 
That was the model that we had in mind when we started in 2011.” Joep de Roo 
 
In 2001, Irina Iamandescu, a heritage expert working at the Ministry of Culture, 
started introducing the topic of industrial heritage in Bucharest. Before this, there 
was very little consideration for factories as heritage. She organised a workshop 
on industrial heritage and also started to get in touch with the owners of the 
various factories in the Filaret hill area.  
 
“When I wrote my diploma in ’97 on the Filaret Electrical Plant (another industrial 
site in the area), I was asked by the commission of architects: ‘where is this factory? 
Is this in Bucharest?’ So it was sort of like untouched territory.” Irina Iamandescu 
In 2011, the architecture magazine Zeppelin, together with Irina Iamandescu 
organised a guided tour to various industrial heritage sites in Bucharest. Almost 
200 people participated. It started a discussion about the possibilities to 
reintegrate these sites into the city life as cultural and creative centres.  
 
“I knew that there were funds, or a subsidy available in the Netherlands for the 
creative industries, and I started to make a project together with Constantin. About

how can we arrange a sort of knowledge exchange and share 
expertise, to improve the factory and to kickstart the process of transformation. In 
order to make the application, we also involved the Dutch embassy already.”  Meta 
van Drunen 
In 2013, the Creative Industries Fund NL in the Netherlands opened a call for 
stimulating knowledge exchange in the creative industries between Dutch experts 
and international sites. Eurodite and Zeppelin developed a project called “Creative 
Factories Bucharest” in 2013. The project obtained funds from the Creative 
Industries Fund NL to bring Dutch experts to Romania to showcase some best 
practices and examples of successful transformations of industrial heritage sites. 
Among them was Liesbeth Jansen, the former director of Westergasfabriek in 
Amsterdam, a famous example of industrial heritage re-use through temporary 
functions.  
 
 
In a two-day workshop, the owner, together with Romanian and Dutch experts, 
addressed several transformation scenarios. The team opted to transform the 
building using an organic transformation process and several temporary functions. 
This workshop was also a key moment in developing a relationship of trust between 
the initiators and the owner of the factory.

Trust turned out to be one of the main challenges for collaboration in the case of 
Halele Carol, so building trust became a focus of the adaptive re-use process. This 
was done through international cooperation and diplomacy, by involving the Dutch 
ambassador and accessing funds. Later on, also other funds were accessed via the 
Norwegian EEA grants and European cooperation funds. Moreover, the team of 
initiators involved at the beginning of the process had a hands-on approach, a 
Step by step renovation = to transform and upgrade the buildings gradually on 
the base of available capacity and funds at that moment. By organising events 
and subsidies, relatively small amounts of money are raised which can be 
invested into upgrading the buildings and surrounding spaces.

‘showing by doing’ way of dealing with the project and the 
stakeholders involved, resulting in transparency and trustworthiness.   
 
“The most important thing was to build the little trust that we built with them 
[factory owner and his team]. That was essential. They were very reluctant to our 
age, there is a 20 years difference. They grew up in a totally different culture. So, 
we wanted to create this bridge of communication and trust. This was the most 
important thing. This is my prospect, to create trust.” Constantin Goagea  
Later on, several small but vital fixes were done with the help of the engineers 
working at the factory, which changed the course of the project for the better. 
 
“There was a sort of breakthrough moment, [...] what we did, we made an excel 
list. Just really pointing out, ‘this roof here, the thing there’. They [factory 
employees] are all engineers! When they get an excel list, then they understand 
what to do. [...] They started repairing some urgent leakages, and at some point, 
they were trying to level the floor. [...] Because they were in [economic] crisis, and 
they had a little bit of a quiet period, they put people from the factory to do all these 
works.” Meta van Drunen 
In 2014, the factory opened to the public under the name of Halele Carol. The 
launch event attracted 2000 people. Several events were organised until 2015 
which established the location as a hotspot in the cultural scene in Bucharest.  
 
In 2015, a fire took place in another factory in the area which was used as a 
nightclub, which had a huge impact on Bucharest and Romania. Many bars and 
clubs were closed after this incident, and many event organisers started being 
more careful about safety regulations. The owner of the factory at Halele Carol 
decided to stop all activities on site following this incident. 
 
In this context, in 2016, Expirat, one of the oldest clubs in Bucharest, decided to 
look for a safer location and relocated to Halele Carol. Even though the initiators 
had bigger plans for the transformation of Halele Carol initially, it was still a victory 
that they managed to convince the owner to keep the factory open for culture as 
opposed to some more commercial options.

6 Activities 
Picture 6.  Post Industrial Design – exhibition at Halele Carol, photo by Vlad Bâscă 
Halele Carol offered a new platform for a wide community of artists and event 
organisers working with innovative concepts and formats in the city. Very quickly 
after the opening, Halele Carol became an important venue for event organisers 
and many were inquiring about renting the space or had several ideas for 
developing concepts on the location.  
 
Most of the events organised by Zeppelin were concerts, electronic music festivals, 
design and architecture exhibitions or debates, film nights but also workshops for 
children on architecture and heritage.  
The owners showed no interest in renting out the spaces and wanted to have a 
certain degree of control over the buildings, which made temporary events a good 
way of working for the first years.  
 
“The idea was that we would make a collaboration with the owner to start investing 
in this place through events... so that we would have a step by step funding model. 
And that this would lead to value creation over the long run. But it proved to be 
that this is very difficult to explain. That this kind of processes take a long time and 
that the cost comes before the benefit. And if you realize this or you have a long 
term view, what you invest now especially in this kind of big places, you will not get 
a return on investment within 1 or 2 years. It takes 10-15 years at least and then 
Organic transformation / step by step adaptive reuse. 
Overall,  the  concept  of  organic  transformation  means  that  small  foreseeable 
steps are taken in the transformation process (as opposite to a blueprint plan). 
It does not mean that there is no control or no plan. What it means is that the 
process and activities needed to reach the end objective are not defined in detail. 
The area is tested ‘live’ and the process is open to change. Implementation is 
incremental and through this type of transformation, risks are smaller and there 
is more flexibility in steering the process. Community involvement is often high 
because the plans are open and flexible, while ideas of the community can be 
taken on board during implementation.

your return on investment can be quite big. You have to have this 
timeframe to invest your money and efforts. And I think that this was very complex 
to explain to the Romanian owners. And also regarding the fact that they still have 
their own factory activities here, so that was the focus of their attention.” Joep de 
Roo 
 
The initiators managed to cover some of the operating costs from various funding 
sources, organising events or renting out the space for events. The event activity 
also brought some profit to Hesper S.A. However, the two parties did not manage 
to make a long term agreement on how to invest in the space and how to create 
a management model that is fair for all actors.  
 
7 Financial resources 
As mentioned above, one of the important revenue sources was organising events 
or renting out spaces to event organisers. Besides this, the initiators have set up 
two European collaboration projects to kick-start and give an impulse to the 
project. 
 
The first subsidized initiative was the Creative Factories, which received a grant of 
18.000 euro from the Creative Industries Fund NL in 2013. The grant was used to 
bring some experts in adaptive re-use of industrial heritage from the Netherlands 
and have a workshop together with the owner in order to analyse various business 
models for the long-term development of the factory. The initiators also organised 
a public debate on the transformation of industrial heritage and created three 
tandem articles that looked at 3 Dutch cases of adaptive re-use of industrial 
heritage and connected them to Romanian realities.  
 
The initiators regard this activity as the key point that enabled the process of the 
re-use project. Tapping into the rich Dutch experience on transformation of 
industrial heritage kick-started the project and provided a great base for a 
cooperation with the owner of the factory.  
Value creation and return on investment in organic transformation 
If  you  do  an  organic  transformation,  a  lot  of  time  (instead  of  a  large  sum  of 
money  in  one  go)  is  invested  in  testing  and  ‘branding’  the  space.  Organic 
transformation  activities  will  eventually  lead  to  a  suitable  programme  for  the 
area  and  subsequent  money  flows,  leading  eventually  to  enough  capital  to 
renovate the buildings. (see text box ‘Step by step renovation’).  
The ‘programming’, ‘branding’, and putting the location ‘on the mental map’ lead 
to  value  increase.  The ones  doing  this  (place-makers/community)  should  be 
compensated for the value they create. Ideally, they are ‘shareholders’. 
This is a complex matter that requires a good discussion between owners, place-
makers,  communities.  and  investors  on  the  concepts  of  ‘ownership’,  ‘time’, 
‘money’, and ‘risks’.

Secondly, in 2015, the initiators applied for EEA (also known as Norwegian) grants 
to organise cultural events and cultural education in the less developed south side 
of Bucharest, while improving the bad shape of iconic historic buildings and 
enhancing intercultural dialogue between Romania and Norway. Within this 
project, financed with 200.000 euro and led by Zeppelin, several artists and 
architects from Norway and Romania developed some installations and 
interventions at the Halele Carol site. The project contributed to important steps 
in the transformation process: attracting new audiences and activating and 
improving the public space on site with the art installations. Looking back, the 
initiators assessed the administration and reporting procedures as being very 
bureaucratic. 
 
“We found out that we spent more than 50% of our time in the administrative part. 
And what we did as an art project or for community involvement became 
unimportant compared to how much effort went into keeping up the administration.” 
Constantin Goagea

At this point, in 2019, the main economic activities taking place at the site are the 
production of hydraulic pumps in Hesper, and the Expirat club activity in Sala 
compresoarelor.  
 
EEA Grants / Norwegian funds 
The  EEA  grants  pose  nice  opportunities  for  funding  heritage  related  projects, 
particularly  in  south-eastern  European  countries.  Besides  the  appealing  EEA 
regulations,  additional  rules  of  the  local  programme  authorities  apply.  In  the 
case of Romania, the fund is managed by the Ministry of Culture. The ministry 
applied very tough reporting procedures focussing on processes and paperwork, 
and  not  so  much  on  content.  The  fact  that  the  lead  applicant  was  a  private 
organisation made the reporting process even more difficult.

8 Non-financial resources 
On the other hand, many non-monetary resources were used for the project, and 
they were equally important for ensuring the process could happen. These 
resources were: international expertise in adaptive re-use projects, expertise in 
writing funding/subsidy applications, having architects involved in the project, the 
Zeppelin magazine with its community and online presence, design and 
communication experience of the team members, experience with event 
organising, the access to property (and its lack of heritage status), a rooted 
network in Bucharest through the Zeppelin members, and perhaps most 
importantly, goodwill.    
 
 “[The Zeppelin platform was] indispensable. We couldn’t have done anything 
without it. It would have been impossible. Because if you want to have a temporary 
phase, then you need to be able to reach a crowd. Especially we, as foreigners, 
were not able to do that, so you need to actually work with locals. When we were 
writing the application for the Norwegian funds, Cosmina [Zeppelin] said ‘you have 
to build a community’. And that was quite an original (not yet in fashion) thing to 
say back then, but she was definitely very right. You have to really build a 
community from the start.” Joep de Roo 
 
Another important breakthrough moment was when the initiators made an excel 
list with small but important fixes which could enable the opening of the factory to 
the public. The spaces were not usable at the moment of arrival as the floor had 
several holes and there were some leakage issues. After creating the excel, the 
owner of the factory asked some workers in the factory to work on fixing the issues 
identified by the architects. This was a very important non-monetary resource as 
they managed to make a lot of progress in a short amount of time and with 
relatively low financial investments. This was only made possible because of the 
trust that was built. 
 
„A very important moment which meant a lot for the project was when we made an 
excel list with what could be done in a short amount of time. And the owner, who 
is an engineer, [...] when he looked at the list and understood that he could change 
some things and make the space usable for events, by using only own resources 
and very small financial investments, he rolled up his sleeves, called everyone in 
the factory, explained what everyone needed to do and said: ‚hereby we begin!’ ” 
Constantin Goagea. 
9 Branding and positioning  
Even though the initiative to transform Halele Carol through temporary 
programming only lasted for about two years, the initiators really managed to 
create a strong identity and brand of the venue. The name Halele Carol was set 
when developing the first application for funds. 
 
“And in that moment the name Halele Carol was born, and somehow everyone 
immediately accepted it as if it had always been the name of the place. But this is 
not really the historical truth. The place was called Wolff Factory, then the Red Star, 
now Hesper. Actually, Halele Carol is just this place at the back which is made of 
red bricks, bordering the park, it’s only this part. [Very soon after the opening], you

could ask a taxi driver to take you to Halele Carol and they would 
know immediately.” Constantin Goagea 
 
Having Zeppelin Association as the main institution associated with the site was 
also very beneficial for the branding and positioning. Zeppelin has been editing an 
architecture magazine with the same name since 2011and it was a well-known 
cultural organisation in the Bucharest scene at the moment of the project launch. 
Associated with high quality design and content, the association already had an 
important following which was slowly also becoming a community around the 
Halele Carol location.

10 Heritage 
The area in which Hesper S.A. is located has a rich industrial history, having been 
one of the first innovation areas in Bucharest. The factory represents the industrial 
pioneering spirit of the 19
th
 century. Therefore, the industrial innovation identity is 
a central theme in the adaptive re-use process as well.  
 
“Formerly a vineyard hill, this area has turned more than 100 years ago into the 
most avant-garde urban place, reflecting the ambitions for technological 
advancement and social change of the country. The Carol park built as an 
international exhibition, the technical museum, the first train station in Bucharest, 
the astronomical observatory and many other points in the area made this site once 
a melting pot of innovation, leisure and urban dynamics.” Zeppelin Association 
 
During WW2, military equipment was produced here, whereas in communist times, 
the industrial heritage was translated into workers’ pride, the area becoming a 
worker neighbourhood. The producer pride is still seen today, when some of the 
former workers are still living in the area, or even working at Hesper.  
 
“What we are aiming to do is to open a place of significance for the southwestern 
area of the city (perhaps not the densest in leisure activities), build a platform to 
bring diverse cultural programmes and cultural content to both nearby residents 
and to the active groups in the city. We want to give the place a community, and 
to give communities a place.”  Zeppelin Association

Halele Carol is located in and around some of the buildings of the Hesper factory 
terrain. Hesper is proud to be one of the oldest, still-working factories of Bucharest, 
a testament to the city’s industrial transformation. The factory has been 
continuously producing since the 19th century, making it a living piece of history 
and an important part of Bucharest’s heritage. 
“Industrial activity has continued on this location for over 130 years. Currently, 
Hesper is the most important producer of hydraulic pumps and gear motors in 
Romania. It is one of the very few factories that are still active in Romania and 
especially in Bucharest.” Mirela Dobre, Hesper SA 
 
The specific objectives of the project were to stop the degradation of historical 
buildings and preserve their value; to find new functions for the empty buildings 
(without hindering the production activities in the used buildings); to open a few 
access points to the park and the street and facilitate public access, all while 
keeping a strong connection to the values of the place – “manufacturing and 
creation” and the local pride connected to manufacturing. 
 
Although Halele Carol is not a listed monument, it is located in an area protected 
for its heritage value (protected area 6) and borders the Carol park area which 
also benefits from similar protection (area 82). The owner of Halele Carol does not 
intend to list the building as heritage, as current Romanian heritage law implies 
many administrative and bureaucratic burdens for listing a monument. 
Nevertheless, Halele Carol are still seen by the owner, its users and the wider 
public as part of Bucharest’s industrial heritage. The lack of heritage protection for 
the buildings means they are more vulnerable in the face of a growing real estate 
market, as well as have less resources available for their maintenance. On the 
other side, Halele Carol’s lack of heritage status also made its adaptive re-use 
model more feasible, as less regulations apply. 
 
Protected area 63, in which Halele Carol is included, is considered to have the 
maximum level of protection, meaning that the architectural ensemble of the 
neighbourhood is protected, and interventions that protect or accentuate the 
architectural, historical or urban values of the area are allowed. Function changes 
of buildings are allowed if the original functions do not meet current requirements. 
Luxury and speciality services (such as art galleries, antique shops or consultancy 
offices), as well as small bars and restaurants, are also allowed as long as they do 
not disturb the architectural ensemble, the natural vegetation, or as long as they 
don’t imply the creation of more parking areas. It is forbidden to carry out 
interventions that would damage the buildings or the area, that would lead to 
increasing pollution or traffic disturbances, as well as interventions that would 
disturb the nearby buildings or the water sewage system.  
 
Protected area 82, representing the Carol Park, is set as the park representing 
a location of reference for Bucharest’s image and structure. It also benefits from 
the maximum protection level, as area 63 does. The current function (park) cannot 
be changed. The only interventions allowed are those for conserving the current 
natural elements, constructions or spaces.  
 
Nevertheless, interventions onto buildings that are not historical monuments, but 
are places within the protected area surrounding the monuments, often also need 
the approval of the ministry or of the empowered public services, if applicable.

11 Influences  
Several themes and projects influenced the process of transformation around 
Halele Carol. Many important lessons came from the Netherlands and its experts: 
recycling space, applying reversible solutions, starting small and steady instead of 
creating grand ambitions. Local projects like Creative Factories Bucharest, done in 
collaboration with international experts, were also a trigger for Halele Carol. The 
Carol Factory project was another event done by Zeppelin using Norwegian funds, 
that activated the area through arts. The research on industrial heritage as a 
resource, done by the Romanian Architect Association and Zeppelin in 2013, was 
an important stepping stone in the adaptive re-use direction of Halele Carol.  
 
Several Dutch projects stood at the base for the Halele Carol transformation. The 
following projects of adaptive re-use of industrial heritage were seen as 
inspiration: 
• Westergasfabriek: example for adaptive re-use of industrial heritage, 
Westergasfabriek started with its buildings being used for temporary 
projects, in order to ensure organic growth. Westergasfabriek hosts leisure 
& cultural events, horeca facilities in a symbiotic relation between innovation 
and heritage, concrete and nature, or open and intimate spaces. Liesbeth 
Jansen from Linkeroever, one of the Dutch experts involved in the Halele 
Carol project, brought Westergasfabriek to the table to inspire the step-by-
step area activation process through temporary usage.  
• NDSM: An area in the North of Amsterdam formerly used for maritime 
docks, NDSM has been transformed from a relic of a declining industry into 
a cultural hotspot for alternative activities. Urban activists and creatives 
focused on giving new functions to the already existing industrial buildings, 
which now activate as even spaces, creative industries offices, restaurants, 
or even a luxury hotel located in a crane. There was no overall project for 
the transformation. Instead, the transformation happened through small, 
affordable interventions that organically brought a creative spirit into the 
area, which is something that Halele Carol implemented as well. 
• Strijp S: A symbol of the city’s industrial character, Strijp S is a good 
practice of industrial heritage re-use in Eindhoven, the home of Philips. A 
former factory, Strijp S transformed into a creative hub of living spaces, 
businesses, leisure facilities and education institutions through the common 
efforts of the community and involved policymakers. Similar to other cases 
in the Netherlands, Strijp S started through temporary usage of the 
buildings in order to ensure sustainability and an organic growth. The first 
step was opening one building for Eindhoven’s creative community, a 
measure that Halele Carol also implemented.  
 
Other heritage re-use projects happened in the nearby area of Halele Carol. One 
of them is the regeneration of the Vama Antrepozite – currently known as The Ark 
– which took place between 2006 and 2008, where a co-working place and 
restaurant are now located, after a project started by architect Doru Frolu. The 
Bragadiru palace next door has also undergone transformation, and is now active 
as event space and hosts one of Bucharest’s most renowned restaurants, Mahala, 
that takes classic Romanian dishes and brings them to high cuisine. Lastly, Nod 
Makerspace was set up in 2015 in a former Cotton Factory, also in the vicinity of 
Halele Carol. The space is still one of the most important cultural hotspots in the 
South of Bucharest.

12 Context  
  
Picture 9. Map of Bucharest. The red indicator represents Halele Carol 
12.1 Socio-geographic description 
The south of Bucharest is one of the poorer sides of the city, with less 
infrastructure, more poverty and ethnical segregation than in the other areas. 
Following the communist urbanism plan in 1980 which reshaped the city, the 
separation between South and North became more prominent. After 1990, most 
of the industry which took place in this region stopped, and with them the biggest 
economic motor of the area.  
 
Nowadays, the North of Bucharest represents the business quarter, with areas like 
Pipera booming with newly built tower office buildings. The South is generally 
regarded as a more residential area of Bucharest, including many former workers’ 
neighbourhoods, such as Filaret-Rahova. Many abandoned buildings can be found 
here as well. The South of Bucharest has some of the largest parks as well, 
including Carol Park, Tineretului Park, and the newly acknowledged and protected 
National Park of Vacaresti. 
 
Halele Carol is located in sector 4 of Bucharest, a diverse district with an uneven 
demographic composition across neighbourhoods. According to the 2011, survey 
287,800 people lived in the district. Halele Carol borders sector 5 of Bucharest and 
is actually closer to the Sector 5 municipality. This can be seen as an example of 
how the sectors of Bucharest divide the city in slices rather than strategic areas, 
and sometimes prevent zonal collaboration from happening, as sector 
management is very politicised and neighbourhoods might fall within two different 
sectors (e.g. the centre of Bucharest falls partially within all sectors). 
 
Filaret-Rahova is one of the poorest regions in Bucharest with a high social 
vulnerability, being home to what some regard as one of Bucharest’s ghetto

(Amurgului) while Unirii is one of the regions with higher incomes 
and lower social vulnerability (Armas & Gavris, 2016). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Picture 10.  Map of social vulnerability in Bucharest at 2011 census – red signifying 
highest vulnerability, light blue lowest (Armas & Gavris, 2016) 
 
The Filaret Rahova neighbourhood is quite close to the main centre of the city and 
it is easily accessible from most neighbourhoods. The site is well reachable by car, 
bus and trams. Three night-bus lines are also passing by the park. The closest 
metro station is about 2 km away. 
12.2 Economic description 
Many SMEs and service providers are located in Sector 4. The service industry is 
well-developed, especially the telecommunications, financial services, research 
and education, transport, tourism and culture, and trade. The industrial heritage 
of the Carol park area is still visible nowadays, with the Hesper factory still 
producing hydraulic pumps. Other businesses in the Carol park neighbourhood and 
Protected Area 63 are restaurants, bars, hotels, co-working spaces, cultural spaces 
and supermarkets (Primaria Sectorului 4, 2014). 
 
Romania has one the largest percentages of home owners in the EU, with a country 
average of 96% of adults (Sisea, 2014). Compared to other countries, there are 
few housing corporations active in Bucharest. After Sector 1, Sector 4 and 5 are 
the most expensive ones from Bucharest when it comes to real estate. Although 
less developed, the areas become more interesting for residential and industrial 
investments. According to imobiliare.ro, the average price per square meter in the 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Observatory Case Analysis: Halele Carol 
20 
 
Carol Park area is around EUR 1550 (the Bucharest average in 
March 2019 was EUR 1327/sqm) (Imobiliare.ro, 2019). 
 
Most lands in Sector 4 are private property according to the municipal registers. 
Some public utility services (water, sewage, gas) are also under private ownership. 
The Carol park area has mixed ownership structures in place: some industrial 
buildings are private property, such as the Hesper factory or the Match Factory 
(Fabrica de Chibrituri). Other buildings situated around the Carol Park are owned 
by public institutions, such as the Astronomic Observatory, the Technical Museum 
and the Filaret Weather. The Carol park itself is managed by the Municipality of 
Bucharest (AIR & Zeppelin, 2011). 
13 Policy  
The following laws applies to the activities in the area: Law 422/2001 on historic 
monuments, Law 6/2008 on technical and industrial heritage, Law 350/2001 on 
landscaping and urban planning. The Rahova-Filaret area is a protected area nr. 
63, and the park represents protected area nr. 82. Both areas and their 
implications for interventions are described in the Heritage chapter. The General 
Urban Plan of Bucharest (PUG Bucharest from 2000) and the current Area Urban 
Plan Carol Park (PUZ Parcul Carol from 2006) apply to the activities in the area 
surrounding Halele Carol.  
 
The General Urban Plan of Bucharest (PUG), mentions that the Carol Park area is 
reserved for activities of goods and services production. The Protected Area nr. 63 
documentation also implies regulation for the area, albeit mostly for the residential 
areas and not the industrial buildings. The Area Urban Plan Carol Park (PUZ Parcul 
Carol) includes Hesper factory in the green area along with other buildings located 
in  the  park,  meaning  they  can  be  converted  to  spaces  for  cultural  and  leisure 
activities.  It  was  foreseen  that  the  existent  constructions of  the  Hesper  factory 
would be transformed in leisure functions (sport, museums, exhibitions, shows and 
performances) and integrated into the park. The inclusion of Halele Carol in both 
the protected area nr. 63 and the Area Urban Plan ‘Carol Park’ (PUZ Parcul Carol) 
frame  the  site  for  potential  repurposing  into  leisure  facilities  (sport,  events, 
exhibitions),  creating  opportunities  for  the  adaptive  re-use  of  the  factory’s 
buildings, and making Halele Carol possible. 
 
The Vice Mayor announced that Carol park will be regenerated to become a cultural 
pole of Bucharest in the next 10 years, after a project for the park’s revitalisation 
was proposed and voted in July 2018. A PUZ (Area Urban Plan) for the new project 
is currently being developed.  Elements of the park such as the Zodiac Fountain or 
other industrial buildings will be reconditioned and entered into the cultural circuit 
of the city. The Technical Museum is planned to be taken back under public 
management and for extension into a Museum of Science and Technology that 
would include other buildings in the area such as the Electric Factory Filaret. The 
Bosianu house, currently belonging to the National Institute for Meteorology, would 
also be renovated and become publicly accessible.

14 Impact  
Although not the first case of adaptive re-use of industrial heritage in Romania, 
Halele Carol is regarded as one of the best practices in the field of rehabilitation of 
buildings through repurposing them with cultural functions. Halele Carol is also 
one of the best examples of starting a re-use project without investment and 
through temporary functions.  
 
Nevertheless, the project did not have a general impact on the local community 
surrounding Halele Carol, as the community has not been involved from the early 
stages of the project, except from the workers at Hesper factory who attended the 
events. This made it difficult to involve it later on, and to make the Halele Carol 
project also representative for the local users. The Hesper factory represents a 
constant element in the local history and memory. Therefore, one important 
learning point is to involve the local community early in the project so that local 
people become part of the new developments. 
 
The project has been well-received in the creative world, with appreciative 
comments on the industrial revival of the area, and the re-use of the existing 
buildings instead on constructing new ones. Most public opinions see Halele Carol 
as an important point on Bucharest’s cultural map. Expirat Club, located here, is 
regarded mostly positively, as one of the clubs who made safety regulations and 
interventions a priority after the Colectiv fire in 2015.  
 
The re-use of the space increased a certain attachment to the area from the 
creative community of Bucharest. The idea of an alternative space, needed for the 
creative industries in Bucharest, was attractive to the cultural community in the 
city that constantly looks for new spaces to enrich their activity. Halele Carol also 
provides a special identity for the young creatives of Bucharest. Although it did not 
manage to involve the community around it, Halele Carol still has a historical value

for the people around, some of which still work at the Hesper 
factory, and are holding the place dear. 
 
“A direct impact of our project is that the name and the place are still very visible. 
The name and its attractivity for the cultural community in Bucharest, which actually 
translates to a high impact for Bucharest. There are people who understood that 
many of the centre equipment for leisure and entertainment could come here and 
that the park area could become very important for Bucharest. And that would mean 
a lot for the people living in the South of the city, which is actually the poorest part 
when it comes to leisure facilities” Constantin Goagea 
 
 
Picture 12.  Post Industrial Design – exhibition at Halele Carol, photo by Vlad Bâscă  
 
In general, the narrative presents Halele Carol as a ‘cultural hotspot’ or a ‘cultural 
hub’ of Bucharest, emerged from the adaptive re-use of the industrial heritage. 
Halele Carol is placed in the same best practice category as other industrial re-use 
examples across the country, such as The Ark and Nod Makerspace in Bucharest, 
or Fabrica de Pensule in Cluj. The ‘Nordic vibe’ of the new design and architectural 
elements (such as the wooden constructions) are appreciatively mentioned at 
times. 
 
The Municipality of Bucharest developed a plan to further develop the Carol park 
into a cultural centre of Bucharest, as described in the previous chapters. This is 
based on the value and potential of the area, which the Halele Carol project also 
highlighted and tapped into. Halele Carol can be considered the project that put 
Carol park back on the cultural map of Bucharest. 
 
Regarding the impact on the economic life of the area, there have not been any 
jobs created through the project yet. The project did not directly enable the launch 
of new initiatives and/or start-ups. Nevertheless, it did open a new leisure and 
cultural area. As a result, more attention was drawn to the neighbourhood and 
several new leisure services / facilities opened here. As described previously, the 
South of Bucharest has been customarily seen as less developed than the North. 
Therefore, Halele Carol expanded the cultural centre of the city towards the South, 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2

putting the area on the leisure map. As a result, the 
neighbourhood also saw more people coming here. More leisure activities 
developed in the area: Expirat Club is a popular nightclub; parties and events have 
been organised in the buildings of the Astronomic Institute; other bars and 
restaurants (ex: Ponton, now closed) started to appear and/or see more guests.

Executive summary 
Stará Tržnica (Old Market Hall) is a historical building in the centre of Bratislava. 
The building closed down after years of unsuccessful attempts by the 
municipality to keep the market alive. Years later the market hall reopened with 
a redevelopment plan proposed by the Alianca Stará Tržnica (Old Market Hall 
Alliance), combining a food market every Saturday with cultural events on other 
days, as well as two cafés, a grocery shop, a cooking school and a soda water 
manufacture. Rethinking the opportunities of the Old Market Hall allows the 
organisation to run the building in an economically sustainable way, while 
gradually renovating it and creating a new event venue and meeting space in the 
heart of the city.

2 The story of the building  
The Old Market Hall of Bratislava, designed by the city engineer Gyula Laubner, 
was completed on October 31, 1910. The building, situated at the edge of 
Bratislava’s historical centre and built in connection with the old town’s wall, was 
operating as a municipal marketplace until 1960. During the Communist times, 
the building’s market function has gradually deteriorated. Between 1960 and 
1989, the building hosted a television warehouse, studio and a variety of cultural 
productions. Between 1989 and 1996, the building stood empty, until in 1996 the 
municipality began its renovation. While the renovated building operated as a 
market between 1998 and 2008, small shops were built along its edges. The 
municipality’s efforts to revive the building as a mono-functional market hall did 
not succeed: in the last years of the municipal management of the market, only 
six stalls were left open, all the others were closed. The remaining vendors, 
failing to compete with supermarkets, hardly provided any revenue for the 
market hall and the building generated significant losses for the municipality, 
about 30,000 euros a year. In the years following its closure in 2008, the market

hall was occasionally used as a stage set for TV show shootings and gala events. 
While it hosted around 15-20 private events a year, the building stood empty for 
the rest of the year, for around 350 days.  
The original spaces of the building have been modified at various moments. In 
the 1990s, the Municipality renovated the market hall and small shops were built 
along its edges. In 2013, when the Old Market Hall Alliance gained access to the 
building, the market hall was fragmented into smaller spaces divided by walls, 
reminiscent of a badly functioning shopping mall. Besides these divisions, the 
building’s new tenants faced many previously invisible problems. Besides the 
damaged floors and other surfaces, the building’s infrastructure was also in a 
deteriorated state: the heating, cooling, air distribution functions did not 
function, neither did electricity work.  
“If you search for a concert hall in the city centre, this would be one of the 
top choices for you. If you want to make a conference, it is probably the 
best place in the city centre, especially if you would like to have some kind 
of community feeling, and don’t want to go to a hotel. Practically you are 
left with no other choices.” Jan Mazur

3 The initiative 
“For years, there had been various initiatives that were seeking the 
support of politically influent groups to get their grip on the market hall. 
The fact that we made a public proposal and played in an open way made 
us less vulnerable to attacks and gave us a broad public support.” Gábor 
Bindics 
The Old Market Hall Alliance, an NGO established in order to elaborate a special 
programme for the building, was created by a team of experts, eleven people 
from different disciplines. The team was composed by people with real hands-on 
experience. One founding member of the Alliance had been running concerts for 
20 years and knew everyone in the music fiend as well as all details related to 
running events; another member had been organising markets for years and was 
ready to bring this experience into the market hall.  
At the time when the idea of rethinking the market hall emerged, Gábor Bindics, 
one of the founders had been running the cultural centre Dunaj for years. Dunaj 
was about 50 meters from the Old Market Hall, and Gábor and his colleagues 
passed by the vacant building every day. In the same time, many people were 
engaged in discussions about the fate of the market hall on a variety of forums. 
When the 11 people who later founded the Old Market Hall Alliance met each 
other, they all nurtured the same ambition to try to find a way to revive the 
market hall. The original idea was not to take over the management of the 
building but to create a project that looks into the history of the market hall and 
explores the reasons of its failure. By 2012, their ambition had gradually 
changed: they increasingly saw their role not only in creating a study but in 
developing the project itself. In 2012, the NGO Old Market Hall Alliance was 
established in order to elaborate a special programme for the building.  
“152 pages of the proposal were letters of interest, from corporations 
stating that they want to organise private events there, to embassies 
stating their interest in hiring space for events in the market hall. It gave 
us a lot of credibility that we could show that many people trust us.” Jan 
Mazur   
In 2012, the Alliance made a proposal to the Municipality for running the market 
hall, including a detailed economic offer and supported by many letters of 
interests from a variety of organisations. The proposal was to organise a weekly 
market on every Saturday, combined with other events on weekdays and renting 
out on a permanent basis the smaller spaces of the building to different services 
related to the market. The proposal also included a rental fee and detailed 
timing. The Alliance built up a broad public backing for the proposal. Support 
from various communities in the city helped the association convince the 
Municipality about the public interest of the proposal. 
“There were hundreds of people watching the assembly online so there 
was a kind of public pressure on politicians as well. An important part of 
our legitimacy was that we managed to communicate this project well: the 
public understood that this is a project that will serve their purpose.” Jan 
Mazur 
Despite discussions about the need of a public competition the Alliance convinced 
the Municipality to use a specific clause in the law that allows the municipality to 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Stará Tržnica Bratislava Observatory Case 
8 
 
grant an exemption from competition to a strong proposal if it is approved by a 
vote in the City Council. The first vote took place in February 2013, but the 
agreement attracted criticism and legal attacks. Therefore, another City Council 
vote was needed in the Spring of 2013 that gave the final approval to the 
Alliance’s plan. The Municipal Assembly vote also attracted a significant interest 
from the side of citizens – it was the most viewed assembly until then – and this 
pressure resulted in the Municipal Assembly voting in favour of the proposal. Due 
to the exemption of competition, there was no public procurement process to 
access the building, but a concession agreement.  
“In general, it is good to have open calls, but in the case of the Market 
Hall, no one has prepared any process for years, and the idea of public 
competition came up only when our proposal was put on the table. The 
place laid dormant for years and it needed initiative.” Illah Van Oljen 
The Old Market Hall Alliance received the keys to the building in September 
2013. The first event, a food market was organised on September 22, and it was 
followed by regular market days, first once a month and twice a month after the 
first year. In 2014, the various spaces of the market hall were tested through 
pop-up uses, and these uses informed the renovations of these spaces in the 
following years. After a trial period and a temporary closure for renovations, the 
market hall reopened in March 2015. Since September 2015, the weekly 
Saturday market has been operating continuously, with other events gradually 
developed to complement it.

4 Activities 
“What works is the blend of activities, multi-functionality, to combine 
functions of those activities that do not generate solid revenue with those 
that can generate revenue for you: this way you can subsidise the former.” 
Jan Mazur  
The Old Market Hall Alliance created a special programme with a flexible forum 
where one can put any content one wants according to one’s needs and 
functions. During the week, when there is simply not enough critical mass to 
attend markets, the building is used as a concert hall, a ballroom for companies, 
a conference hall, or a workshop space. The most precious day, Saturday, when 
people have time, is reserved for a food market. As the market begins at 8am, 
this also means that there are no events on Friday night, otherwise there would 
be no enough time to clean up the hall before the market.  
“This is a really strong message that the most precious day is given to the 
public.” Jan Mazur  
The process of reviving the food market in the hall also coincided with the 
moment when people in Slovakia began to be interested in local food and locally 
produced goods: people were looking for alternatives. The farmers’ market 
opened in the Old Market Hall just before alternative supermarkets selling local 
produce emerged. Reviving the food market required a lot of community 
organisation though. As the market organisers did not succeed in bringing back 
earlier vendors to the market, they had to find new vendors with less experience.  
“As the market hall was to function as a cultural centre and a market in the 
same time, we felt it was good to start with a monthly market first, to try 
out the space. The space was being reconstructed and rebuilt at the time: 
we had to build a whole market in a building that was changing every 
week.” Illah van Oljen  
 
The food market was never meant to generate revenue for the Market Hall. It is 
the ultimate public event in the market hall: its objective was to attract visitors 
and make the market hall work. It was decided early on that Saturday would be 
kept for food markets and all other events have to find other days. The Saturday 
market organises children’s theatre every week, there are dedicated spaces for 
kids and seniors with no obligation to consume anything. Minorities that live in 
the city are regularly invited to present their food and music in the market hall. 
The building has a used oil-collecting facility and soon will have a composter. 
Most transport to and from the building is organised by cargo bikes. There are 
The food market is at the core of the Old Market Hall. The food market 
component of the Old Market Hall Alliance came through Illah van Oljen, a 
Dutch urbanist who began organising local markets in Bratislava in 2011 by 
closing off streets, inviting producers and inviting neighbours. Together with 
Slow Food Bratislava, Illah wrote a plan on how to bring back the food market 
into the Old Market Hall and, emphasising the importance of gradual, organic 
growth. For the first half year, the market was organised once a month and it 
allowed the organisers to test different settings. In the following year, markets 
were organised twice a month, and a year and a half into the project, the 
market became a weekly event.

many educational events taking place in the building that also function as 
services.  
The food market runs with about 20-30 vendors in the summer, and about 100 
in winter. It is often combined a variety of events, pop-up stores, kids’ events, 
design and antique markets, wine events, thematic markets. One of the biggest 
events of the year is the Christmas market that includes a food market and a 
street market outside the market hall, uniting the indoor and outdoor spaces. 
The Christmas market has over 20,000 visitors and more than 350 people apply 
for stands but the market can only host 116 of them.  
The food market has also generated various synergies with other tenants and 
venues within the market hall: the café has an open door towards the market 
and plays music the whole morning; restaurants or the cooking school’s kitchen 
buy the remaining vegetables to make sure vendors go home with no produce 
left. The bike sharing shop offers a courier service to deliver the groceries bought 
to one’s doorstep.  
“It was always our big dream when we got this place, yes the inside is a 
public space but let’s take the inside and outside as one. With the 
Christmas market we managed to bring this back.” Illah van Oljen  
Spaces of the market hall that face the outside, looking at the neighbouring 
square and streets are rented out to permanent tenants. These are businesses 
that all contribute to the market hall’s operation with their own means, with 
specific activities, resources or with opening hours and services adapted to the 
needs of more vulnerable groups. The spaces at the outer parts of the market 
hall have been used since 2014, first to test various uses and later rented out to 
regular tenants. The tenant structure has gradually changed in the project’s first 
5 years, as experiences helped the Alliance to adjust its rental structure. 
“The proportion between market and social projects depends on the price 
you charge per square meters. If you run a market price, then non-market 
participants obviously cannot take it if they don’t have a subsidy. If there 
is no grant that could help them operate with market rents, then you have 
to go down if you want to create social value.” Jan Mazur 
Originally, the Alliance began to develop its strategy of renting out spaces as the 
creation of a “portfolio of services” that members thought the market hall 
needed. The first open call for tenants of the market hall’s spaces envisioned five 
functions for the building: a family space where we are where families can come 
and leave kids in the corner and have a coffee, a restaurant and café, a grocery 
store and a kitchen to be used by members for cooking classes and to cook food 
to be sold elsewhere. After the failure of some of the tenants from the first 
round, it took a few years to have all the businesses stabilise themselves.  
Lab is a cafeteria on the ground floor but also a fabrication lab, a basement 
workshop with woodcutters, laser cutters, 3D printer and other tools where one 
can do digital fabrication. It works on a prepaid membership basis and 
contributes to an emerging community around the Lab. Next to it, there is also a 
bike sharing shop that has been very much in demand since its opening and 
that also offers delivery service for the market shoppers. Another tenant is 
Foodstock, a restaurant or canteen that composts all its organic waste, thus 
inspiring a planned waste system for the whole market and the neighbourhood. 
Foodstock also helps with the community kitchen organised on Saturdays where 
various minorities present their food and products. There is also a grocery 
shop: the idea was to create a locally sourced store where one can find food and 
products as local as possible. On the other side of the market, there is a wine

bar that is open all day long and offers local wines at affordable prices. Inside 
the market hall, there are other businesses: a soda producer, in which the Old 
Market Hall Alliance is also a small shareholder; and a brewery that takes care 
of the square in front of the market hall, its cleaning, new furniture and all 
related investments.

Dobre Dobré is an organisation that works with homeless people. The Alliance 
invited the organisation to run a cafeteria inside the market hall building, a place 
that would connect with the ambiance of the market hall and employ homeless 
staff. Compared to the other venues inside the market hall, the Alliance 
estimated the value of the space as 2400 euros per month: given the social focus 
of the organisation, Dobre Dobré was offered a 560 euros rental fee. Despite this 
subsidised rent, Dobre Dobré could not develop into a sustainable business. The 
following business, a winery, received the space at the subsidised rent of 1600 
euros, in exchange to have the venue open from the morning, offer authentic 
wines and allow people to spend time without continuously consuming.  
Some tenants could not develop a sustainable economic model: a café operated 
by a social enterprise employing homeless people ended up producing deficits, 
and so did a kid’s centre where families did not spend enough to help the place 
survive. Similarly, a cooking school formerly located in the inside of the building, 
that made food for kindergartens, sold to the neighbouring restaurants and also 
worked with refugees also left the market hall.  
“When we saw that some social businesses could not maintain themselves, 
we changed our strategy: instead of looking for a social project and

offering space to them, we look for a functioning business that we ask to 
provide some added value in exchange for lower rent.” Gábor Bindics

5 Renovations 
“When we walked into the building we found many bad solutions, a big 
part of the technical equipment didn’t work. We knew that we cannot make 
the building work perfectly from the first day on.” Gábor Bindics  
The main concept of rethinking the building was to create a space as 
multifunctional and flexible as possible, a large open space that can host various 
kinds of events, ranging from markets and conferences to concerts. In order to 
help the space adapt to different events, specific, versatile and easy-to-arrange 
tables were bought to support all these formats.  
One of the biggest challenges in the reconstruction process was to coordinate the 
different phases of the renovation with activities like the market that had to 
adapt to new circumstances and new parts of the building at each edition. A 
month after the Alliance took charge of the building, a fire security control 
revealed 54 security issues. Complying with safety regulations was a costly 
process: only repainting some surfaces with fireproof paint costed 50,000 euros, 
while revising the fire safety system, installing a new lightning rod, new doors, 
fire-extinguishers, fire alarms and a regulated heating system costed around 
100-150,000 euros.

After making the spaces secure, the following phase included renovating the 
shops and other street front spaces, fixing their water and electricity 
infrastructures so that they can be rented out. This was followed by the 
renovation of the toilets, the floors, the lights, important details that enable the 
individual operations. In some cases, the Alliance made an agreement with 
future tenants who would take care of the renovations and costs would be 
redacted from the rental fee.

Sound is a key challenge in all buildings whose business model depends 
on large events. When the Alliance took charge of the market hall, they 
measured the sound insulation of the building’s walls and windows and it 
gave different results than official documents of the building that proved 
to be misleading. Following complaints from the neighbourhood, the 
association undertook a large process to insulate further the building’s 
walls and windows facing residential buildings: this operation costed 
50,000 euros. After the insulation, the market hall has been capable of 
accommodating slightly higher volume but cannot host larger concerts. 
With the limited authorised volume level, concerts are muted by the 
noise of the public: in the presence of 2000 people, the allowed music 
volume is not enough to satisfy the concert-goers.

6 Heritage 
“When we first entered the market hall, its open space was fragmented by 
smaller structures, kiosks erected in the 1990s. We declared that our goal 
is not to build on all the layers that were added to this market hall, but to 
give back this space to the city. Our goal was to open the space physically 
and mentally. We also repainted the interiors to the original green colour, 
erasing the interventions of the 1990s. All our actions fit to the protected 
status of the building. We benefited from heritage protection: we wanted 
to make use of the advantages of the building as it was invented in 1910.” 
Gábor Bindics 
Bratislava’s Old Market Hall is a nationally protected cultural heritage building. 
The protection concerns the hall’s columns and the windows, as well as the outer 
appearance of the building. Therefore, there are no modifications allowed in the 
building, especially when they impact the outer look of the market hall. Outside 
the entire look of the building had to be kept, including the colours, doors and 
materials. For minor interventions, ranging from changing colours at the outside 
of the building to insulating windows, the Alliance needed permissions from the 
regional heritage office. In order to better insulate the building, for instance, an 
expensive solution was implemented: a second, thicker glass layer was built 
inside the market hall, in order to keep the original look of the building but adapt 
it to events that require heating in winter. Inside it was enough to maintain the 
appearance and colours of the skeleton structure but the association enjoyed 
relative freedom in rearranging the market inside the building.  
“We started by making a study about the market hall’s past. We found that 
in 1910, there was a soda manufacturer in the building: therefore, we 
established a new soda manufacturer. There was a grocery shop run by 
Ernő Dvorák: this is why we call our pub Ernő Dvorák, to point back to the 
past of the building.” Gábor Bindics  
Reopening the market hall as a food market was easy: building on the history of 
the building and the legacy of the street markets organised by Alliance members, 
the association had a significant public support in its endeavour. 
“It happened in the first few markets that people would come into the 
building, look up and look down and start crying. Overwhelmed with 
stories and histories around the market. The fact that this was historically 
for such a long time a market space, and this whole square was a market 
space basically gave a huge pat in the back for the whole project. We 
didn’t have to convince anyone.” Illah van Oljen   
7 Regulations and policies  
“The relationship with the municipality is good. It’s not always easy to 
explain or convince them, but the relationship is professional, we don’t 
argue over small things or even large things.” Jan Mazur  
Regulations concerning the renovation and operating of the building are not 
optimal. The market hall’s renovation by the association has met some legislative 
barriers. The previous renovation in 1996-98 carried out by the Municipality for 
the equivalent of 13 million euros today included many elements like an 
escalator in the basement that had never been used and did not correspond to 
the new uses of the building. This escalator was built so expensively in the 1990s 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Stará Tržnica Bratislava Observatory Case 
15 
 
that after two decades, its value was still booked at 30,000 euros in the 
Municipality’s accounts, making it bureaucratically complicated to remove the 
escalator and turning this into a 2-year procedure.  
The Alliance’s relationship with the municipality is professional and is based on 
cooperation. On a regular basis, the Alliance needs approval from the 
Municipality for the investments. The Alliance needs to communicate towards the 
Municipality all investments into the building as these investments, including 
newly purchased equipment will belong to the building owned by the city. Before 
each expenditure, the association needs to provide an investment plan to be 
reviewed by a specific body – consisting of three municipal officers and two-three 
people from the Old Market Hall Alliance – that convenes and goes through each 
item of the plan, before sending it further to a municipal vote. Besides this 
committee, there is also another contractual body created between the Alliance 
and the Municipality, consisting of four people from the Municipal Assembly, that 
reviews and supervises the activities of the association.  
“Most problems we encountered within the Municipality were not personal 
but structural. Municipalities are structured in a regulatory way. Municipal 
departments are not working pro-actively and they have difficulties in 
dealing with innovative ideas and helping those who come with a proposal 
to the city. The Market Hall gives a precedent to these structures in how to 
work with innovative proposals coming from the outside.” Gábor Bindics  
While the building used to be registered as a market hall, for a period starting in 
the 1960s, its destination of use was changed into cultural space. When the 
Alliance began to use the building as a market in 2013, the organisers needed 
permissions and it made the process more complicated. In the first months, 
markets were organised with specific permits. It took a year for the association 
to change the building’s legal status into a market hall that made it easier to 
organise markets. In some cases, the market’s legal status was not enough to 
support all the activities needed by a contemporary market. For instance, for 
cooking food inside a building, a chimney is needed; however, it is complicated 
to build a chimney without altering a heritage-protected building’s appearance. 
Therefore, for a long period, the street food market was organised outside the 
market hall, before organisers found a technical solution to lead chimneys out 
the windows.  
 
8 The business model  
“It is important to convince people that we can think at the scale of 
millions of euros. With upscaling, the potentially available investment also 
grows. We can help initiatives with insights about what banks like to give 
money for and how much certain investments would cost.” Gábor Bindics 
Social enterprises: despite its structure as an association, members of the 
Old Market Hall Alliance consider themselves as a social enterprise: they do not 
pay dividends or take out profit from the association for themselves. A new law 
about the functioning of social enterprises that includes incentives, investment 
money, equity and debt instruments is potentially interesting for the Alliance to 
adapt its organisational form.

Before engaging in the contract with the Municipality, the Alliance made an 
estimation of the renovation costs with the help of various experts. Without any 
high-tech equipment, renovating the floors, the windows as well as complying 
with all fire safety requirements was estimated to cost between 700,000 and 1 
million euros, with at least 4-500,000 to make the building operational. After 5 
years, a bit more than 1 million euros were spent on the building, making the 
market hall fully operating in the technical sense. By the second year, the Market 
Hall began to produce revenues and by the third year the economic model began 
to work. In March 2019, the initial bank loan was paid back and the Market Hall 
broke even. After the basic renovation items, the Alliance now begins investing in 
more value-related equipment like a composter and other extras.  
 
 “At the time, I began working for the Erste Bank as an advisor in the 
social bank division. From inside, I saw what makes a project suitable for a 
loan. By then the Market Hall had events, we had numbers, partners and 
rental contracts. All these helped us to get a loan from the social bank 
division while a standard bank would have seen us too risky.” Gábor 
Bindics  
The renovations began with a loan from Erste Bank. At the time the bank opened 
a social banking division with about 10 million euros to support projects that 
would be considered too risky by traditional loan schemes. The Market Hall 
Alliance received a loan of about 200,000 euros with 4% interest. As the 
association was not the owner of the building, they could not put the market hall 
as a collateral to the loan: therefore members of the association needed to offer 
their own personal properties as a collateral to the bank.  
“Most banks have no other motivation than putting your organisation in 
their risk model and see how much interest they can give you. Social banks 
put their margins lower to allow more possibilities.” Jan Mazur  
The Market Hall produces a variety of revenues. The marketing cooperations 
provide about 1/3 of the total revenue. Volkswagen and Orange contribute with 
about 50-60,000 euros annually, in cash or in services. With Orange, for 
instance, the financial support is minimal but the services have a high value that 
account to about 100,000 euros in the past years. Orange provided machines 
(worth 70,000 euros) for the FabLab, and installed internet in the whole building 
(worth 20,000 euros). Orange also provided big data to the association about 
people passing by the market hall, in order to understand better their needs. 
Rent-to-investment scheme: the Alliance conceived the new market 
hall’s model to be economically sustainable and financially separated from the 
Municipality, with no public subsidies involved. The 15-year (10 years + 5 
years extension) contract signed between the Alliance and the Municipality 
states that the Alliance pays a symbolic 1 euro rent per year to the Municipality 
and has to invest 10.000 euros per month in the renovation of the market hall 
for the entire duration of the contract: this amounts to 120.000 euros per year 
and almost 2 million euros by the end of the contract. While the 10.000 euros 
monthly investment cannot include in-kind work, the investments of the 
tenants can be calculated as part of it. Each item of investment is overseen by 
a supervisory board that includes municipal officers and members of the 
association.

Volkswagen contributes in a similar way, the company paid in part for the 
renovation of the square in front of the market hall.  
Rental fees contribute to another third of the revenues. Besides the market hall’s 
large open space, the building contains a variety of smaller venues, accessible 
from the neighbouring streets, that are rented out to a variety of tenants on a 
regular basis. The selection of tenants in the market hall is based on open calls, 
thematic connections, potential cooperation with other tenants as well as the 
social value created. 
The last third of the revenues is provided by large events. Big part of the Market 
Hall’s revenue comes from about 16 solely private events per year, which, 
combined with privately-organised public events, adds up to 60-70% of the total 
revenue. This revenue is distributed in a year quite unevenly: the top season is 
October to December, with many Christmas events, while there are practically no 
events in July and August. The rent for a private event can run into several 
thousands of euros, up to 6.000 euros for a day – for this the association 
provides many services, including setting up the space. The great demand for 
the space is due to a specific situation in Bratislava that does not have many 
event venues of this kind: The Old Market Hall is possibly the only event venue if 
the centre that is so large and well-positioned, with an easy access for cars and 
public transportation alike. On the other hand, with all the events and the 
community support around the Old Market Hall, it has become one of the hippest 
places for private events. The interruption of this revenue stream by noise limits 
imposed on the venue in 2017 forced the Alliance to seek for new kinds of 
events, daytime conferences and other functions that correspond to the 
building’s dramaturgy and values. The success of this shift remains to be 
evaluated, together with other potential directions like attracting more 
marketing-related revenue or developing applications for funding.  
With the great success of the Old Market Hall, more revenues were collected than 
expected. With these revenues, the Alliance has already invested 6 or 7 years 
upfront in the building’s renovation. This is also justified by the uneven needs of 
the market hall where more investment was needed in the beginning of the 
building’s use in order to make it suitable for events and other activities. Despite 
the early investments, the renovation is an ongoing process: a bank loan was 
taken to reconstruct the floor and renovate all the windows. Besides the 
renovation, the association also bought a variety of sound and light equipment, 
tables for the market and a podium to build the stage.  
“When we apply for cultural funding, everyone asks why we need money 
after investing a million euros into the building. We need such funding for 
the ‘dramaturgy’ we would like to reach, with an ideal constellation of 
public and private events.” Gábor Bindics   
Most of the market hall’s operations can be maintained with the help of its 
revenues. Extra expenses can be financed by loans, as the Alliance by now has a 
good track record with banks, although funding of approximately 14,000 euros 
coming from EEA Grants also helped to make some investments in the building. 
Nevertheless, the organisation needs specific funding for specific projects like 
reorganising public spaces around the building. Although the Old Market Hall 
Alliance is not very successful in applying for public subsidies, the association 
took part in a Creative Europe project that helped the organisation with 120,000 
euros to activate 700,000 euros from private investors and the city.

“It’s a rare cultural heritage building and should be serving cultural 
functions. Increasing the rent beyond 10,000 euros a month would 
compromise the building’s public function.” Jan Mazur 
9 Governance and community 
“I always took it as my personal mission to conserve this community -
based content and functioning of this building. I always designed it this 
way. Even the market is inside and technically it is private space, we will 
always set it up as a public space. Nobody has to buy anything. Homeless, 
travellers who are lost, we had travellers falling asleep on the bench, we 
were always open to any group of people who have the same right to sit 
inside as outside.” Illah van Oljen   
The Old Market Hall Alliance has been from the beginning an NGO, an association 
founded by 11 civic persons who joined to revive the market hall. The association 
since then has been expanded and now has active and advisory members. The 
Alliance is the main tenant of the market hall and has the 10+5 years contract 
with the Municipality, and in turn, it also rents out the building’s various spaces 
to businesses and events. The association has also invested in some of the 
activities in the building: for instance, it has 50% shares in one of the businesses 
in the Market Hall building, the soda manufacturer.  
Volunteering work played an important role in building up the new market hall. 
Bringing forward their own initiative, members of the Old Market Hall Alliance 
had offered weeks and weeks of unpaid work, also supported by various forms of 
community involvement and institutional support. A diversity of cultural 
institutions and embassies also assured the Alliance about their support and this 
proved to be an important, if symbolic resource in gaining approval from the 
Municipality.  
Some activities in the market hall do not generate much income but contribute to 
tying together the community: a regularly organised bazaar allows people to 
donate and sell things and the revenues go into the reconstruction of the 
building.  
Although there is no formalised structure to bring together the tenants 
besides one-to-one contracts, the Old Market Hall Alliance organises regular 
meetings with the tenants to focus on how they can cooperate with one another 
in a mutually beneficial way. Some tenants began to cooperate without any 
matchmaking: the soda manufacturer provides soda to all the bars and 
restaurants, so does the brewery; the events communicate with the venues and 
the grocery store sources from our market vendors. Besides one-to-one 
cooperation, many tenants are also connected by joint projects. The new 
composting machine bought by the association will compost the organic waste of 
all tenants. The Alliance is also planning to establish a new association focusing 
on the public spaces around the market hall: the association, to be joined by all 
tenants of the market hall, will safeguard the public spaces and provide specific 
services such as cultural events. Furthermore, the new association will act as a 
platform to organise competitions and channel ideas and proposals towards the 
municipality.

10 Public space 
Before being converted into TV and cultural production studios, Bratislava’s Old 
Market Hall had always been a public space, connected to a large public square 
outside the building. After the 1960s, with the building converted into TV 
production studios, the square gradually lost its public role and was increasingly 
occupied by parking cars. For the Old Market Hall Alliance, opening the square 
and reconnecting it to the market hall creates public value and contributes to the 
building’s economic model as well.  
“We started working with the square outside the market hall to bring it 
back into use: it was not inventing a new function but try to bring people 
back doing what they used to do before.” Illah van Oljen  
The Old Market Hall Alliance has been engaged with the revitalisation of the 
neighbouring public spaces. Investment in the surrounding public spaces has 
created an important impact: with small interventions like 5000 euros invested in 
chairs and serving drinks, the square in front of the market hall has been filled 
with life, especially in Summer and Autumn, with hundreds of people. Allowing 
the Market Hall to use the public square in front of it required some legal 
arrangements. As it is not legal to drink alcohol in public spaces in the centre of 
Bratislava, except on terraces of bars, the Alliance made an agreement with the 
municipality that allows the association to create a public space and assure its 
maintenance and cleaning every day; in exchange the municipality tolerates 
people consuming alcohol on the square. 
“As we started to revitalise this small square which is right in front of the 
old market hall we wanted be involved also further as it connects us with 
other communities in the city.” Veronika Hlinicanova 
In order to expand its impact on public spaces, the association began to work 
with various communities living in or using the area through events and focus 
groups, inquiring about their needs and barriers. The focus groups were followed 
by interviews with experts who gave their insights about the public spaces from 
the viewpoints of the green surfaces, mobility, lighting and other issues. Based 
on these inputs, the Alliance prepared a series of temporary interventions to 
make the spaces functional, lively and enjoyable. These events have all fed into 
the preparation of design competitions for the public spaces in the vicinity of the 
market hall. Besides the envisioned international design competition, the Alliance 
also plans to establish a new association with the participation of all the tenants 
of the market hall, with a focus on improving public spaces in the neighbouring 
area.   
“After two years, when the market hall began to be full of events, we 
understood that the impact of our events in the market is much smaller if 
the environment doesn’t change. Therefore, we moved our focus to the 
surrounding area and think about how to create added values through our 
spaces. This focus on surrounding public spaces became the second foot of 
the Old Market hall Alliance.” Gábor Bindics  
11 Impact 
“This constellation brings a direct benefit for the City, as it basically gets 
10.000 euros of new investment into the building every month. Another 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2

20 
 
benefit for the City is that we created space for seven new businesses 
inside the Market Hall, and several more entrepreneurs benefit from the 
building in a way or another.” Jan Mazur    
When the Old Market Hall Alliance was founded, the market hall’s area was 
relatively neglected, with many closed shops and dead facades. Bringing new 
activities into the market hall had a strong impact on its surroundings: there are 
much more people using the area, small commerce has been flourishing in the 
neighbouring streets and the bars that used to serve only elderly men have also 
become popular with young people.  
The Market Hall immediately enjoyed a high visibility and support: this is what 
enabled it to gain the approval of the City Council. This support was due to the 
founders’ credibility, reputation and track record: they were all trusted 
professionals known in the city. Social media, relatively fresh at the time of the 
market’s relaunch, were contributing to the high visibility of the Market Hall 
endeavour. In the same time, the need for a public venue organised in a 
different way was increasingly tangible: many services offered by the Market Hall 
were immediately embraced and used by the broader community.   
“The impact it has is that for many families going to the market has 
become a social activity, a fun activity, to be together and meet people 
which I think is very important. To create a social cohesion around food.” 
Illah van Oljen  
On a daily basis, the market hall accommodates about 90-100 people: that 
means a lot of workplaces, many of them new jobs that were born with the 
reopening of the building. In some cases, the market hall works as an incubator: 
a baker who rented a stall in the market later went on to open a bakery across 
the street. In others, the market, especially with its street food events, competes 
with other restaurants in the centre and takes away some of their clientele.  
“The market hall kicked off very quickly – as soon as we could equip the 
market hall, it was immediately populated with the market and other 
events. According to our calculations, around 40,000 people pass by the 
market hall every day. When the building was closed, it was perceived by 
people as a coulisse; once we opened it, people really enjoyed to have 
access to it and turned into a public space.” Gábor Bindics  
The Alliance, reassured about the positive effects of their intervention, went on 
to create proposals to the Municipality about how to develop, program, manage 
and administer the neighbouring areas and public spaces. In the meanwhile, the 
Alliance helped revitalising premises in the neighbouring streets, bringing in new 
tenants – shops for design, bikes and books – in the ground floor of a quite 
ruined building adjacent to the market hall.  
The market hall has brought social impact to the city in a variety of ways. The 
Alliance developed a tool to measure social impact in a monetary way. According 
to the association’s calculations beyond the 10,000 euros monthly revenue 
required to be invested in the building, another 16-20,000 euros could be earned 
with purely commercial activities: the difference can be conceived as the social 
investment amount within the building’s balance sheet.  
12 The model 
The model of Stara Trznica is constituted by the reuse of an abandoned or 
underused building by the means of transparent communication, cooperation 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766

between different professionals, multifunctional use with social benefits and the 
investment into the building deducted from the rental fee.  
The contract developed between the Old Market Hall Alliance and the Municipality 
has created a precedent that is seen as an example by other initiatives, including 
projects run by developers. The model was first reused in the vicinity of the 
Market Hall: the previous owner of a neighbouring, long-time vacant building 
invited the Alliance to implement the same model used in the market building: to 
invite tenants who do not need to pay a commercial rent and who can act as 
catalysts for the area or for the building. Here the Alliance developed a mixed 
function for the building, including offices in the upper floors and small 
bookstores and designer shops in the ground floor – but only part of it was 
realised before a new owner with a different vision took charge of the building.  
“In some buildings around the market, we used the same principles: 
tenants invested themselves in the reconstruction and that was deducted 
from their rent. But it was a model for us to move towards a kind of a niche 
development: if there is a building where you need to put strong social 
value, community value, not only economic value, we can provide this.” 
Jan Mazur  
On a broader scale, the Stara Trznica model has been hugely inspiring for a 
variety of other initiatives across Slovakia. Recognising the value of the Stara 
Trznica model, the Alliance has been supporting a variety of organisations to 
build up their models: they helped with advice the team regenerating the Rožno 
Monastery as well and initiators of Nova Cvernovka in Bratislava. The Alliance 
has also been involved in establishing Lucerna terrace in Prague as well as in the 
regeneration of the Cloister in Brno. These places have been also building a 
network based on the exchange of experiences.  
Politically, the model of the Old Market Hall serves as an example that proves 
that the civic-led management of publicly owned properties can be beneficial 
both to the municipality and the city’s communities: it is instrumental in 
convincing politicians and property owners to open up their buildings for civic 
uses. This model paved the way for several initiatives, from Nova Cvernovka in 
Bratislava to Kino Usmev in Kosice.  
“We don’t like being involved as advisors: once we leave a process and 
another team takes over, the risk that the overall concept changes and 
becomes too commercial is too high. It works better when we create a 
mechanism, find people who are active, build up a team and this team can 
organically lead the process and activate the building themselves: this is 
the key to success. Normally a municipality or an investor treats active 
people as a necessary bad thing that costs money. Instead, active people 
need to be part of the process from the beginning on as they can be the 
real engines of the transformation. Our role in this can be to accompany 
this process of negotiations.” Gábor Bindics

1 Summary of the project  
The  revitalization  project  of  the  Potocki  Palace,  a  Rococo  residence  in  a  county 
town  called  Radzyń Podlaski in eastern  Poland has  been  planned  since  2015. In 
2015, Radzyń City  Hall received the palace  from  the Polish  state.  The  fist 
renovation  works  after  the  handover  begun  in  2017. The municipality aims  to 
transform the palace into a cultural facility to attract tourists, integrate the local 
community, and  boost  the  cultural  and social  life  of  the  town  and  surrounding 
areas. Obtaining  funds  to  execute  a  feasible  and  sustainable  management  plan 
which can bolster the revitalization of the complex, remains a challenge. Likewise, 
establishing an appropriate governance model is the key issue to solve.

3 The History of the Potocki Palace 
The  Potocki  Palace  is  a  Rococo palace and  garden complex,  the  main  tourist 
attraction and  the  cultural  center in  a  county  town  called  Radzyń Podlaski  in 
eastern  Poland.  The  fifteenth-century  fortress  was  re-designed  as  a  Baroque 
residence,    which    received its 
present Rococo shape in the mid-
eighteenth century on the model of 
Louis    XIV’s    Versailles.    It    is 
surrounded  by  a  large  park  with 
artificial lakes ponds. In addition to 
the    architectural    and    artistic 
values,    the complex    has a 
historical significance: it played an 
essential  role  in  events  of  the 
following   centuries   as   a   social, 
administrative,  and  intellectual  center  of  the  region.  Since  its erection in  the 
fifteenth century, the entire building or some of its rooms have changed its function 
many  times:  fortress, aristocratic  residence,  school,  court  and  prison,  army 
headquarters, national archives, or a cultural center (Kowalik-Bylicka 2019). After 
1960s, the state kept the Palace in a fairly good physical state. However, despite 
its central location in the town, the palace complex has not been the meeting point 
for the community in Radzyń Podlaski. As the director of Lublin National Archives 
branch Radzyń Podlaski Joanna Kowalik-Bylicka pointed out: 
“If we look at the town <...> there is no main square, no space for residents to meet. 
The palace, therefore, is a perfect place to become a ‘center’ of the town. <...> It 
would be a perfect place to meet and socialize <...> It could also house some 
institutions, like NGOs.” (Kowalik-Bylicka 2019).

In  the  2000s, the  state  wanted  to  sell  the palace  to  a  private 
investor. However, the municipality opposed, as it would be against the will of the 
last private owners who donated it to the state treasury in 1920. They reserved 
that  the  palace  should  be  used  for  public  purposes.0F
1
 The  same  condition 
accompanied  the  municipality’s  handover  of  the  palace  from  the  national 
ownership, it has become a local public good (Wasak 2019c). 
On  July  2,  2015,  Radzyń  City  Hall received the  Potocki  Palace  from  the  Lublin 
Voivodeship authorities. The municipality aims to revitalize the palace, and turn it 
into  a significant cultural, educational,  and  social center. According  to  the 
municipality’s vision, the revitalization project should boost the citizens’ creativity, 
attract tourists, and make the region more attractive to potential investors (Wasak 
2019b, c). Revitalizing of the palace and its adaptation to new functions such as a 
modern museum and a community space should not only attract tourists but may 
also contribute to the return of Radzyń’s former inhabitants (who leave in pursuit 
of careers in bigger cities) by creating work opportunities and creating a tourist 
market (Wrana 2018, 43). 
To  protect the  palace  in  Radzyń  Podlaski  as  a  common  heritage  and a local 
historical treasure  accessible by  everyone,  City  Hall  insisted  upon  finding  a 
management concept which would benefit all citizens. Therefore, they refused to 
sell or lease any part of the palace complex to private enterprises.1F
2
 However, it 
has become the municipality’s responsibility to find funds for the renovation of the 
palace and to secure the operational costs. The estimated costs of the renovation 
are nearly seven million euros, and the town authorities cannot afford to fully cover 
it from the town’s budget. Since 2015 the municipality has been trying to obtain 
financial support from the Polish state and EU funds. In the meantime, valuable 
Johann Redler’s eighteen-century sculptures  and  the  palace’s  back  façade  have 
been renovated owing to a substantial grant from Polish Ministry of Culture and 
National Heritage (Wasak 2019c). 
Currently, there are four permanent and active institutions in the palace complex: 
a state music school, the Radzyń Music Society, the Cultural Centre of Radzyń, and 
the  tourist  information  center.  Occasionally,  the  building  is  used  for  public 
                                       
1
 The strife to prevent from selling the palace to a private owner was a part of the 2014 
and 2018 election campaigns of the current mayor Jerzy Rębek. He declared that the 
palace is a national treasure and it should belong to the society. He argues that if the 
palace is sold to a private investor, it will limit its accessibility. An average resident of the 
town will no longer benefit from the monument, which in fact, is the central and most 
impressive building it the area. (Wasak 2019b).

 According to Anna Wasak, the spokesperson of the Mayor of Radzyń Podlaski, there was 
a private entrepreneur willing to buy the palace and turn it into a hotel. The public 
opinion was against it, because the residents thought that the intention of the 
entrepreneur was to restrict public access to the palace complex. Around 1,500 citizens 
(that is c. 10 percent of the entire population of Radzyn) signed a petition against selling 
the palace to private owners. Therefore, the municipality rejected the deal (Wasak 
2019b). Katarzyna Krupska-Grudzień, a founder of the Local Group of Action “Zapiecek”, 
believes that the municipality presented the situation to the locals in a somewhat 
simplified way: that the Palace can either be sold to a private owner who would limit 
access for the public, or to keep it in public ownership. Krupska-Grudzień thinks that it is 
unfortunate that no other alternatives were considered and presented to the residents of 
the town (Krupska-Grudzień 2019a).

performances and  exhibitions. However,  the  palace’s  premises 
are usually not accessible by external visitors. 
Obtaining funds to execute a feasible and sustainable management plan which can 
bolster   the   revitalization   of   the   complex,   remains   a   challenge.   Likewise, 
establishing an appropriate governance model is the key issue to solve. Without it 
the heritage might be misused or damaged and will keep producing costs instead 
of generating profit. Moreover, the residents may lose the last thread of emotional 
attachment to the palace. The monument is too important on the regional scale to 
mishandle  the  opportunity  to  renovate  it and  use  as  a  source  of  social 
empowerment and economic revitalization. 
4 Context and infrastructure 
Radzyń Podlaski is a middle-sized town located near the Białka River in the Lublin 
voivodeship. It covers an area of 19 square kilometers. Radzyń Podlaski is located 
145 kilometers from Warsaw and 73 kilometers from Lublin; it is the capital of the 
voivodeship.  A  few  critical  communication  routes  intersect  in  Radzyń  Podlaski: 
national  road  19  constituting  the  European  transport  corridor  leading  from  the 
Baltic countries towards Slovakia and national road 63 crossing Poland from the 
border with Belarus in the east and with Kaliningrad Oblast’ (Russia) in the north.2F

Radzyń  Podlaski  has  16,400  residents  (2018)  and  a fairly developed  social 
infrastructure:  it  has  four  kindergartens,  three  primary  schools,  three  junior 
secondary schools, two high schools, six vocational schools, one high school for 
adults, and one  public  music  school.  Although  there  are  no  higher  educational 
institutions, 11 percent of residents hold a higher education diploma (Cwik 2018, 
3). In 2018, the town had 16 artistic groups, nine cultural centers and clubs, which 
altogether  organized  190  cultural  events  (Table 1). There  is  no  museum  in  the

 Radzyń City Hall sees the possible connection of the revitalization of Potocki Palace with 
another ambitious infrastructural project, the establishment of “Via Carpathia,” a 
transnational highway network connecting Klaipėda in Lithuania with Thessaloniki in 
Greece. It is currently planned to open in 2025. Radzyń Podlaski authorities consider the 
road, which will cross the town, as a significant investment for the local economic 
advancement.

The infrastructure of the hospitality industry is poorly developed. Radzyń is not a 
tourist destination yet, hence, investing in this specific type of infrastructure has 
not been a priority nor a need for the local authorities and entrepreneurs.3F

 There 
are three bed and breakfast facilities in Radzyń Podlaski. The majority of tourists 
stay for one night. There are a few restaurants. As Katarzyna Krupska-Grudzień, 
founder of the Local Group of Action “Zapiecek” (and a resident of Radzyń) pointed 
out,  “tourists  cannot  spend  money  in Radzyń Podlaski  even  if  they  want  to” 
(Krupska-Grudzień 2019a). 
Working age population constitutes 66 percent of the town’s population, and post-
working age is 16 percent (Central Statistical Office 2019).  
The main manufacturing employers in the town are a large dairy factory, a factory 
which produces mining tools, a factory of medical appliances, a confectionery, and 
a fruit processing factory. Most of the employable population works in the service 
sector. Joanna Kowalik-Bylicka noted that “in the past, people used to joke that in 
Radzyń you can only work in administration or in the hospital.” She thinks that the 
situation is changing now, and the labor market is getting more diverse. However, 
in Kowalik-Bylicka’s opinion, a lot still has to be done “to make young people stay 
[in Radzyń]” (Kowalik-Bylicka 2019).

 Radzyń Podlaski county has a great potential to develop tourism, especially heritage tourism and academic 
tourism. Every year since 2017, a small village Sobole, 16 kilometers from Radzyń, hosts the prestigious 
international Holis summer school. In 2018 it had 24 participants, in 2019 already 45 participants from all around 
the world.

5 Description of the Complex 
The  Potocki Palace  complex  is  a  large 
(c. 44,000     square     meter)     Rococo 
residence,  with  four  water  ponds  and  a 
courtyard  in  the  front,  and  an  Italian 
style  strolling  garden  at  the back.  The 
complex includes a  Rococo  orangery, 
which  is probably the  best-preserved 
building  of  this  kind  in  Poland.  By  the 
time of the handover from the district to 
municipal authorities (2015), the palace 
was in a dire state. A turbulent history of 
the building resulted in decaying façades, 
a crumbled  courtyard,  and  utterly  desecrated 
interiors. 
Radzyń Podlaski began to develop already in the 
fifteenth   century   when   it   was   strategically 
situated on a trail between Kraków and Vilnius. 
In   the   late   seventeenth   century, architect 
August Locci rebuilt the castle into a palazzo in 
Fortezza type residence. In the period between 
1749 and 1759, the building’s owner Eustachy 
Potocki  commissioned a royal  architect  Jakub 
Fontana to reconstruct the palace into a Rococo 
mansion. Johann Chrisostomus Redler, perhaps 
the  most  prominent Austrian Rococo  sculptor, 
created the sculptural decoration of the palace. 
This  shape  of  the  building  has  been  preserved 
until  now. The  subsequent  owners  continued  to  develop  the  palace. Over  the 
centuries, Radzyń palace was the most noticeable and the largest building in the 
town,  the  prestige  of  which grew  thanks  to the  complex.  However,  in  the 
nineteenth century, the importance of the palace complex declined (Wrana 2018, 
45). 
In  1920, Bronisław  Korwin  Szlubowski,  the  last  private  owner  of  the  palace, 
donated the palace complex to the state treasury (Kowalik-Bylicka 2019). Since 
then, the palace has been adapted to many purposes, such as a shelter for war 
veterans or later, state administration offices. In the first half of the 1940s, the 
building was occupied by Nazi Germans, who put it on fire in June 1944. The entire 
original  Rococo  interior  furnishing  and  decoration  perished  in flames (Wasak 
2019c). The first reconstruction of the palace began in 1950 and was finished in 
1960  when  the  town  transformed  it  to  serve  administrative  purposes again. 
Reconstruction works included only the façade, while the interiors were readjusted 
according to the contemporary fashion. Since then the palace has accommodated 
the regional court, a branch of the national archives, a music school, and several 
state administrative offices.

The  state  kept  the palace  in a good 
technical  condition.  However,  it  was  not  inclined  to 
develop the palace’s potential as public space (Wrana 
2018,  45).  In  July  2015,  the  state  handed  the 
residence over to Radzyń Podlaski City Hall. The mayor 
of Radzyń Podlaski announced that as the new owner 
of the palace, the City Hall would ensure that the large 
historical building is utilized only for the common good 
of the community (Wasak 2019b). 
Now the palace is in a relatively good technical shape. 
Its foundations were fortified, a new copper roof was 
laid, the facades are intact, and it is heated in winter 
(Wasak   2019c).   However,   there   is   no   interior 
decoration in the building. 
The   site   does   not   have   regular   opening   hours. 
Nevertheless, there is moderate traffic of tourists. The 
tourist information office,  which  is  located on  the 
premises of the palace, welcomes around ten visitors per day. Most visitors come 
between April and September. People arrive from the neighboring  counties, the 
more distant regions of Poland, as well as from abroad (Kulpa 2019).

6 Heritage values  
The  name  “Potocki Palace” refers  to an  entire  building  complex  of  a  rococo 
residence  and  its  park.  The  complex  represents  the  French  type entre  cour  et 
jardin, which means “between the courtyard and the garden,” the most recognized 
example  of  which is in  Versailles. The 
Potocki Palace belongs to the short list of 
only ten building complexes of this kind in 
Europe. It is one of the most valuable built 
heritage sites in eastern Poland, which has 
been  compared  to  such monuments as 
Versailles, the Zwinger in  Dresden, the 
Sanssouci  in Potsdam, and  the Branicki 
Palace in Białystok (Cwik 2018, 28-30). 
Due to the rich history of the palace, there 
are  also  a  few practices  which  count  as 
intangible  cultural  heritage connected  to 
the site. the most  prominent  pre-Chopin 
era composer – Karol Józef Lipiński – was 
born  in  this  palace. Today, the palace 
hosts a state music  school  named  after 
Lipiński. There is a Karol Lipiński society 
which every  year organizes the  Days  of 
Karol  Lipiński – an  event which attracts 
many renowned musicians. The accordion 
orchestra “Arti    Sentemo”    performs 
successfully in Poland and abroad (Wasak 
2019c). 
7 Adaptive Reuse 
Currently,  there  are four  institutions active in  the palace  complex: the  Cultural 
Centre of Radzyń Podlaski (in the Orangery building4F

), the music school, Radzyń 
Music Society, and the Tourist Information Point.

 The construction of the Orangery was finished by 1759. It was still used as an orangery 
before the nationalization of the palace complex in 1920 (Wasak 2019b).

The  main  building  of  the  palace  is 
closed  (except  for  the  part  which  hosts  the  music 
school  and  the Radzyń  Music  Society). However, 
occasionally, it  is  used  for exhibitions  and  other 
cultural events.5F

 There is no full-time personnel to 
open  the  palace  and  guide tourists, hence only 
appointed visitors can get in. They can find a phone 
number  of the Mayor’s spokesperson  Anna  Wasak 
on  the  website  of the  palace (palac-potockich.pl), 
and she can let them in (Wasak 2019b). The interior 
has not been adapted to mass visits yet. 
Two professionals can do guided 
tours  by  demand;  visitors  can 
book them via the   Tourist 
Information Point.  The  visitors 
can get some information there 
or   use   a   mobile   application 
“Spacerem po Radzyniu 
Podlaskim” [Walking  through  Radzyń  Podlaski] launched in 
September 2018. This application offers an audio guided tour 
(in Polish) around the town, including the Potocki Palace and 
the park (Niewęgłowski 2018). 
Most    events    and 
exhibitions take place 
in the Orangery 
building, occupied by the Cultural Centre 
of Radzyń Podlaski. This center organizes 
most cultural events in the town, such as 
musical   performances   and fine   arts 
exhibitions.6F

 The  Orangey  has  a  cinema 
hall  which  can  host  around  250  people 
and   where   medium-size   events   are 
organized. Apart from projecting movies, 
the    cinema    hall    welcomes    musical 
performances,  theatre  plays,  and other 
public cultural events.

 In July 2019 there were three photo exhibitions organized by The Radzyń photography 
club “Klatka [Frame]”. URL: https://pl-pl.facebook.com/rkfklatka/

 In Katarzyna Krupska-Grudzień’s opinion, the Orangery is not attractive for young 
people. There is a need for a new cultural center which is modern, attractive for the 
youngsters, and disabled friendly (Krupska-Grudzień 2019a).

There  is  an  art  gallery  in  the  cellar  of  the Orangery  where  the  Cultural  Center 
organizes exhibitions. On average, every two weeks a new artist presents in the 
gallery (Wasak 2019c). The residents are welcome to approach the administration 
of the Cultural Center with their initiative and organize events in cooperation with 
the municipality (Wasak 2019b).

The park of   the palace   complex   is 
permanently   open. People   use   it as 
recreation space, for walking and cycling. 
It   is   also   used to   organize outdoor 
cultural activities, mostly by the Cultural 
Centre  of  Radzyń  Podlaski. On  the rear 
side of the main body, there is a summer 
stage where local  artists  present  their 
work every  Sunday:  they  sing, play 
music,  theatre  groups  perform.  Every 
Thursday, there is a screening of a movie 
which residents choose before the event

The Potocki Palace in Radzyń Podlaski

During the past few years, the   Cultural   Center   and   the 
municipality  organized various  events 
such as the Oranżeria: Polish Encounters 
with     Original     Polish     Songs,     the 
Rockowisko Guitar    Workshops,    the 
Kolędobranie Christmas  carols festival, 
or/and an international theatre workshop 
Dialogi. In  July  2017 the  municipality 
organized a  unique  competition  called 
Palace  Game  Jam.  Contestants  from  all 
over Poland came  together  to  design  a 
computer  game  within 48 hours  on  a 
topic  announced  right  before  the  timer 
started. Many events  are  financed  by 
external commercial sponsors like big manufacturing companies or banks, or by 
local authorities like Radzyń City Hall and the head of the county (Wasak 2019b). 
On September 1, 2019 the municipality announce new plans for creating the 
“Museum of Sarmatian Culture” with the support of Ministry of Culture and 
National Heritage (Wasak 2019d). No details about the project been revealed 
yet. 
The Radzyń Cultural Center organizes around 20 to 30 events per year. Usually, 
these  are  concerts  or  performances, two or three picnics,  local crafts fairs,  and 
movie screenings. The fairs usually precede holidays, Christmas and Easter, they 
are outdoors – even in winter, unless weather conditions are unfavorable and the 
fair is  shifted to  the palace (Kulpa  2019). The  abovementioned  events  find  it 
relatively easy to use building complex originally constructed for other purposes, 
perhaps, because the palace used to be the center of the cultural and social life in 
Radzyń for a long time. 
Jakub Jakubowski, the resident of Radzyń Podlaski and the owner of the art cafe 
Kofi & Ti:  
“The palace is a big building; there is much space for everybody. Moreover, it would 
be enough space not only for all active people from Radzyń Podlaski but also for people 
from outside. They should have an opportunity to come here and show their art, open 
exhibitions,  organize  public  performances.  We  should  think  big; we  should  engage 
people  into  working  on  the [revitalization] project  together  so that  we  can  use  the 
palace in the future for our common good” (Jakubowski 2019). 
8 Development plan 
The first meeting of the “revitalization team” took place on August 20, 2015. The 
meeting was inclusive, and fifty people – Radzyń Podlaski residents – came. The 
Mayor promised  to  design  a revitalization concept  within two months  from  the 
meeting (Wasak  2015). Later Radzyń  City  Hall presented  the  plan for the 
revitalization of the Potocki Palace in several interrelated documents: 
The 2009-20 Radzyń Podlaski Local Development Strategy was prepared by 
the “Local Initiatives Support Agency (Agencja Wspierania Inicjatyw Lokalnych)”

and  adopted  by  City  Hall  in  2009. The  document  presents  the 
analysis of economic, social and cultural infrastructure of the town as well as the 
strategy of its development. The document positions the Potocki palace complex 
as a local resource for cultural development of the town (Cwik 2018, 36). 
The  2016-23  Radzyń  Podlaski  Urban  Revitalization  Programme.  The 
document  was  prepared  by  a  team  of  specialists  from  various  disciplines  and 
companies  under  the  leadership  of  Piotr  Janczarek  from “Lublin  Foundation  of 
Ecological Initiatives (Lubelska Fundacja Inicjatyw Ekologicznych).” The Orangery, 
the  main  market  square  situated  next  to  the  Potocki  Palace,  the  Potocki  Palace 
with its courtyard, and the historical strolling garden at the back of the palace, are 
among the subjects of the major revitalization plans (Janczarek et al. 2017, 194-
206). 
Radzyń City Hall engaged different experts to the planning process of the palace’s 
development. In summer 2017, Dr. Michał Kapczyński from the Academy of Fine 
Arts in Warsaw prepared “A Sketch of the Concept of the Adaptation of the Potocki 
Palace  in  Radzyń Podlaski to  Serve  Cultural  and  Social  Needs  (Szkic  koncepcji 
adaptacji Pałacu Potocki w Radzyniu na potrzeby kulturalne i społeczne).” Later in 
the same year, a team from the Lublin University of Technology was engaged in 
creating a design which  would  be  based  on  the  previously  submitted  concept 
(Wrana 2018, 46). Jan Wrana, a head of the team from the Lublin University of 
Technology, explained the purpose of the project in the following way:  
“A  modern,  multidisciplinary  center  bringing  together  several  functions:  a  museum 
with  the  preserved  historical  interior,  historical  photography  and  classical  films  lab, 
senior people’s club,  cafe, youth  organizations headquarter and  the  Polish  Scouting 
Association [ZHP]. It is a place for meetings and activity but also a place for cherishing 
the memory of the multicultural nature of this region of Poland” (Wrana 2018, 46). 
The  Revitalization  Programme (2016-23) set  up  three  strategic  goals.  The  first 
goal  of  the  town’s  center  revitalization  is  to  foster  social  engagement  of  the 
residents  and  to  integrate  the  local  community.  The  second  goal  is  to  create 
favorable conditions for the economic development of the town. The third goal is 
to create a modern public space in the center of the town in order to improve the 
quality of life of the residents and to enhance livability of the town (Cwik 2018, 
34). 
According to the development plan (Figure 16), the central part of the palace 
shall be kept in a style close to the original. The space on the first floor will be 
dedicated to exhibitions and conferences. A café with a music corner, cloakroom, 
and toilets will be located on the ground floor in the former concert hall. An 
entrance to the café will lead through a terrace which will face the rear strolling 
garden. The western part of the main body will be entirely dedicated to 
multimedia: photography and film labs, a sound production studio, a photo 
gallery, and a cinema. All the creative work rooms are envisioned to provide 
professional facilities for visual and IT education through extracurricular activities 
for the youth, public workshops, and special events. Both floors of the eastern 
part of the main body will play important roles. The first floor – with a chess 
studio, fine arts studio, and a computer lab – will be designed for the youth. The 
ground floor with a “senior’s club” and a “room of the senior’s creative work” will 
attract the elderly members of the community. The national archives will occupy

the west wing of the palace. The eastern wing, which until now 
has hosted a public elementary music school and a public library, will be entirely 
dedicated to the music school. The management plan includes all necessary 
accessibility aids as well as modern maintenance systems. The building will be 
adjusted to the needs of citizens with physical disabilities (Wasak 2017, 2018, 
2019c). It seems like the ideas on how to use space in the revitalized palace 
were invented by the municipality rather then come from the public discussions. 
 
Figure 17 The management plan of the Potocki palace's main wing, ground floor (Wasak 2017). 
Anna Wasak explains that the municipality will offer place in the renovated palace 
to people and organizations “who are already running some activities.” She adds 
that “the essence of the activities [in the revitalized palace] will not change, it is 
only  the  aesthetics  and  architectural  assets  of  the  surroundings  that  will be 
transformed. It will be even better, even more beautiful [for the clubs to work in 
the palace].” (Wasak 2019c). 
However, not all residents of the town agree with this plan. Katarzyna Krupska-
Grudzień believes that if the town allows only cultural institutions in the renovated 
palace, it “will not take advantage of the added value of its historical importance.” 
In her opinion, the archives, the seniors’ club, or the music school “can find their 
place in any other modern! building”. Krupska-Grudzień thinks that in addition to 
the  cultural  institutions,  the  palace  can  host  a  conference  center  with  a  high-
standard hotel nearby. She explains: “I think it would be more in the direction of 
using the palace as a beautiful building of a high artistic value” (Krupska-Grudzień 
2019b). 
Anna  Wasak  acknowledges  that  the  municipality  did  not  engage  experts  with 
economic or business background. The Lublin University of Technology developed 
the technical part of the project. The concept was developed by the Academy of 
Fine  Arts in Warsaw. However, there is no business plan for the palace (Wasak 
2019c). 
Development  plane. The  municipality  sticks  to  a  “path  dependence” 
principle. The Mayor believes that the adaptive reuse of the revitalized palace 
should  be  based  on  the  current  trend,  but  in  a  larger  scale.  An  alternative 
approach would be to take a riskier role of a leading innovator and to apply 
some  disruptive conceptual  and managerial  approaches  which  will  bring  a 
“Bilbao effect” (The Economist 2018).

9 Actors 
The owner of the palace and the decision-maker is Radzyń City Hall. The current 
Mayor Jerzy Rębek and his spokesperson Anna Wasak have particularly prominent 
roles.  They  make  the  strategic  decisions,  communicate  them  personally  to  the 
public, and outsource preparing project proposals. The municipality commissioned 
some institutions to  develop  the project, such  as The  Lublin  University  of 
Technology and The Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. 
Radzyń City Hall supervises the Cultural Centre of Radzyń Podlaski (located in the 
Orangery). The center organizes most of the cultural events in the palace premises 
and beyond. 
All significant reconstructions of the palace should be coordinated with the Lublin 
Voivodeship  Monument  Conservation Conservator  or  Conservation  Office.  The 
organization approves the projects of monument reconstruction. 
The  Lublin  Voivodeship  Marshal's  office  distributes  resources  from  the  Regional 
Operational Programme allotted to the Lublin Voivodeship by the European Union 
through the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. 
The  relationship  with  the  previous  marshal  was  characterized  by  conflicts. 
However, the current marshal (Jarosław Stawiarski) is more cooperative in relation 
to the current City Hall which represents the same political fraction (Wasak 2019a). 
The municipality claims that they engaged the local civic organizations to discuss 
the project. Anna Wasak says that the town authorities invited local public opinion 
to  express  concerns and share suggestions regarding  the palace’s revitalization 
project through a specially designated “team.” Wasak emphasizes: “Every citizen 
could submit his or her suggestion. Some were submitted on behalf of certain civic 
societies and associations <...> Social consultations did take place, and the authors 
of the project did consider the results.” (Wasak 2019c) 
However,  some  socially engaged residents  believe  that  their  opinion  (especially 
that from out-groups7F
8
) was not considered. Some of our interviewees pointed out 
that  the  municipality  should  have had chosen  independent  experts.  Katarzyna 
Krupska-Grudzień  thinks  that  the  consultations  with  the  community  were  not 
enough. She thinks that many qualified residents would be happy to be involved 
in the management, if they had been invited (Krupska-Grudzień 2019a). 
Katarzyna Krupska-Grudzień doubts that the town alone has enough capacity to 
implement   the   project.   Radzyń   Podlaski   has   around   50   registered   civic 
organizations, and about 15 are active (Krupska-Grudzień 2019a). However, none 
of them is strong enough “to take responsibility to manage the palace by its own.” 
Krupska-Grudzień also thinks that engaging independent experts can broaden the 
perspective of the decision-making team: “And an outsider can have a fresh look 
<...> A discussion, a debate would be the best solution. Each of us has different 
opinions,  emotions,  views,  experience, and that  is  why we would  also  need  an

 Out-group members refers to those individuals in a group or an organization who do 
not identify themselves as part of the larger group. They are individuals who are 
disconnected and not fully engaged in working toward the goals of the group (Northouse 
2017, 351).

outsider with a fresh perspective, and together we could come up 
with innovatory ideas.” (Krupska-Grudzień 2019b). 
During the interview, Katarzyna Krupska-Grudzień raised an important question 
of the heritage ownership. She said that “the region is the real community for 
the palace, not just the town <...> It is a national asset; there should be national 
level consultations.” (Krupska-Grudzień 2019a). 
Leadership and inclusion. The municipality encouraged the local community 
to share their vision of the palace’s future. It contacted experts to develop the 
technical plan. The position of the towns’ leadership is that the best experts 
are  those  who  know  the  most  about  the  palace  and  the  society  of  Radzyń 
Podlaski. They claim to know “what people want” and act accordingly to their 
best knowledge. The lack of an outsider’s perspective is the main flaw of this 
approach.  More  out-group  members  among  Radzyń  residents  as  well  as 
outsiders   could   be   engaged   in   the   decision-making.   The   municipality 
emphasizes  that  the  palace  is  not  only  Radzyń  Podlaski’s,  but  a  national 
heritage  asset.  Therefore,  people  from  outside  the  town  should  also  be 
involved in decision-making and creating the future of the palace. 
10 Communications 
Concerning the revitalization project, the decision-makers communicate with the 
public via websites, social media, and the local newspaper. 
The palace’s website (palac-potockich.pl) offers  some  general information about 
the history and historical and artistic value of the palace, as well as shares news 
about events. There is no special social media page of the palace, but the Radzyń 
Cultural  Center has  a  website  (rokradzyn.pl)  and a  Facebook  page @rokradzyn 
where materials about the cultural life around the palace are shared. The center 
also     runs a website (kochamradzyn.pl)     and a Facebook     page 
@kochamradzynpodlaski “Kocham Radzyń Podlaski” [I love Radzyń Podlaski] with 
4,460  followers, which  updates its  followers about  the  cultural repertoir  in  the 
town. It is via this Facebook page where residents can choose a movie to watch 
on the following Thursday at the outdoor cinema in the palace’s courtyard. 
City Hall is obliged to publish all updates related to development of the 
revitalization project online via its website (radzyn-podl.pl) as well as in a printed 
version as “Biuletyn Informacyjny Miasta Radzyń.” The only social media 
platform run by City Hall is again a Facebook page @UrzadMiastaRadzynPodlaski.  
The   Tourist Information Point which 
belongs to  the  county  administration, 
runs    a website    “Radzyńska    Kraina 
Sedeczności” (krainaserdecznosci.pl). 
which offers some information about the 
palace in  Polish,  English,  and  Russian. 
The  point  is  located  on  the  palace’s 
premises  and  is  open  for tourists  daily.

11 Values and identity  
The  historical  narrative  of  the  town  is  built  around  the palace and its image 
represents the town in all mass media (Figure 14). The municipality emphasizes 
the importance  of  the palace on a national  scale, which legitimizes Radzyń 
Podlaski’s  ambition  to  be  the  cultural capital of  the  region.  As  Anna  Wasak 
underlined, “...the palace used to be important not only for Radzyń county or Lublin 
voivodeship, or even for Poland...  Radzyń was a  significant point  on  the  cultural 
map of Europe.” (Wasak 2019c). 
 
Figure 19 A fragment of the Radzyń municipality homepage (https://www.radzyn-podl.pl/) 
Katarzyna Krupska-Grudzień also agrees that the palace plays a crucial role in the 
life  and  identity  of  the  residents:  “...the palace is  a  part  of  us,  the  citizens  of 
Radzyń. It has been here since we were born, so it has always been present in our 
lives.” (Krupska-Grudzień 2019b). Another interviewee, Jakub Jakubowski agrees 
in principle about the importance of the palace; however, he pointed out that some 
residents still struggle with accepting the idea of the palace as their own asset:  
“Over decades, people treated this place as something they do not possess. It was the 
palace of aristocrats and the state representatives. The poor people who lived around 
looked at that important person and thought that they could only serve by his table. 
And some people still think this way, so we need to change this. In order to change 
this  attitude,  people  should  be  more  engaged  in  the  process  of the palace 
revitalization.” (Jakubowski 2019). 
12 Protection of Heritage  
The Potocki palace has a status of the national monument. In 2016 Radzyń City 
Hall applied to the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage to recognize the 
palace as a Monument of History, the highest status of a heritage object in 

H2020 PROJECT

Poland.

 The application was accepted, but no decisions have 
been announced by July 2019.  
Current  owners  have  taken  steps  which  would  grant  the  status  of  the  highest 
national monument protection, known as the Monument of History status, to the 
palace. The idea, however, may lead to controversies. On one hand, it can provide 
a new opportunity of public resources for the restoration of the palace complex. 
On the other hand, the status implies more restrains on spatial and compositional 
changes  of  the  palace  complex.  Therefore,  it  can  be  more  difficult  to introduce 
innovative ideas for the utilization of the palace’s rooms (Cwik 2018, 46). 
13 Financial plan  
The estimated costs for the revitalization of the palace is c. 25 million PLN, that is 
5.7 million € (Burda 2019a). This includes renovation costs of the palace’s interiors 
and of the park complex. Since the beginning of the project, Radzyń City Hall has 
been struggling to obtain financial resources for the revitalization of the palace. It 
aimed at obtaining funds from  the state budget. In April 2018, Radzyń City  Hall 
received  1.6 million  PLN,  that  is  c.  375,000 €, for the renovation  works of  the 
building’s western façade and 25,400 PLN, that is c. 6,000 €, to renovate one of 
the Redler’s statues (Cwik 2018, 51). Later, the same year, City Hall applied for 
another 10  million  PLN (c. 4.6 million euros),  which  was  supposed  to  cover  the 
rest of the revitalization. The application was rejected with an option to resubmit. 
However, the Mayor withdrew the application. In 2019, Radzyń City Hall applied 
for 20 million PLN (4.6 million euros) and in September 2019 received confirmation 
about 22 million PLN grant for developing revitalizing the palace and establishing 
“Museum of Sarmatian Culture” (Wasak 2019d). The rest of the will be covered 
from the town’s budget (Wasak 2019b).  
Applying for  state  funding  seems  reasonable, as the  primary  source  of  the 
monument  protection  funding  in  Poland  is  the  state  budget which distributes 
allocated   resources directly   from the   national   treasury   or   through   local 
governments (Cwik 2018, 47). However, the municipality could have considered 
seeking funds from other sources as well, like crowdfunding. 
Radzyń City Hall has no intention to turn the revitalized palace into a self-financing 
institution. There is no plan to have any for-profit entities in the palace complex. 
The café on the ground floor is supposed to generate revenue (even though there 
is no clear business plan for this enterprise either). The municipality’s position is 
that the Potocki   Palace   should “serve the public   good”,   which   in   their 
understanding is equivalent to “provide services for free”. It should provide space 
to the archives, music school, host cultural events and educational activities. The 
town’s budget should  cover  the operational  and  maintenance costs. Therefore, 
Radzyń  City  Hall does not  consider activities  for-profit (Wasak  2019b). The 
principle of the town’s authorities is that the palace “cannot be used for commercial 
purposes; it cannot be for-profit” (Wasak 2019c). Anna Wasak explains that the

 This status refers only to non-movable monuments and is granted by the President of the Republic of Poland after 
a motion of the Minister of Culture and National Heritage.

municipality   expects   that   the palace will be economically 
benefiting in an indirect way: 
“I think that the palace by itself will not bring big profits <...> It is not about earning 
money by us as City Hall, but maybe it will foster the promotion and development of 
the town. [Radzyń] is a small town with small industry, so we are looking for sources 
of revenue for the residents to keep people in the town or maybe encourage someone 
to  come  back.  But  [the revitalization  of  the Palace]  will  serve  for  the  general 
development of the town, not only for City Hall, not only for the town’s budget but for 
all citizens.” (Wasak 2019c). 
The municipality expects that the state will indirectly cover most of the operational 
costs of the palace. The Ministry of Culture and National Heritage is in charge of 
the music  school  and  the  National Archives; hence, the rent  they  pay  means  a 
permanent  and  stable income  in  the  future (Wasak  2019b). Currently,  local 
businesses, such  as  the  dairy  factory “SM  Spomlek” or  banks (so mostly  large 
enterprises), financially support many cultural events in the palace complex. The 
municipality counts on their contribution in the future as well (Wasak 2019b) but 
it seems they do not try to reach out to smaller-scale enterprises. 
Some interviewees think that there are better management models, alternative to 
the  Mayor’s  project. Katarzyna  Krupska-Grudzień  believes  that  the  current 
management concept is not economically sustainable. She thinks that the palace 
“is too big; the town cannot afford it.” Moreover, the current municipal leadership 
is not competent enough to design and execute an economically sustainable model 
(Krupska-Grudzień  2019a). She  believes  that experts  in  social  entrepreneurship 
should manage the palace:  
“My vision is that an object like this palace is economically balanced and that the town 
does not have to contribute to its maintenance with money, because this is the money 
of all of the citizens. I believe the palace should be handed over to people from the 
world of business or people from NGOs, or big European institutions, who are able to 
come up  with a  financially  sustainable  idea  and can obtain  finances to  pursue their 
activities, which will bring revenue.” (Krupska-Grudzień 2019b). 
Jakub  Jakubowski,  who  owns  art  cafe Kofi  &  Ti and has a vast experience  in 
organizing cultural events in the town, agrees that at least a part of the palace 
could be managed by a private business. In Jakubowski’s opinion, half of the palace 
could be turned into a conference hall and a hotel, which could generate revenue 
to secure funds for the cultural initiatives hosted by the other (publicly-managed) 
half of the palace (Jakubowski 2019). 
Business  model. The  municipality  chose  the  model  which  prioritizes  public 
goods  versus  economic  sustainability  and  does  not  consider  economic  and 
ownership diversification. The principal position of the owner and the decision-
maker is that the site should be a public good, it should not generate profit, 
but instead, the town should cover all expenses from its budget. An alternative 
solution  might  be  pursuing  an  economically  sustainable  model.  “Non-profit” 
status  does  not  mean  that  the  organization  should  not  generate  any  profit 
which otherwise can be used to cover the operational costs. Moreover, creating 
a long-term cash flow can enable developing new projects for the public good. 
Revenues can be tied to socially-oriented goals.

14 General recommendations and 
conclusions 
Based on the analysis of the case, we suggest two steps: 
1. Inviting independent experts in social entrepreneurship to develop a business 
plan of economically sustainable development of the palace’s revitalization 
project. 
2. Applying an inclusive approach towards the out-group members. The municipal 
leaders should listen to out-group members, recognize their unique contributions, 
help them become included, give them a voice, and empower them to act. True 
empowerment  requires  that  the  leaders  relinquish  some  control,  giving more 
control to out-group members. 
The  town  of  Radzyń  Podlaski  boasts  a rich  history  and  unique  cultural  heritage. 
The revitalization process of its preeminent monument, the Potocki Palace, is an 
excellent opportunity to create platforms to promote the local heritage and build a 
long-term strategy with a clear vision of the effects of the town’s transformations.

Executive summary 
ExRotaprint was founded in 2007 by tenants of the former Rotaprint industrial 
complex located in Wedding, a traditional working-class district in central Berlin. 
ExRotaprint set up a legal configuration comprising a heritable building right and 
non-profit status in order to buy the complex put up for sale by the Berlin 
Municipality's Real Estate Fund. Established by the tenants ExRotaprint became 
owner of the 10,000 m2 complex and started a non-profit real estate 
development project setting a precedent in Berlin that inspired many 
experiments in cooperative ownership and a campaign to change the city's 
privatisation policy. ExRotaprint offers affordable rents to small businesses, 
artists and social projects.

2 The story of the building complex 
ExRotaprint is located on the former site of the Rotaprint printing machine 
manufacturer, a German company that operated in Berlin-Wedding for 80 years

and gave employment to many families in the area. Rotaprint significantly 
shaped the area and its society: it hired the compound’s architect to build its 
production facilities, later expanded the complex, had some guest apartments in 
the vicinity, and a workers' holiday home in Berlin-Wannsee. The complex was 
largely destroyed during the Second World War but it was reconstructed in the 
post-war years following the design of the architect Klaus Kirsten. The factory 
produced small printing machines and was very successful until electronic 
technology began to threaten the small-format offset printer. In 1989 the 
Rotaprint company went bankrupt. Because of outstanding debts, ownership of 
the complex was transferred over to the City of Berlin. 
Since the 1990s, the Wedding district administration rented the empty spaces of 
the Rotaprint compound to temporary occupants: small businesses and artists 
moved in the complex, occupying half of the site. In 2002, the property was 
transferred to the assets of the Liegenschaftsfonds GmbH (Real Estate Fund), a 
trustee of the State of Berlin to sell it at the biggest possible price. At the time, 
the City of Berlin was trying to recover from debt by selling packages of its 
buildings.  
“We felt that the spirit of Rotaprint was still here, this is why we named 
the compound ExRotaprint. It is also to honour the achievement because 
we think they left fantastic buildings." Daniela Brahm

3 The policy context  
The Rotaprint complex was public property: it belonged to the Berlin state that 
rented it out for short term uses for artists, manufacturers and other activities, 
mostly from the neighbourhood.  In 2001, the city’s real estate policy changed: 
selling off properties in order to balance the municipal budget became the 
priority, and the city created a new in-house company, the Liegenschaftsfonds 
(German for Property Funds), to orchestrate the privatisation process. The 
activities of the Liegenschaftsfonds, selling out public properties, was seen with 
an increasing criticism that saw an irreversible damage happening to the city. 
The city’s policy of prioritising privatisation was rooted in Berlin’s banking scandal 
where Berlin accumulated a large amount of debt: the bailout of the 
Bankgesellschaft costed the city over 30 billion euros. Therefore, Berlin’s policy 
priority from the mid-1990s on was to keep a balanced budget. On one hand, 
this fiscal policy had a heavy impact on the city’s welfare services: the public 
budget cuts made a significant pressure on wages in the public sector and 
reduced the resources of many public facilities like schools, hospitals and 
kindergartens. This also meant that Berlin was facing a situation that many cities 
only encountered years later: “The transition to ‘austerity urbanism' in Berlin did 
not have to wait for a global financial crisis.” (Bernt et al 2013:17) On the other 
hand, fiscal austerity also implied a major privatisation campaign: under 
pressure for balancing its budgets, the public administration had began to look 
into ways to discharge the disaffected real estate stock, including housing and 
facilities, industrial areas and unbuilt land in various parts of the city, through 
large scale sales, “as a conveniently quick means of reducing deficits and 
downsizing government within an urban politics framed by crisis." (Beveridge 
and Naumann 2013:190).  
In 2001, the Berlin Senate established the city’s Liegenschaftsfonds 
(German for Real estate Fund), a private company owned by the Land of Berlin, 
dedicated to sell publicly owned sites and properties that have lost their 
functions. Like in many cities during times of financial crisis, the privatisation of 
public assets proved to be an uneven and opaque process, where the “new forms 
of cooperation occur in an 'institutional void' where rules are mostly hidden from 
the public” and where “bypassing building and planning laws, these [so-called 
urban development] contracts allowed for investor-friendly agreements, including 
the allocation of public subsidies” and have “largely remained unknown to the 
public.” (Dohnke 2013: 262) The government’s strategy to sell properties for the 
highest bid and en bloc gave significant advantages to institutional investors over 
tenants and cooperatives: large investors could both provide the necessary 
equity for en bloc purchases and negotiate discount prices for individual units, 
bought in “packages” (Uffer 2013:157). These advantages also meant that 
“urban politics and policy-making centred on social equity has increasingly 
retreated to the background.” (Dohnke 2013: 262) 
The privatisation process was facilitated by the global financial markets. The 
stock market crash of 2000 and the growing distrust in the previously favoured 
IT stocks pushed investors towards the supposedly safe real estate market. In 
the same time, interest rates were substantially reduced by the central banks 
who wanted to prevent a recession (Uffer 2013:157). The cheap capital that 
flooded international markets found an easy way into real estate, and in 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
ExRotaprint Berlin Observatory Case 
8 
 
particular, into Berlin real estate. This created a new situation in the city: while 
in the 1990s, investment in Berlin properties was mainly coming from German 
investment firms, they were joined in the early 2000s by large international firms 
(Uffer 2013:159). The presence of cheap money prompted investors into real 
estate development projects that corresponded to no real demand. This 
speculative real estate boom had a strong impact on the city and its spaces.  
4 The initiative  
The Rotaprint complex was no exception from the privatisation plan: the 
buildings were separated from the adjacent wastelands and these latter were put 
up for sale. The neighbouring parcels were sold to Lidl to open a supermarket. 
ExRotaprint founders Daniela Brahm and Les Schliesser were alarmed by the 
neighbourhood’s transformation.  
“We were up here, and saw this development, which was kind of a warning 
shot for us. We thought, ‘we have better ideas.’” Les Schliesser   
The fact that investors at the time were not interested in the Wedding district, a 
then working-class area, helped the tenants to gain some time. Artists Daniela 
Brahm and Les Schliesser developed a concept for the complex and approached 
other tenants with the idea of making the ExRotaprint project together. In 2005 
they founded the tenants’ association called ExRotaprint e.V. The association 
allowed the tenants to pursue a concept for the area from the perspective of the 
tenants, and to begin negotiations with the Liegenschaftsfonds about buying the 
property. The key challenge for the tenants was to make themselves seen as 
legitimate partners by the Liegenschaftsfonds. 
After the association’s first meeting with the Liegenschaftsfonds, the tenants 
decided to make a symbolic bid of one euro, to be part of the game. ExRotaprint 
was the only bidder, but the Liegenschaftsfonds did not sell the compound for 
one euro. The Liegenschaftsfonds calculated a price of 2.4 million euros for the 
compound, which the association found too high, considering the bad shape of 
the building. In the following discussions, the Liegenschaftsfonds offered a 
heritable building right (Erbbaurecht) contract that gave a new direction to the 
negotiations. In the meanwhile, however, the Liegenschaftsfonds began to 
arrange a deal with an Icelandic investor who was preparing to buy many public 
properties in Berlin at once - the Rotaprint compound was part of the package.  
After the package sale failed in February 2007 and due to political pressure 
mounted by ExRotaprint with the help of the press, the Liegenschaftsfonds 
restarted negotiations with the board of ExRotaprint. Knowing that the price of 
the compound in the package for the islandic investor was – the very low – 
600.000 euros, ExRotaprint was able to buy the premises. 600.000 euros for the 
10.000 m2 compound was way cheaper than ExRotaprint expected, the spectre 
of individual profit began to haunt the group again. In order to safeguard the 
purchase price against speculative gains and to ensure their work on the 
ExRotaprint project, the group decided to split the ownership of the land and the 
buildings and negotiated a heritable building right with the trias and Edith 
Maryon foundations. 
ExRotaprint was born from a variety of motivations. First, ExRotaprint members 
wanted to create a different idea of ownership and find a solution for 
affordable rent. Second, they wanted to keep the space open for the people in

Wedding and to contribute to the area by generating social, economic and 
cultural capital. Third, they wanted to preserve the heritage buildings of 
the Rotaprint compound and prevent their sale and future speculation in the 
area.

5 The area  
ExRotaprint is located in the former workers’ district Wedding. Historically, the 
river close-by was used to supply water for the area’s production facilities and 
the factories created a polluted environment. With West-Berlin’s isolation and 
city planners’ desire to eliminate the industrial past and create a modern city, 
many of these factories had vanished and with them, many jobs disappeared 
leaving behind high levels of unemployment.  
When two artists, Daniela Brahm and Les Schliesser began to rent a studio space 
in the Rotaprint complex in 2000, the compound was in the middle of a 
wasteland, following the demolition of all the adjacent production halls. With little 
interest from investors, Wedding kept its traditional working-class character 
longer than many other Berlin districts.

In the following decade, however, with rising prices in Berlin’s more central 
neighbourhoods and the construction of the city’s new Hauptbahnhof, Wedding 
has gradually “moved closer to the centre.” The arrival of new, younger 
populations priced out of former “creative” neighbourhoods brought a process of 
gentrification to Wedding, with potential conflicts between newcomers and earlier 
residents, and with rising pressure on housing prices. In order to limit its 
contribution to gentrification and to resist homogenisation, ExRotaprint’s rental 
policy assures a mix of functions, providing opportunities to a great variety of 
users.  
6 The buildings and their adaptive reuse   
"The architecture was the motor driving us here and giving us energy." 
Daniela Brahm 
ExRotaprint is a 10000 m2 complex, an ensemble of 11 buildings located in 
Wedding. Following the destructions of the war, it was partially renovated in the 
early 1950s: at first Hans Heinze redesigned the existing buildings to appear 
more modern.  
“The architects added larger windows, put white plaster on the façade and 
elevated the outer wall to make it look like it had a flat roof and not a 
steep one. These were very small interventions but showed the intentions 
of the architects.” Oliver Clemens 
In the second half of the 1950s, the renovated buildings were complemented 
with new buildings designed in a post-war modernist architecture style by Klaus 
Kirsten. In 1955-56, Rotaprint’s elegant Technical Office is built, with a 185 m2 
main room surrounded by characteristic glass windows that today serves as an 
event venue. In 1957-58, another office building was built at the 
Gottschedstraße and Bornemannstraße corner. The bare concrete “brutalist by 
accident” Corner Tower is unique in Berlin with its rough concrete surface. The 
tower remained unfinished: the architect wanted to have two more stories and 
then a final façade, but it was never completed. In 1957-59, the Carpentry and 
Training Workshop Building was added to the complex.  
“Many people think of heritage buildings being more expensive and 
holding you back from new ideas, but we never felt it as a restriction, it 
was an interesting and encouraging aspect for us.” Daniela Brahm 
With the last act of a retiring heritage protection officer, the ensemble of 
buildings at Gottschedstraße 4, Bornemannstraße 9-10, and Wiesenstraße 29 
became listed monument in 1991; the decision infuriated the city 
administration owning the compound as it prevented it from demolishing the 
building. The protected buildings became the centre of identity for the area: an 
important part of the ExRotaprint compound’s attractiveness is its unique 
architectural appearance. The concrete towers had an important role in the 
artists’ choice to start renting a space in the complex first, and to protect the 
buildings from speculation later. Years later, the tower remains an icon for the 
ExRotaprint project.

Driven by their curiosity of the ExRotaprint’s peculiar architecture, its founders 
started to research for more information about the buildings. Realising that their 
architect, Klaus Kirsten is virtually unknown, Daniela Brahm and Les Schliesser 
began an inquiry into his work and have published a book on the architect.  
When ExRotaprint took over the buildings, they had been neglected for almost 20 
years. The former production company, struggling to keep its production running 
and to avoid bankruptcy, did not invest in its maintenance. The municipality, 
taking over the building’s ownership and ignoring its heritage value, only did 
rough interventions in the buildings. The buildings did no longer respect current 
building codes. Some rooftops and the floors were partly covered with vinyl and 
tiles containing asbestos, the buildings did not match fire protection standards; 
moreover, they required insulation that would allow preventing energy lost and 
environmental sustainability. Two types of intervention were immediately 
required. Firstly, it was important to secure the buildings so they do not 
deteriorate any longer. Secondly, it was important to clean it from toxic materials 
and try to adjust the buildings to the current building code and safety 
regulations.  
“The renovation will never stop, there is no point where it’s finished. 
Something a developer wouldn’t do. They would put in money, work for a 
few years and then they would say ‘now it’s finished for the next 30 years.’ 
But it’s different here, it allows you to make more experiments.” Oliver 
Clemens 
Most of the renovation work focused on adapting the building to the needs of 
the renters. From the tenants’ perspective, the most important thing is to keep

12 
 
the rents low, so following a strict budget plan was fundamental. Instead of 
moving out all tenants and have a complete renovation, the idea was to 
renovate the building step-by-step, in a process, keeping 85-90% of the 
building rented and around 10% under renovation. This process, defined by the 
limited budget available for the renovation, allowed the organisation to continue 
generating revenue from the rents to finance a mortgage and to adjust the 
renovation plans when needed. The renovation has taken over ten years up to 
now, tenants had to adapt and accept the noise and dirt of a construction site 
and to accept relocating from room to room when necessary. 
“For us it is important to follow the viewpoint of the renters in all 
development aspects: financially, the weight of the construction work, and 
the depth of the renovation.” Les Schliesser  
The ExRotaprint planning team consisting of Daniela Brahm, Les Schliesser and 
architects Oliver Clemens and Bernhard Hummel, try to preserve the original 
architectural features of the complex as much as possible and to avoid to simply 
replace old elements with new ones. The hardest part of the renovation was 
finding original materials for the interiors, like ceramic tiles, as well as craftsmen 
capable of dealing with particular architectural elements, like the concrete 
façade. For instance, steel frame windows usually are not suitable any longer, 
and larger companies would have preferred to build them anew; but a small local 
steel company accepted to install steel windows by hand, fixing the existing 
frames room by room.  
“The design process depends very much on the people who do the work 
here. You can’t describe the job and then make a tender with 50 bidders 
and take the cheapest. These are very specific tasks.” Oliver Clemens 
The windows have been renovated and walls have been insulated to reduce the 
heat loss: this change reduced heating costs from 1,80 euros per square metre 
per month for heating to 1,20 that corresponds to an important saving in 
ExRotaprint’s budget. Moreover, work has been done to open roof lights, to 
enlarge some spaces buy tearing down the walls of smaller rooms and office 
spaces were created on the rooftop. Further improvements inside the units were 
organised mostly by the tenants according to their needs.   
“We are aware of the special details, materials, and how valuable they are. 
We were always looking for a solution for the renovation with much higher 
protection that is usually done. The municipality is pretty happy with the 
result because it's more than what they usually get.” Oliver Clemens 
7 Activities 
As established in its founding documents, ExRotaprint rents spaces for various 
uses and to a heterogeneous group of tenants. One third of the compound’s 
square meters is dedicated to social projects. For instance, ExRotaprint hosts a 
variety of language classes, a social outreach organisation which works with 
unemployed, and a school that works with local teenagers who left school. 
Another third of the area is dedicated to productive activities, workshops, 
production companies that create regular jobs. The last third of the compound is 
used by artists, designers, musicians and other creatives. ExRotaprint did define

this proportion in the heritable building right contract with the foundations trias 
and Maryon in order to make it obligatory in perpetuity.  
“We have this fantastic architecture, a very inspiring place, but we think it 
should not be for artists and creatives alone. There are designers and 
unemployed, and there are migrants and craftsmen and small factories; 
and this comes together in a really heterogeneous picture.” Les Schliesser 
Besides accommodating its tenants, ExRotaprint opens to the neighbourhood 
and the city in a variety of ways. Its canteen, situated at the entrance of the 
compound, offers affordable breakfast, lunch, coffee and cakes, and is 
frequented by not only tenants of ExRotaprint but also residents from the 
neighbourhood. The Glass Box, ExRotaprint’s 185 m2 Project Room situated at 
the centre of the compound, welcomes events of various types, with a rental fee 
dependent on the type and scope of the project.  
“We don’t want to be a happy island of the creative class, we want to 
make something that makes sense here. If you have space you should 
do something for the people that directly shape the area. We want

8 Governance 
ExRotaprint was initiated by two artists, Les Schliesser and Daniela Brahm, who 
had been renting space at the former Rotaprint premises since 2000. They were 
joined by other tenants and created the ExRotaprint e.V. Association in August 
2005. The association served as a platform to discuss the long-term perspective 
and legal structure of the tenants’ organisation. Following the decision of the 
association to establish a non-profit company to take over the site, the 
ExRotaprint gGmbH was created in July 2017 by seven tenants, two other 
associates and the association itself: each tenant could decide if they wanted to 
join the gGmbH as well.  
“We accepted that not so many people wanted to participate in the non-
profit company. Making participation a duty would have been exclusive: a 
lot of people that are working here are not interested in being involved in 
community matters.” Daniela Brahm  
 
“We choose a non-profit limited company to exclude the possibility of 
individual profit and speculation, and to ensure that we will never have the 
same problem again with the compound being sold.” Les Schliesser 
The structure of both the association and the non-profit company imply an 
inclusive, participatory decision-making structure. Even tenants who chose 
not to be involved in the gGmbH, can be represented through the association’s 
membership in the company. The company partners, including the board of the 
association, meet once a month. Tenants who are affected by renovation are 
continuously consulted. The planning team, consisting of founders Daniela Brahm 
and Les Schliesser as well as the two architects Oliver Clemens and Bernhard 
Hummel, meets once a week to manage the renovation progress. Decisions on 
major interventions and the general direction of the company are taken within 
the gGmbH. 
 
 
 
 
A gemeinnützige GmbH (gGmbH) is a charitable company with limited 
liability under German law. The purpose of charitable companies is to benefit 
the common good: in Germany, many hospitals, kindergartens and museums 
are managed as charitable companies. gGmbHs combine the benefits of non-
profit organisations and for-profit companies and enable organisations to 
conduct economic activities while pursuing charitable goals. In gGmbHs, profits 
cannot be distributed among shareholders, but must be redirected towards the 
company objective. Salaries are connected to work performance. gGmbHs are 
exempted from certain taxes as long as they comply with charitable law. 
ExRotaprint’s founders chose the gGmbH format to allow economic activities 
but exclude profit extraction from the organisation.

9 Legal instruments 
“We realised that in the future when the compound is renovated, its value 
would increase immensely and we feared the group would fall apart 
because of individual interests.” Daniela Brahm 
From the beginning, the perspective of personal profit or an individual 
investment return was conceived as a significant threat for the project, 
potentially damaging for the community and the future use of the compound. In 
order to avoid the possibility of speculation, ExRotaprint brought in two 
foundations whose core mission is to prevent speculation with land. According to 
the arrangement with the anti-speculation foundations, the ground on which the 
complex is located is owned by Stiftung trias and Stiftung Edith Maryon and the 
buildings are owned by the ExRotaprint gGmbH. As a result of this split 
ownership, none of the owners can sell the buildings and make a profit out of the 
changing value of the complex; therefore, speculation with the buildings is 
legally excluded from the owners’ choices.  
“It was important for us to show that a new and different way to deal with 
property is possible and to make sure that the people who make up the 
district can continue to use the space.” Les Schliesser 
 
“We wrote down in our preamble that we rent out to work, art and 
community in equal parts, it’s in our heritable building right, so also 
future generations also have to fulfil it. The contracts build the 
framework for the future. We can do anything within this framework, 
and there are so many possibilities, but we are non-profit.” Daniela 
Brahm   
Both the German Stiftung trias and the Swiss Stiftung Edith Maryon are engaged 
in taking land off the market in a way that it cannot be sold again. It also 
includes “liberating” the land by gradually freeing it from debt. The foundations 
usually work with heritable building right (Erbbaurecht) contracts of 99 years, 
allowing them to prevent the sale of the land or radical changes in the land use, 
but enabling their partners to develop long-term projects on the land, 
corresponding to the initially agreed, socially and environmentally responsible 
goals. The barrier these foundations represented to selling the compound and 
making profit from it was exactly the kind of limitation the ExRotaprint members 
Heritable building right (Erbbaurecht) is a form of long-term lease 
established in Germany more than 100 years ago to lease land to cooperatives 
building affordable housing or to enable poor families to build a house. This 
instrument allows tenants to pay an annual interest or lease fee instead of 
buying the land with an initial capital. In the case of ExRotaprint, the gGmbH 
pays the land lease fee to the foundations trias and Maryon. The long-term 
lease enables tenants to invest significantly in the site, building new structures 
or renovating old ones, therefore in practice it equals to ownership rights, 
except for the right of selling the properties. In fact, heritable building right is 
frequently used today to keep land in public ownership but encourage tenants 
to invest in the properties, or to keep land out of the speculation market. The 
heritable building right contract also includes restrictions for the use of the 
properties, thus creating a mandatory framework for the future.

were looking for. Establishing a heritable building right contract with the 
foundations was considered as a good tool to avoid future speculation and the 
possibility of individual profit. 
“With this construction the ground is separated from the buildings. 
The ground is now owned by the foundations and we own the 
buildings. So we can decide everything, what ExRotaprint should be, 
how we finance the renovation of the buildings, and we decide who 
should rent there and we put up the whole thing. We are in an 
ownership-similar situation. But the only thing we can never do, we 
can never sell ExRotaprint to anybody.” Les Schliesser 
 
“When we buy properties, our goal is to secure spaces of freedom. Prices 
are getting higher, international capital looks for good investments and 
finds it in real estate.” Rolf Novy-Huy 
10 Financial resources 
When ExRotaprint began to negotiate with Stiftung trias, the foundation was still 
very small: it could not afford the 600.000 euros purchase price. They brought in 
the Maryon Foundation, disposing of a larger capital, and together they bought 
the compound for 600.000 euros which was even back in 2007 less than the 
standard land price. According to the agreement, ExRotaprint pays a yearly 5.5% 
interest rate of the purchase price, a sum that does not threaten the existence of 
the project but which creates a revenue for the foundations that they can later 
reinvest in other initiatives that are preparing to purchase their land. In the final 
setup, secured for decades, the foundations own the land and ExRotaprint owns 
the buildings.  
Stiftung trias is a foundation that helps community groups and co-housing 
projects access financing and move properties out of the speculation market. 
Engaged in disseminating knowledge about non-profit real estate development, 
trias collects and shares knowledge about co-housing projects and supports 
initiatives with relevant literature, network and financial resources. To receive 
financing from trias, initiatives undergo a 6-months-to-2-years process 
through which trias examines the liability of the initiatives. A non-profit-
orientated profile is key to work with trias, moreover, the foundation evaluates 
the proposed initiatives, their goals, their members and organisational 
structure, and it checks their economic sustainability. Trias invests personnel 
capacity in the initiatives they collaborate with: they can join them in crucial 
situations, like meetings with the municipality or the mayor, with banks, help 
them with their financing sheet, help to find their legal form and to define their 
financial instruments. Moreover, trias looks at the evolution of their finances 
and if possible, it can adjust its land lease fee to make their first years easier 
for the initiatives. They also expect support from the initiatives once they have 
stabilized their projects. Trias ensures that over the years, the initiatives 
preserve their core goals and it that they keep functions agreed on in the 
contract, yet trias does not give directives to the management of single 
initiatives nor it influences its renovation, rental charges, and activities.

“For us it was interesting because it’s a kind of circulating money. We 
pay money back to foundations that have no other goal than to 
prevent real estate speculation at other places again, so they make 
money with the existing heritable building right contracts to work 
further.” Daniela Brahm 
 
“To work with us is an act of solidarity: after 30 years when they repaid all 
their bank loans and don’t have any debts anymore, they continue paying 
the land lease fee into a solidarity fund.” Rolf Novy-Huy 
Besides paying the yearly rate to the foundations, ExRotaprint is also responsible 
for the gradual renovation of the buildings, a much more significant cost. In 
order to manage this, ExRotaprint took a mortgage of 2.3 million euros (with 4% 
interest) in 2009, to cover the total renovation costs estimated to reach 3.2-3.3 
million euros, the rest of which is to be paid from the compound’s revenues. The 
mortgage was also taken from a very specific financial actor, a Swiss pension 
trust called CoOpera Sammelstiftung PUK, specialised on sustainable real estate 
projects with a strong local social or cultural dimension. With rules prohibiting it 
from putting their money on the stock market, CoOpera has to work with existing 
projects.  
“For a normal bank we would have been a high-risk project. CoOpera 
met us and said ‘For us meeting you and seeing your will to get this 
project through is the greatest guarantee.’ Besides this, we had a 
reliable economic calculation, with a different approach than other 
banks.” Les Schliesser 
In  2017,  ExRotaprint  received  500,000  euros  grant  from  the Berlin  LOTTO 
Foundation for the renovation. To cover the renovation costs beyond the loan and 
the  grant,  the  surplus  from  the  rental  income  is  always  reinvested  into  the 
renovations. As of 2019, ExRotaprint has spent around 4.2 million euros for the 
restoration and maintenance of the compound.  
Our role as an architect is much wider than usually. It’s all about money and 
we have a very tight corridor, we have very little money and we can’t just 
start something and say ‘well, let’s look how much it costs’; we have to be 
sure we can solve it with the money we have.” Oliver Clemens  
ExRotaprint’s  revenue  relies  completely  on  the  income  from  rents.  In  the  past 
years,  its annual  rental income  totals  370,000  euros  per  year.  According  to  the 
heritable building right contract ExRotaprint pays an annual ground rent equal to 
10% of net rental income or a minimum of at least 5.5% of the initial land value. 
ExRotaprint’s  unique  organisational  structure  and  financial  model  allows  it  to 
operate  almost  completely  independently  from  the  real  estate  market,  but  not 
without significant pressure from the mortgage payments: all rates and conditions 
Solidarity fund: The organisations that work with Stiftung trias agree on 
paying a land lease fee of 4%, which often appears less preferable than a bank 
mortgage, as it is a lifelong security-contract with the foundation. In reality, 
these fees constitute a solidarity fund. Trias invests the revenues and the 
donations received by private donors in other similar initiatives and the 
purchase of land, and it works as a watchdog over the initiatives, regularly 
controlling that they remain faithful to their original ideal. The organisations 
who decided to collaborate with trias do so because of their interest in 
supporting a fund which advocates for non-profit land use.

have  to  be  fulfilled.  On  the  other  hand,  nobody  in  the  organisation  receives  a 
personal investment return but everyone shares the benefit of an affordable rent 
and  autonomy in  the  decision  making.  Without  pressing  financial  burdens, 
ExRotaprint  can  accommodate  a  real  diversity  of  tenants,  faithful  to  its  original 
mission.

11 Community involvement 
Since the beginning of the development of ExRotaprint, community involvement 
has  had  an  important  role.  The  first  step  in  gathering  support  to  protect  the 
complex from being sold to investors was to involve tenants on the compound 
and build a tenants’ association. At the time of this mobilisation, tenants did not 
know one another, despite working within the same buildings. Daniela Brahm and 
Les Schliesser began to approach the various tenants, documenting their use of 
the compound’s spaces. They took photographs of the spaces and made interviews 
with  tenants  to  discover  the  value  of  their  investments  and  to  explore  their 
activities. This research resulted in a document where the desire of preserving and 
expanding this local structure was expressed. 
From its foundation, ExRotaprint was strongly engaged with its neighbourhood and 
the  broader  Wedding  district.  The  way  ExRotaprint’s  rental  policy  was  designed 
reflects  a  strong  commitment  to  work  with  local  communities,  provide  spaces, 
services and workplaces for local residents. Through a variety of social activities, 
community  outreach  projects,  the  canteen  and  events,  ExRotaprint  has  been 
communicating  intensely  with  people  living  in  the  neighbourhood.  Inspired  by 
ExRotaprint’s success in moving a 10,000 post-industrial complex out of the real

estate  market,  an  entire  community  was  born  to  advocate  for  alternative 
approaches to real estate and city development.

12 Impact 
One of the main impacts of ExRotaprint is to provide affordable working 
spaces among rising prices all across Berlin. This affordability is enabled by the 
low land lease fees paid to the foundations trias and Maryon, due to the low 
purchasing price of the complex in 2007. Real estate prices have literally 
increased tenfold in the area in the past 12 years and this transformation 
highlights the importance of ExRotaprint’s financial stability.  
“The goal is to have low rents, in Berlin rents are rising immensely. In 
this respect Berlin is normalising, it’s becoming a normal capital.” 
Daniela Brahm  
The rent prices in ExRotaprint are between 3-5.4 euros per m2. While rents in 
the compound were at an average level at the time of the purchase of the site, 
today they are considered very low, compared to other spaces in the area of 
other neighbourhoods of Berlin. With rising rents and profits made from real 
estate development across Berlin, many of the tenants would not necessarily 
have another choice of location. ExRotaprint has played an active role in offering 
new opportunities for those who are usually the victims of gentrification: besides 
accommodating affordable work spaces for companies that would need to move 
outside the city otherwise, it became an open area also creatives, artists, drop-
out teenagers, immigrants, refugees, newcomers and the unemployed.

The compound’s diversity corresponds to its rental policy: instead of following a 
regular investor’s logic, the calculation of the renovation costs, for instance, is 
based on the tenants’ needs. Diversity can only be maintained if expenses are 
kept low, and there is no profit made on the owners’ side.  
“There  is  a  lot  of  social  capital,  a  lot  of  possibilities  created  here,  but  no 
profit on the owners’ side but on the users’ side.” Les Schliesser 
With its successful model, ExRotaprint has gained influence both in the 
neighbourhood and in the city. The organisation’s engagement helped a series of 
initiatives gain access to shared ownership of buildings with the help of heritable 
building right contracts. Even corporate neighbours like the Lidl adjacent to the 
ExRotaprint site agreed to cooperate about the future development of the block.  
“With this project you have the credibility to ask for more influence. We do 
something here which is unique, we offer space for workshops, people are 
working here, just consider the situation not only from the profit point of 
view.” Daniela Brahm  
At the city level, ExRotaprint’s strategy to oppose investor-led privatisation and 
create a community-driven civic space has proven highly inspiring for many 
initiatives across the city and beyond as they were facing similar threats from the 
side of the city’s real estate policy and large institutional investors and 
developers. 
“We can show how it works to take speculation out of the real estate 
sector. We have renovated the buildings and the rent is still low, which 
nobody believes. Most people think there is some kind of subsidy but there 
is not, simply the rent pays the credit.” Les Schliesser 
Inspired by the ExRotaprint and other initiatives, in the early 2010s many 
initiatives recognised this impact and began to mobilise the public opinion 
against privatisation, or in certain cases, for more controlled privatisation. While 
the community-led purchase of the ExRotaprint compound was a key factor in 
revealing the possibilities of alternative finance, many people were simply 
alarmed by the lack of transparency in the privatisation process. 
“In the last decade, Berlin progressively stopped having easy accessibility 
of space with low rents and land prices have raised quickly. We interfere 
on different levels politically to spread our ideas of an open city with 
chances for all inhabitants.” Daniela Brahm  
One of the key forums of this discussion was the initiative Stadt Neudenken. 
Stadt Neudenken was founded in 2011 in order to channel the voices of citizen 
initiatives and founders of civic spaces into a public discussion about the 
Berlin’s real estate policy. Grounding the initiative was motivated by the lack 
of participation in issues of public real estate management.  
Stadt Neudenken in 2012 managed to establish a roundtable on real estate 
policy in Berlin organised once in every three months, bringing together actors 
with very different positions, from representatives of civic society and the 
cultural fields to politicians and administration. The goal of the meetings was to 
shape the city’s new real estate policy and a sort of a real estate board or panel, 
that could be a body consisting of stakeholders from civil society that possesses 
the expertise and perhaps even indicate the spectrum of different existing 
interests in real estate properties. The main focus of the roundtable was to

Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
ExRotaprint Berlin Observatory Case 
21 
 
develop an alternative to the regular privatisation process where the highest bid 
wins the tender. 
Based on these considerations, on November 3, 2011, the Stadt Neudenken 
initiative issued a position paper and founding manifesto. The manifesto, calling 
for an immediate moratorium on public property sales, also created a list of 
recommendations for property management. In the same period, the City 
Council had also been working on its Neue Liegenschaftspolitik, following the 
approval of its need by the city council in 2010 and the governing coalition in 
2011. While Ulrich Nussbaum, the city’s financial senator, who was under 
pressure because of the unpopularity of the privatisation process, quit his office 
within a few weeks after the publication of Stadt Neudenken’s manifesto, he also 
came up with the idea of a “Neue Liegenschaftspolitik” as his last move before 
departure.  
In the core of the new Real Estate Policy proposed by Stadt Neudenken was a 
different set of criteria for privatisation processes: a “concept method” that gave 
priority to the “best concept” instead of the highest bid. The first, informal 
concept-based process was organised at the Blumengrossmarkt, an area that 
was originally the starting point for the founding of Initiative Stadt Neudenken.  
The experience of ExRotaprint and the initiatives it inspired has altered the 
discussion about potential development schemes in Berlin. With the emergence 
of a city-wide discourse on real estate policies and with events like the 
Experimentdays, notions of community ownership and non-speculative real 
estate development have gained significant influence across Europe and beyond.

Executive summary 
London CLT is London’s first Community Land Trust established in the former 
psychiatric hospital of St Clements, in the Mile End area. The CLT provides 
affordable housing, allowing long-term residents who would be priced out to stay 
in the area, countering the tendencies of displacement and housing 
unaffordability. Supported by the Greater London Authority to work with a 
private developer and a social housing association, the CLT was allocated 23 
homes that are dispersed throughout alongside privately owned and social 
housing units. Besides these homes, the CLT also promotes community 
engagement and is actively working on the creation of a community centre at the 
St Clements site.

2 The story of the building complex  
Located on an important road connecting the City of London with East Anglia, St 
Clements was built in 1848 and opened in 1849 as a workhouse: a place where 
poor people were sent who had no means of supporting themselves. The 
establishment of the Bow Workhouse was prompted by the parliament’s Poor 
Law Amendment of 1848 that required areas to institutionalise their relief efforts 
towards the poor: St Clemens was built by the City of London but outside the 
City itself.  
Many of the people put here to work were too young, too old or sick, therefore 
they could not work as planned. As a result, in the 1860s, the workhouse’s 
function shifted towards being an infirmary. In 1909, the workhouse closed and 
reopened in 1912 as a place run by the London County Council, hosting over 600 
people who were chronically ill – a hospital in today’s terminology. During WWII, 
a part of the site was destroyed, and after the war if became a fully-fledged 
hospital. In 1959, the complex became a psychiatric hospital under the NHS and 
was closed down in 2005, staying empty for about ten years, reaching a derelict 
state.  
“When we were doing a listening campaign around the area looking for 
sites, St Clements was a large derelict site in a fairly central area but it 
also had a lot of stories connect it to the local residents.“ Hannah Emery-
Wright

3 The initiative  
In 2005, the Olympic Park Legacy Company (later London Legacy Development 
Corporation) of the London Mayor’s Office asked Citizens UK to support the city’s 
Olympic Bid. Citizens UK agreed to work with the Mayor’s Office but asked for a 
series of promises, including building Community Land Trust homes on the 
Olympics site after the Games. Before this promise could be delivered, the 
Mayor’s Office wanted to see the CLT model working in practice, and asked for a 
test project. Community organisers at Citizens UK began a listening campaign 
across Tower Hamlets and identified housing as a key priority and St Clements as 
a potential site for a CLT. Once the site defined, Citizens UK ran a political 
campaign to secure it and established London CLT in 2007 in order to bid for the 
site. In 2009 St. Clements was chosen by a unanimous vote by members to be 
the focus of the campaign for London’s first CLT.  
In 2010, the site was opened up for competitive bidding by the Mayor’s Office. 
London CLT presented a bid with Igloo Regeneration, an ethical real estate 
company, proposing a community-led design process. London CLT’s consortium 
was outbid by Linden Homes, a brand of Galliford Try, a leading construction 
company, and Peabody, a social housing association. Despite the failure of the 
bid, there was significant political support from successive mayors (Ken 
Livingstone and Boris Johnson) for the CLT model and London CLT was brought 
into the winning project with the agreement of all parties. As part of the 
agreement with the GLA on winning the land, Linden Homes were required to 
enter the agreement on including the CLT, as well as passing the land ownership 
on to a specially established community-led charity, the Ricardo Community 
Foundation after the development is ready. In this way, St Clements was chosen 
as a pilot project to test the CLT model in an urban setting.  
“A key thing to come out of the consultation process was the desire to 
ensure that St. Clements remains at the heart of the community. As a 
prominent site with such a rich local heritage, it’s important that it remains 
accessible and resident-led.” Hannah Emery-Wright  
Once the new alliance with Linden Homes was formed, London CLT began 
working with the architecture office JTP to develop ideas and a vision for the site 
that could serve as a basis for the planning applications. This included a series of 
community consultation events and meanwhile use organised by the CLT’s 
Meanwhile Mixed-Use working group that later gave birth to the not-for-profit 
organisation Shuffle.   
Starting in 2013, Shuffle, with support from various cultural institutions and film 
director Danny Boyle, organised a series of festivals in and around the St 
Clements site, inviting people to experience the area differently, to share their 
memories and feelings about the site as well as to explore its potentials. Despite 
all the difficulties of acquiring permissions for cultural events at the site, Shuffle’s 
events became a great success.  
“That sort of awareness about how a site fits in to the community and how 
it can have functions even before it’s redeveloped is really important.” 
Charles Campion 
In 2014, planning applications for the site were approved, and demolitions began 
on the site. Plans were later amended to include the John Denham building as a

community centre. Since 2015, London CLT has been working on finding way to 
renovate the building and converting it into a community venue.

4 The site and the area  
The St Clements site includes 19 buildings and building parts, a combination of 
old and new. The site reveals a distinct progression of buildings, starting with a 
reception block at Northern part of the site, followed by a chapel and two major 
wings for the wards, then the kitchens and the workshops, the infirmary and the 
fever ward. At the Southern end of the site there is the mortuary on a little alley 
now called Hamlet’s Way, and beyond this, the cemetery. St Clements occupies a 
long site stretching from a major road (Mile End Road) to the Tower Hamlets 
Cemetery Park. Originally the complex was built to face the street, while today it 
is better connected with the cemetery.

“St Clements reveals a very symmetrical and orderly way to dealing with 
the poor. Almost an industrial process where you enter off the main Bow 
road into the reception wards and then move into the site with the chapel, 
the workshops and then the fever wards, the mortuary and the cemetery. 
Some people see it as a trajectory.” Nicola de Quincey  
St Clements is situated in East London, 5 kilometres from the City of London, a 
very central location within the London agglomeration. The neighbourhood has 
witnessed radical transformations in the past decades. From being a relatively 
deprivileged area with working class families, it became a centre of immigration 
in the 20th century. In the past decade, the financialisation of real estate also 
reached East London, raising housing prices and pushing out less affluent 
residents. The gentrification and affordability problem of East London has been 
one of the main motivations to develop a CLT in the area.  
5 Activities in the complex  
The renewed St Clements site has 252 homes, 53 of which are social rent homes 
provided by the Peabody social housing association. Corresponding to the idea of 
integrating the CLT in the community and avoiding the separation of social and 
private housing units, the CLT’s 23 homes are dispersed throughout the site: 13 
homes are in the central blocks that also have private units, 5 homes in a block 
with social housing units and 5 in stand-alone duplexes.  
“The idea was to integrate into the community, we didn’t want a social 
housing/private housing dichotomy.” Hannah Emery-Wright  
Besides securing affordable homes, the CLT has been active also in creating a 
community centre. For the past years, the CLT has been leading a campaign to 
turn the John Denham building, a listed building at the front of the St Clements 
site, into a community space. This is a building with many constraints and large 
spaces that limited its potential use for residential units. The building was also 
listed as an “Asset of Community Value,” referring to its significance to the wider 
community, giving the community additional time to raise funds and purchase 
the building.  
 
The campaign has involved setting up a formal residents’ commission and 
lobbying towards politicians for funding to purchase the building, as well as to 
explore the needs and opinions of local residents in relation with the site. As for 
Asset of community value is land or property of importance to a local 
community. Under the Localism Act of 2011, assets of community value (ACV) 
are subject to additional protection from development. When the owner of an 
ACV wants to sell the property, they have to inform the local authority and if a 
community group wants to buy the asset, they can trigger a moratorium for 6 
months, allowing them to raise funds to purchase the asset. The ACV status 
can be used by the local planning authority as a factor to refuse planning 
permission for full or partial change or demolition, or can force the local 
authority to buy the asset if it is under threat of long-term loss to the 
community. ACVs across the UK include over 800 pubs, sport facilities and 
stadiums as well as parks.

the commercial space below, there have been talks with Poplar Harca, an East 
London-based Housing and Regeneration Community Association to potentially 
run the café. Reusing the John Denham building as a community space would 
allow the area to have a focal point where all the different types of people who 
live in the area could meet.  
“Originally the whole site was planned to be residential, then we applied 
for a change of planning, to set aside a part of the John Denham building 
at the front for community use and the bungalow for commercial use. The 
idea was that there are so many people on site, there really needs to be 
something for them.” Nicola de Quincey

6.1 The role of heritage  
In the new urban design proposal by JTP Architects, heritage research played a 
significant role. This research, conducted by Nicola de Quincey, aimed at 
establishing not only the different phases of the evolution of the complex, but 
also to understand the significance of each historical layer and addition to the 
complex. The findings of this research informed the decisions on which buildings 
to keep and which buildings to demolish to open space for new volumes, as well

Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2

as on where to place new structures to correspond to the original layout of the 
site.  
“There are many ways to look at the buildings on the site. They could be 
studied in terms of the changing medical history, or their place in East 
London and the needs of the local area, determining their historical 
significance and value. Besides the individual buildings, the historic 
pattern of the complex was respected when we tried to think of 
opportunities for new build between the old buildings.” Nicola de Quincey  
The original St Clements site consisted of listed Victorian buildings and ancillary 
buildings of a more recent era. Many buildings at the northern part of the site, 
organised around the Clocktower, are original designs. There were many 
alterations between the original construction of the complex and the moment 
when it closed down in 2005. When the workhouse closed in 1909, its main 
building reopened in 1912 with additional shafts and altered windows. In 1920, 
adjusting the complex to its new role as a hospital, sanitary extensions, designed 
at 45 degrees to the blocks in order to maximise light penetration, were linked 
by narrow passages to the North and South Blocks. By the 1930s, when the 
London County Council was running the hospital, responding to the challenges of 
respiratory diseases like tuberculosis, two extensions were built on the side, with 
metal horizontal shaped windows that allowed more sun and light in the interiors. 
During the WWII bombing, the Women’s Block and the Chapel were destroyed. 
In the 1960s, under the auspices of the National Health Service, a series of low-
grade buildings were built between the historical buildings, some of which had 
been later demolished.

The indoor spaces of the community facilities were designed with brick, painted 
below waist height. In the 1930s, the London County Council started to put 
plaster on and NHS has put dropped ceilings: these alterations are revealed by 
the different layers in these spaces. In the John Denham building, a paint 
analysis is done to understand the original paint scheme, before a complete 
restoration or evocation of the original is done.  
Research into the layers of demolitions and additions at the site was conducted 
to inform decisions about which structures to prioritise, what to save and where 
to open space for new constructions. Erecting new volumes of buildings were 
necessary to cover the renovation costs on one hand, and to save some other 
structures, on the other. In the urban design scheme proposed by JTP, there was 
an intention to give back the symmetry to the site and build on the precedents of 
previously existent but demolished buildings: therefore, a new building was 
designed to fill the gap created by the WWII bombings.  
The heritage protection structure of the St Clements site is complex. Three 
structures of the site (the Boundary Wall, the John Denham building and the 
Administration building) are Grade 2 listed monuments. The whole site is 
curtilage listed, meaning that every single building on the site is protected. In 
addition, the site is located within the Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park 
conservation area that means that any demolition has to be approved and special 
attention has to be given by the local authority. These layers of protection signify 
that every single structure on the site had to be treated as though it was a listed 
building. The organisations Historic England (Historic Buildings and Monuments 
Commission for England) and English Heritage (English Heritage Trust) 
demonstrated a keen interest in the site and worked closely with the architects, 
the developers and the council’s conservation officer. There is a monthly meeting 
organised with the participation of these stakeholders. 
“The key thing for the authorities was that we really studied the historic 
nature of the site, worked out what we thought is the most significant and 
then worked with them on a shared vision.” Nicola de Quincey  
6.2 Design concept for adaptive reuse  
Designing the adaptive reuse of St Clements was done by JTP Architects, part of 
the original bidding consortium with Linden Homes. The focus of the reuse 
process was to create a predominantly residential-led development to provide 
over 230 homes: most buildings were turned into apartment complexes except 
the John Denham building at the front. The main design challenge was to decide 
which buildings to keep, which ones to demolish and where to place the new 
buildings. Besides historical research, the design decisions were also based on 
studies of the view of the Clocktower from different parts of the site. Moreover, 
there were a series of other regulations in play when designing the adaptive 
reuse of the St Clements site. Some of them are of logistic nature, like how to 
get fire engines in, and how to get the waste out, significant challenges for a 
long, thin site, only accessible by vehicles at the Northern end. Despite efforts by 
Historic England to keep as many workshops as possible, some of them had to 
be sacrificed in order to assure emergency access. Another key aspect of the 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
London CLT Observatory Case 
13 
 
urban design of the site was to allow free access to the site through Mile End 
Road in the North and the Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park in the South. As for the 
design of the housing blocks, it was important to not distinguish between CLT 
homes, privately owned apartments or social housing units.  
“An important thing was that this site was closed, and we wanted to make 
it more open. People wanted to use St Clements as a route through to the 
park without having to use the sidewalks. We worked very hard to get 
consent to lower one of the walls. That was an important gain for the local 
community.” Nicola de Quincey   
JTP’s approach to the bid for the site was to run a charrette or community 
planning process, inviting local stakeholders to “come, co-design St Clements” 
with them. Understanding the importance of local attachments to and stories 
about the site, the architects joined the local research conducted by the CLT and 
Shuffle in involving the community in the design process. Preceded by a 
campaign inviting the press, local stakeholders, schools and community groups, 
the charrette was organised in November 2012, including an exhibition with 
historical materials, dialogue workshops, hands-on planning workshops and 
walkabouts. The ideas collected and the consensus developed during the 
workshops by over 350 participants led the design team to create a vision for the 
area, feeding into a planning application that got unanimous approval at the 
Tower Hamlets Planning Committee about a year after the planning weekend. 
”We were working through co-designing with the community and a lot of 
consensus emerged quite quickly through the workshops which we took 
away, analysed, distilled and created a vision. We reported it back to the 
community a few days later, we took them through the history of the site, 
the co-design process and that led us to create the vision. Instead of 
designing something and then asking people what they think of it, we get a 
lot of extra social and economic value by involving communities who have 
a great knowledge and expertise.” Charles Campion 
About a third of the site today consists of existing, retained buildings, and two-
thirds of new built, resulting in a variety of building styles, combined with open 
spaces, some of them semi-private gardens, others publicly accessible.  
6.3 The construction process 
The construction process began in 2014 by clearing the site: getting rid of 
asbestos and other kinds of contamination. During the construction process, the 
CLT has experienced significant delays, ranging from one to three years. While 
residents were originally scheduled to move in in 2016, the first residents could 
only move in in June 2017 and some residents were still waiting for their turn in 
2019. Some residents had to drop out of the programme, others had to be 
reallocated, causing significant stress for the concerned families.  
“From our side it seemed like there was one issue after another in the 
building process. Lots of delays. I think this was partly due to the 
complexity of the site and the heritage elements, as well as the priorities 
of the developer.” Hannah Emery-Wright

7 Regulations and policies 
British cities, especially London, have experienced high pressure on land prices 
that led to a chronic unaffordability crisis and housing emergency. This has a 
strong impact on the feasibility of not-for-profit, community-led initiatives and 
especially on their access to land ownership or lease. The property industry 
in the UK is highly centralised: more than half of the homes in the UK are built 
by ten companies, therefore it is very hard for any new entrant to the housing 
market to succeed. Accessing finance, whether subsidy or loans, equity or 
investment is crucial to help these projects to succeed. In the 1970s and 80s, 
there was significant public support to housing cooperatives, a large part of 
today’s housing stock was built then. Many of these cooperatives continue to 
exist but they have been completely professionalised, their direction has no 
longer contact with local communities, no participation among their residents, 
and they have no influence on the wider property market, nor do they interact 
with their broader neighbourhoods. The ambition of CLTs is to operate 
differently, and not close themselves into islands of affordability.  
“The main issue in London remains land, as it is an incredibly expensive 
city. Public landowners have a potential to provide sites and consider the 
social value, when they think about the price they sell the land for. They 
also suffer terrible cuts from central government so they want to sell land 
for as much as possible. So there are lot of challenges for communities in 
getting ownership of land in London.” Tom Chance  
The St Clements site is a field where real estate pressure as well as various 
public policies are in play, regarding the sale of public land, housing provision, 
heritage protection as well as natural ecosystems. One of the key dimensions of 
public policy at St Clements is related to housing. The St Clemens site is subject 
to a Section 106 agreement that means that new developments should have 
30% affordable housing. In such cases, the developer is obliged to build 
affordable homes as well, and then looks for a housing association or similar 
organisation to take on those housing units. The CLT homes are part of this 30% 
that could otherwise be shared ownership homes.  
 
The London CLT, providing a part of the obligatory affordable homes, has been 
established following the model of Community Land Trusts (see at 
Governance). Similarly to the US, London CLT was born with the help of 
community organising, more than supporting policies. As a result of community 
Section 106 agreements are planning obligations based on the 1990 Town & 
Country Planning Act. They are private agreements made between local 
authorities and developers and can be attached to a planning permission to 
make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in 
planning terms. The land itself, rather than the person or organisation that 
develops the land, is bound by a Section 106 Agreement, something any future 
owners will need to take into account. Section 106 agreements are drafted 
when it is considered that a development will have significant impacts on the 
local area that cannot be moderated by means of conditions attached to a 
planning decision.

organising and campaigning mostly by Citizens UK, there has been a growing 
ambition to give frameworks to local governments and other public landowners 
to engage and strategically think about their opportunities to provide land for 
affordable and community-led housing.  
“In the US, a lot of the earlier CLTs came out of community organising and 
part of the ethos is that it’s not just about affordable housing but 
organising the community assets. Giving them power, getting them 
become empowered to give them the feeling they have the opportunity to 
shape their local area.” Tom Chance  
Ideally, municipalities can play a more active role in the creation of CLTs. They 
can help with their own land or through their planning policy that can release 
sites for CLTs. Many of the sites offered to CLTs are awkward, complicated sites, 
often in sensible areas that councils do not expect to sell to commercial 
developers for the market price; but most CLTs come up with very innovative 
uses for these sites. The GLA created the Small Sites, Small Builders programme 
to dispose of land owned by Transport for London with specific conditions like 
100% affordable housing and limited price, in a way to make it accessible to 
community-led organisations and to small and medium size enterprises. The 
programme lists sites open for bidding at its website, with a lot of useful 
information that helps smaller actors to prepare a bid that have no resources for 
land surveys. Besides offering land, municipalities can also provide policy support 
and small amounts of funding. Despite all this potential from the side of public 
administrations, many CLTs have succeeded without significant public support.  
“The particularity of heritage sites is that local communities might feel 
very strongly about how a particular building is used, and a community-led 
approach can deal with that.” Tom Chance  
The regulatory environment determines to a large extent what is feasible for 
CLTs. In the UK, unlike in other European countries (like in Germany) it is 
impossible to separate the ownership of land from that of buildings, that would 
help a landowner community to assure the affordability of the properties on it. 
Therefore, a leasehold structure is used for a similar purpose, but such 
arrangements were often abused by mainstream developers to make their clients 
pay increasing ground rents after buying properties. In order to prevent such 
abuses, the government banned leasehold for houses, endangering the CLT 
model. In June 2019, as a result of lobbying by the National Community Land 
Trust Network, the government gave exemption to CLTs. Similarly, the NCLTN 
has also campaigned against policies to enable tenants of social housing 
providers to buy their homes, or for CLTs’ exemption from leasehold 
disenfranchisement, the leaseholders’ right to buy the freehold of their property, 
both policies undermining CLTs.  
The emergence of CLTs also corresponds to efforts of decentralisation: to 
devolve control from the state to local governments and to local communities. 
The Localism Act, introduced in 2011 by the Tory government to support 
devolution towards communities had no significant impact on CLTs. For instance, 
the Localism Act introduced the community right to bid, meaning that 
communities can campaign for a particular building to be designated as an asset 
of community value. This designation means that if the building is sold, the 
community has a window of six months to make its own bid. However, six 
months are a very short time for a community to mobilise itself and put it a 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
London CLT Observatory Case 
16 
 
credible bid. As the property owner has no obligation to sell the building to the 
community, the community’s offer has to be competitive.  
“The Localism act was brought in, it has all these interesting ideas and 
powers most of which have been no help at all for CLTs because they 
misunderstand what the barriers are for CLTs. It would be interesting to 
see if we can mobilise interest for a more effectively second Localism Act.” 
Tom Chance  
In the past years, several policy items have been introduced to help CLTs: the 
National Community Land Trust Network had campaigned for the creation of a 
Community Housing Fund before the 2015 elections and now campaigns for 
its extension to give initiatives longer term certainty and a perspective for the 
sector to grow. In the past years, demand for CLT homes has exponentially 
grown, increasing the number of potentially deliverable homes with the fund 
from 5,000 in 2016 to 15,000 in 2019.  
8 The financial model  
In general, there are different ways to fund CLTs. In the most typical case, CLTs 
act like normal developers, they go to a charity or a socially minded bank that 
lends money at a low interest rate. In addition, CLTs get subsidies or grants from 
the government for affordable housing. Afterwards the CLT builds the homes and 
sells or rents them, using these revenues to refinance the mortgage. In other 
cases, more classical housing providers like housing associations develop homes 
in partnership with CLTs: the housing association in these cases finances and 
builds the homes and then transfers the freehold to the CLT and leases back the 
homes from the CLT. In some cases, public finance in the form of affordable 
housing subsidies can lower the costs of establishing a CLT.  
In the atypical case of the London CLT, the developer is granted planning 
permission according the Section 106 policy, and is required to deliver a certain 
amount of affordable housing, and look for organisations like CLTs to take on 
these units. According to the requirements of the GLA, London CLT has a turnkey 
arrangement with Linden Homes. London CLT purchases the properties from 
Linden, however not with London CLT’s own money but with the money of the 
residents who will move in. It is a back-to-back payment scheme where the 
resident pays London CLT and London CLT pays Linden.  
The main costs of the CLT are construction finance that should normally come 
through social investment from large donors or community shares. The London 
CLT’s first revenues came in 2016 from a community share offer with Ethex, a 
not-for-profit Positive Investing organisation. The minimum investment was £100 
each with a return on investment of about 5%. About 130 investors – some of 
them from the surrounding communities, some of them big donors – participated 
with £450,000, used to pay architects and planning preparations for London CLT’s 
Lewisham site. These investments have to be paid back after a few years, until 
then they allow the CLT to gain time and raise additional funds.  
The most important source of revenue for the London CLT was from the sales of 
the first homes at St Clements. Due to the changing property prices, a margin 
between the purchase price paid to Linden Homes at a time of lower home values

and the price paid by the homeowners later allowed the CLT to have some 
income. CLT home prices at the beginning of the process were about half the 
market prices, now they’re about one third. On the long term, however, such 
profit margins will not likely to be a source of income.  
Mortgages are another important source of funding for CLTs, on the buyers’ 
side. Initially, in the case of the St Clements site, it was difficult for prospective 
CLT homeowners to build relationships with the right mortgage lenders. London 
CLT managed to engage lenders who understand the specificity of a CLT: the 
Ecology Building Society and Triodos Bank were the first to offer mortgages. In 
the meanwhile, the NCLTN was working on getting on board other  mainstream 
lenders. Usually, such lenders want to see that the value of the property bought 
with mortgage is a percentage of the open market, so even in the case of shared 
ownership or affordable property, they base their evaluation on that percentage 
of the market. CLT homes, with their value connected to the median income 
cannot demonstrate its relation with values on the open property market. In 
order to assure lenders, the CLT added a mortgagee-in-possession clause to the 
mortgage contracts, that elaborates that if a CLT homeowner wants to sell a 
home, the CLT has 6 months to find a new tenant, after which the council has 7 
months to find a tenant, and in case both attempts were unsuccessful, the 
property can go back to the open market. 
“As a network, we have been pretty successful in growing the numbers of 
banks and social investors that are interested in the sector and are able to 
invest. There is a lot of debt finance now available for communities to 
develop housing or to renovate an existing house. Our aim is to break into 
more mainstream, larger scale equity finance so that CLTs can deliver at 
scale.” Tom Chance 
Unlike other Community Land Trusts, land at the St Clements is not community 
owned by CLT residents, however the freehold is held by a charity whose 
trustees are a number of local stakeholders. Nevertheless, with the CLT having a 
250-year lease on the property, it is protected from speculation. CLT owns the 
head lease for these properties and it can sell and underlease to the residents. 
The CLT sells properties at prices that are linked to the medium income rate of 
the borough. When a resident wants to move on, they have to sell their property 
back to London CLT at a rate that is linked to medium wages in the borough.  
“The idea behind this model is that wages are the best way to determine if 
something is affordable for the people living in the area. Our houses are 
affordable in perpetuity.” Hannah Emery-Wright 
Besides funding the planning and construction process, in order to set up a CLT, 
a core team also needs to establish and finance the work of an 
organisation that can carry out the project. In the case of the London CLT, its 
parent organisation Citizens UK initially invested some staff time in the CLT’s 
work, some of which was covered by Oak Foundation grants. In addition, the 
National CLT Network gave the London CLT a £10,000 catalyst grant for capacity 
building.  
Besides financing the CLT homes, the quest to turn the John Denham building 
into a community space has also presented a financial challenge for the CLT. In 
2015, London CLT made an unsuccessful application to the National Lottery Fund 
to finance the renovation of the John Denham building as a community venue. In 
the meanwhile, although expected to give the building to the CLT for free, Linden

Homes turned around and made a demand of £1.5 million for the building. In the 
past years, the CLT, residents and local communities have been lobbying the GLA 
and the Tower Hamlet council for funding with a series of public campaigns.  
9 Community involvement  
Despite being derelict for a long period, the St Clements site had a strong 
presence in the community, and a strong role in local memory. Many people in 
the area would know it from visiting their relatives in the psychiatric hospital, but 
an author also collected memories of children growing up in the workhouse, 
through the recollections of their children and grandchildren. Similarly, St 
Clements played an important role in defining East London identities. According 
to some local mythologies, one is a Cockney if one grew up hearing either the 
bells of Whitechapel or of the St Clements Clocktower.   
“A lot of people on the board were church leaders or local parents; we 
needed to make sure that this site is for the community. Not just as 
housing but also as facilities and the place. It needs to be not just about 
housing but a place you want to live in, that represents the kind of place 
we should be building.” Lizzy Daish  
After years of vacancy and decay, one of the ways to reconnect the site with the 
neighbouring communities was to open the site for various activities. This idea 
was implemented by the CLT’s Meanwhile Mixed-Use working group established 
in 2012, aiming at bringing events to the site before and during some phases of 
the construction. When the events and festivals organised at St Clements grew 
out of their original scale, the not for profit community enterprise Shuffle was 
established in 2013 to carry out the activities. Members of Shuffle began 
speaking with ex-patients of the hospital about their experiences and the things 
they wanted to do at the site to reclaim their stories. Shuffle’s focus was on a 
mixture of high calibre art and film and serious community programming and 
curation, always based on themes around mental health.  
“There was a lot of interest because we had this big old psychiatric 
hospital but we also wanted to make sure whatever we did on the site set 
the tone for the community housing. St Clements a lot of stories and a lot 
of those weren’t good stories. It was a very important place for 
generations. We wanted to do something that would involve people.” Lizzy 
Daish  
Culture had an important role in building relationships and support for the St 
Clements redevelopment project. The film director Danny Boyle, who grew up in 
a tower block overlooking St Clements, and was chosen to design the opening 
ceremony of the London Olympics. Boyle became very interested in the CLT, and 
helped create a series of festivals, promoted by the organisation Shuffle, with 
film screenings and other events at the St Clements site and the adjacent 
Cemetery Park.  
In order to place its events in the St Clements site, Shuffle cleaned a variety of 
spaces of the site, organising cinema screenings in the old patients’ social club 
and outside, working with gardeners to plant a flower garden from seeds donated 
from the Cemetery Park and with edible plants to be used in the café opening on

the site. Shuffle organised two large events at St Clements in 2013, a several-
month summer festival and a 10-day winter festival in November.  
“That kind of small-scale development was really important for us, it was 
what we had taken from the community planning sessions to try things 
that could happen in the long run, different ways of using the buildings.” 
Lizzy Daish  
Shuffle also conducted an oral history research among the local communities, 
concentrating on the last iteration of the complex as a psychiatric hospital, 
including the testimonies of people who had been patients of the old institution: 
the last user group of the building still living around. The oral history recollection 
was organised into an exhibition in January 2014, using the gardens and the 
John Denham building. Soon after the exhibition, demolitions began at the site 
and Shuffle moved its festival to the Cemetery Park where it organised four 
seasons.  
“We started off at St Clements with a rumour which we heard that people 
would always say to their children, ‘if you don’t eat your greens you would 
go to St Clements.’ And we then met people who were service providers 
and their stories about being in St Clements were very nuanced. For us It 
was about changing the narratives, hearing those stories. I constantly had 
to turn down all those ghost tours: that was not going to happen here as 
we were looking at the human aspect of all this.” Lizzy Daish  
While the site is up and running, and the CLT has achieved its goal of providing 
affordable housing in perpetuity, not all the results of the community 
involvement activities were used to shape the site. Some people are concerned 
with the site turning into a gated community, the direct opposite of what the 
community was aiming for. The envisioned community space in the John 
Denham building can be key in opening the site for the neighbouring 
communities.  
“We always saw that everything we did at St Clements is an example of 
what can happen in a community space once the site is redeveloped. We 
constantly fed in to the GLA, developers, architects, landscape architects 
and back to the CLT all the findings. Unfortunately, we weren’t really taken 
seriously. Maybe people just took a while to see the value in it. While it’s 
all about money and assets, it’s difficult to be at the forefront. I think there 
are more opportunities now that the CLT is working hard on securing the 
front building for a community space.” Lizzy Daish  
Besides its connections with the neighbourhood and its communities, the London 
CLT keeps its closest ties with the residents of the CLT homes. The CLT’s 
communities manager continues to work with residents through allocations 
and supports them in the process of accessing their new homes. She also 
develops specific training for the residents and campaigners about what being a 
CLT resident means. Once the new residents are in their homes, the communities 
manager works with them to look at ways to transform the neighbourhood, by 
building up community leaders, developing community spaces or by other 
means.  
“We want our residents to be involved in the governance of London CLT.”

10 Governance 
The St Clements site is governed by a cooperation between a variety of actors. 
From the viewpoint of non-speculative, community-led heritage reuse, the most 
relevant actor is the London Community Land Trust. The London CLT follows the 
format first developed in the US, where community organisations had been 
engaged with safeguarding community assets and housing from gentrification 
and financialisation. Triggered by dissatisfaction with traditional housing 
providers in the UK, CLTs have gained a lot of popularity and recognition in the 
past years. The first CLT in England was established in 1983 in Oxfordshire. In 
the following decades, many CLTs were created and also many initiatives that 
– with their community ownership of land and properties – could match the 
definition of CLTs but do not consider themselves as one.  
“Communities often feel that traditional housing providers have lost touch 
with their communities, they tend to trample over them. Many people feel 
they are being ignored or do not have control over their housing assets. 
Many local communities have a desire to get involved and to do something 
positive, and CLTs are a way they can do it.” Tom Chance  
 
Until recently, CLTs have been predominantly established in rural areas where 
land prices are cheaper and real estate pressure is lower: the CLT operating at 
Community Land Trusts are a model of community-led development, where 
local organisations develop and manage homes and other assets important to 
their communities, such as community enterprises, food growing or 
workspaces. In the Anglo-Saxon context, and spreading to the European 
continent through Belgium, France and the Netherlands, the format of 
Community Land Trusts (CLTs) has been instrumental in helping residents 
create inclusive economic ecosystems and sustainable development models. By 
owning land (or leasing it from public owners) and leasing apartments, entire 
buildings or other types of properties to individuals, families or community 
groups, CLTs can control the use and price of such properties. CLTs therefore 
can use this leverage to guarantee that spaces in their management remain 
affordable, based on the income level of the locals living in the area. Each CLT 
has a different governance system but they all share some characteristics: 
they are controlled by local residents in a democratic fashion. CLTs are 
described in the Housing Regeneration Act of 2008: any legal format that 
complies with that act can be considered as a CLT. The first CLTs were set up 
as companies limited by guarantee, and their members added to their rules 
how their assets can be used: they have to be locked for the use of the 
company. Some other CLTs are set up as charities. Nowadays most CLTs are 
established as community benefit societies, a legal format updated in 2014 
that refers to membership organisations open to anyone in the local 
community just for the benefit of that community and that matches best the 
CLTs’ ethos. The National CLT Network has developed a set of rules: most CLTs 
use these rules and it is up to their own decisions to define how their board 
should function and how they should involve their members and residents.

the St Clements site, London CLT is one of the first urban CLTs. London CLT is a 
community benefit society, a not for profit limited company – a model widely 
used by community land trusts. People join the CLT as members either because 
they are interested in buying a home on the long term, or because they like the 
project and would like to support it. Others have an academic or professional 
interest in the project. The London CLT has about 3000 members made up of 
residents who own CLT homes, the communities and campaigners from areas 
around CLT sites  and stakeholders who might invest their expertise in the CLT. 
These membership classes are all represented in the board of trustees consisting 
of 15 people. Besides the board, the CLT also has subcommittees, focusing on 
Finance and Risk, Development, Human Resources, Impact Measurement and 
allowing more in-depth discussions about these issues. Members have the right 
to vote and stand for elections. Membership requires the payment of a nominal 
sum of £1.  
 “Lots of people ask us if we would consider doing social rent as well, but 
the priority right now is to focus on getting our sale model right first.” 
Hannah Emery-Wright  
Positioning the CLT in the housing market is a sensible issue: there are various 
different social groups in urgent need of housing. There is discussion about CLTs 
potentially offering social rent but this would risk to make the organisation move 
towards the role of a housing association, with a more profit-oriented profile. 
Moreover, the CLT’s focus now is on middle/low income earners that have no 
access to social housing rents or people who are not on the priority list for social 
housing but are being priced out of their neighbourhoods. As due to the housing 
shortage in London, there is a great demand for affordable housing, London CLT 
developed a well-designed selection procedure for its homes. CLT homes are 
allocated to local residents with a deep connection to the area (worked in the 
area for at least 5 years); unstable housing situation (in risk of losing their 
homes); financial eligibility (not catered for by social housing programmes); local 
involvement (social connections in the area); supportive attitude towards the 
CLT’s values and mission (potential future CLT advocates).

London CLT is member of the National CLT Network, a nation-wide network 
representing the interests of CLTs across the UK. In 2007-2008, as a result of 
some interest among funders, some research into CLTs was done by Bob 
Patterson at Lancaster University, and three charitable foundations, the Tudor 
Trust, Carnegie and Esmée Fairbairn Foundation began to fund programmes to 
help communities set up CLTs. The need for a national body to promote the

concept of CLTs gave birth to the NCLTN in 2010 that became incorporated into a 
charity in 2014.  
“We want to support regional organisations that have the capacity and 
knowledge to develop relationships with the different local governments, 
developers, housing associations, and creating more strategic 
opportunities for communities. Our role is to ensure they have adequate 
funding and we take policy lessons from and feed is back to the central 
government.” Tom Chance  
The National Community Land Trust Network today represents all 330 CLTs 
operating in England and Wales. The network helps CLTs incorporate, supports 
its members and is engaged in creating a policy and finance environment that 
makes it possible for communities to implement new CLTs. The NCLTN also 
works with municipal authorities that are interested in offering sites for 
affordable housing or community-led initiatives, linking them with good practices 
and introducing them to successful policies. The NCLTN is less and less involved 
with individual CLTs and more focused on supporting regional organisations that 
can help local groups.  
“As the CLT movement become more established, government policy has 
had more impact on us so we have lobbied either specifically against what 
governments do that damage CLTs or in favour of things that might help 
them.” Tom Chance  
 
After establishing the first CLT in London where residents have already moved in, 
London CLT is now in the process of developing new projects outside the St 
Clements site. The next project in Lewisham will consist of 11 CLT homes, with 
the construction to start in 2019. Two Transport for London sites in Shadwell and 
Lambeth, to have around 40 and 30 homes respectively , are in consultation 
stage with local community groups. Further sites in Croydon and Redbridge are 
to be identified together with local communities. All CLTs have their own identity 
and are focusing on their own neighbourhood and local stakeholders. However, 
relationships across the different CLT sites are being developed. An important 
Establishing a CLT: Developing new sites begins with Citizens UK organising 
local communities and building campaigns that demonstrate that significant 
groundwork has been made in these areas. Such groundwork is the basis for 
the engagement of London CLT that can support building relationships, finding 
land and acquiring funding. While at the St Clemens site, London CLT is 
representative of the local community, at other sites its role is more of a 
technical advisor that supports communities developed by Citizens UK. London 
CLT’s work on these sites begins with walking around with local community 
institutions in the identified neighbourhoods, looking for possible sites. This is 
followed by running a local campaign and building relationships with a local 
decision-maker, prompting public commitments. Then the local community 
group would build relationships with the neighbours around the site, identifying 
stakeholders and setting up a committee or a steering group to discuss how to 
put in a bid for the land. The local CLT boards include community leaders, thus 
assuring that CLTs are embedded in local relationships and community 
dynamics.

part of these relationships is sharing resources, especially expertise and 
experiences: campaign groups of prospective developments often visit St 
Clements to learn about how the CLT works there. Annual meetings allow all CLT 
stakeholders from different campaign groups to come together and collectively 
make key decisions.  
11 Relationships on site  
The CLT’s leverage at the St Clements site is mostly political. Political 
engagement from the side of Ken Livingstone and later Boris Johnson was a 
response to the pressure built up by Citizens UK that held the mayors 
accountable for the St Clements site. In 2007, for instance, there was a camp 
outside City Hall highlighting the dramatic housing situation, and events like that 
were used to pressure politicians to engage with affordable housing plans. As a 
member of Citizens UK, London CLT has been building on such political pressure.  
“London CLT didn’t have any capital when we made this agreement, we 
weren’t bringing anything financially to the project, it was a political 
commitment because of the amount support we had through community 
organising and the pressure we put on decision makers to make this 
project happen.” Hannah Emery-Wright  
CLT projects in different boroughs have different relationships with the borough 
councils. The initial support of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets was not 
followed by financial subsidies during the process, allowing the CLT to keep its 
relative independence and mobility, without additional strings attached to public 
funding. In some cases, like in Lewisham, the site offered for a CLT is rather 
difficult, but still a show of public support.  
“Since CLTs aren’t prioritised, we are given sites that people don’t 
necessarily want. As CLTs become more mainstream maybe we’ll have 
more a choice over the sites we can choose.” Hannah Emery-Wright  
At the St Clements site, London CLT found itself in a cooperation with Linden 
Homes, a commercial entity, with a fundamentally different working culture. The 
different priorities of the developer caused significant delays in delivering homes, 
which forced the CLT to continuously reallocate the homes as struggling would-
be residents were forced to drop out of the process. Changing positions 
concerning the John Denham building from the side of the developer and 
incomplete legal protection on the CLT side have meant additional fundraising 
tasks for the CLT.     
“Working with Linden Homes has been difficult as we have fundamentally 
different working cultures: they are about making profit and turnover, and 
we are a non-profit organisation providing affordable homes.” Hannah 
Emery-Wright  
Important relationships with groups around the St Clements site and Mile End 
were formed already during the meanwhile use activities led by Shuffle. A key 
alliance was built with neighbouring site, the Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park 
by Shuffle when organising its meanwhile use events. The Cemetery Park is a 
nature reserve with knowledge in biodiversity and development and with the 
experience of building gardens also for housing associations: they also prepared

Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2

a biodiversity plan for St Clements. The Cemetery Park also hosted many of the 
events Shuffle organised.  
At the St Clements site, London CLT supported residents to establish residents’ 
association to include CLT residents as well as private and social housing 
residents to participate in the decision-making related to the site. This 
organisation has already been formed with a representative from each building, 
but will be formally constituted in 2020 as a resident management company to 
take over from the management company appointed by Linden Homes once the 
developers have left. Some of the residents constituting the association are also 
part of the Tower Hamlet Leadership Committee run by Citizens UK, organising a 
broader discussion about the issues of the borough. As Linden Homes have no 
long-term interest in the project, they will relinquish their stake in the site once 
they are no longer developing it. Once the development is  finished, the site will 
be handed over to a freeholder, the Ricardo Community Foundation (named after 
the famous economist David Ricardo whose family lived in the area) made up of 
different stakeholders on the site, including Peabody, the CLT, the local council, 
the Greater London Authority, Linden Homes, Galliford Try and the residents’ 
management company.   
12 Impact  
The impact of the London CLT on the St.Clements site, its neighbourhood and on 
the city is manifold. By opening the St Clements site from Bow Road through to 
Tower Hamlets Cemetery Parkthe built environment facilitated the rebuilding of 
social fabric also, making its heritage buildings and public spaces accessible for 
all surrounding neighbours and not just those on site.  
By offering affordable housing to people involved in the neighbourhood, CLT 
homes are contributing to easing the effects of London’s housing crisis. With its 
temporary use events and participatory governance model, the London CLT has 
engaged local communities to share their memories of the site, on one hand, and 
shape its future, on the other. The involvement of local residents in the CLT 
board and subcommittees, as well as their participation in local campaigns 
contributes to improving their skills and capacities of mobilisation and self-
determination.  
“It’s not enough just to build affordable homes but we want to have a 
lasting impact in the areas we work in: developing our residents as 
individuals or leaders of the community.” Hannah Emery-Wright 
At the city level, London CLT has created a precedent to showcase how CLTs can 
work in an urban setting, under strong real estate pressure. While previous CLTs 
had worked predominantly in rural areas where local communities came together 
to buy land, London CLT has opened the way for urban CLTs and showed how to 
apply political pressure in order to secure land. Reaching beyond the St Clements 
site, London CLT is involved in setting up other CLTs across London, and provides 
peer learning opportunities for other initiatives from across the country. With the 
help of the SHICC project, its resources relating to its experiences are also 
available for initiatives on the continent.

1  Introduction 
Jam  Factory  Art  Center is  an  organization  that  is  committed  to  implement  its 
vision - opening an interdisciplinary center of contemporary art in the revitalized space 
of the Jam Factory premises, which through its educational activities, exhibitions and 
research will reflect current  processes  in  Ukrainian  and  international  art  and  culture, 
and will open opportunities for public dialogue. The impressive neo-Gothic building, as 
well as several adjacent buildings from later periods, is located in the historical industrial 
district of Lviv called Pidzamche. From 1872, the alcohol factory owned by Kronik and 
Son company was operating there. It changed a number of functions and stood vacant 
from  2008,  when  the  vegetable  processing unit producing  jam  was closed.  Several 
grass-root artistic and cultural initiatives temporarily used the building in the following 
years. 
In 2015, the Austrian historian and private donor Harald Binder, well-known in 
Lviv as a founder of the Center for Urban History of East Central Europe, institution of 
research and public history, bought the Jam Factory site and initiated its revitalization 
through the Harald Binder Cultural Enterprises (HBCE). 
In  the  international  competition in 2015, the project of the Austrian bureau of 
Stefan Rindler was selected. The long process of consolidation of the land plots, getting 
permissions,  and adaptation  of  the  Austrian  project  to  the  Ukrainian  laws  and 
regulations,  with  the  help  of the  local  “AVR  Development”  bureau, started. In  the 
meantime,  the  team  of  the  project  is working  on  institution-building,  with grant 
program,  educational  lecture  series,  exhibitions,  and  art  fellowship  residences, 
functioning in the temporary locations nearby. 
In October 2019,  the  implementation  of  the  revitalization  project  started.  It 
includes  restoration  and  adaptation  of  the  2  buildings  listed  as  monuments of  local 
significance, as well as construction of new additional premises, to produce and host 
theatre plays and performances, exhibitions, workshops, event hall, offices, restaurant, 
and open public space. In the future the Jam Factory Art Center is seen as a mixed 
model,  getting  support  both  from  the  owner,  from  external  grants,  and  generating 
income through the building itself. The complete renovation of the complex is planned 
for 2021.

1872 - start of production at the alcohol factory of Joseph 
Kronik  (the  grandson  of  Moses). His  son  Leib  developed  his 
independent enterprise, also producing alcohol, next to father’s till 1898. 
1870s – Jozef Kronik settles the commercial ties with Vienna, the capital of the 
Habsburg Empire. 
1878 - the  synagogue  was  constructed on  the  neighboring  plot,  Kronik  family 
among the donors. It did not survive until today. 
Approx. 1898 – two enterprises (by Josef Kronik and his son Leib) merged, and 
company got the name “Josef Kronik and Son”. 
1912 – the “Kronik and son” enterprise received a privilege to deliver to the court 
of the Austrian-Hungarian empire (K&K Hoflieferand status). 
1914 – Kronik family escaped Russian occupation of Galicia to Vienna. Part of the 
family stayed there during the interwar period. 
1915 – the “Kronik and Son” factory was damaged because of fire caused by the 
military operations. 
1921 – Jozef Kronik renewed the production at the factory. 
1926 – Moritz Kronik, next in the dynasty, gained full ownership of the factory 
and lived both in Lviv and Vienna in the interwar period. 
1939 – Moritz Kronik escaped the Soviet occupation of Lviv to Warsaw, where he 
probably perished. 
1939-1945 – the members of Kronik family perished in the Holocaust in Warsaw 
(?) and death camps in Bielzec, Teresienstadt and Auschwitz. 
After 1945 – the former “Kronik and Son” factory was nationalized by the Soviet 
authorities  and  was  subordinated  to  the trust  “Ukrholovvyno”  (“All-Ukrainian  Vine 
Trust”). The production and distribution of the imported vines from Moldova and Alger 
took place there. 
1970s - the building started to function as a vegetable processing unit, where the 
vegetable preserves, jams, honeys, and mushrooms were made. 
2008 – the  production  stopped  on  site,  and  the  buildings were  sold  to  Oleksiy 
Kurylyshyn, Lviv  real  estate  developer  who  welcomed  temporary  uses  of  the  site  by 
artists and activists. 
2011 – the  revitalization  of  the  Jam  Factory  was  included  in  the  program  of 
Pidzamche district revitalization developed by Lviv (City Institute) and Krakow (Institute 
of Urban and Regional Development). Even though no practical steps followed on the 
side of municipality, it was a symbolic recognition of the importance of the project for 
the future of the district. 
2014 – Bozhena Zakaliuzhna (Pelenska), Lviv art curator and activist, organized 
the international workshop “Regeneration of Industrial Buildings in Ukraine”, where the 
invited experts shared their experience and also drafted some initial ideas for the Jam 
Factory. 
2015 - Harald Binder Cultural Enterprises (HBCE) was created with  the  aim  to 
revitalize  the  site  into  the  Jam  Factory Art  Center.  Austrian  historian  and  cultural 
entrepreneur Harald Binder purchased the main building. Bozhena Zakaliuzhna joined 
the initiative as a director of the Jam Factory Art Center. 
2015-2017 – the  consolidation  of  the  6  different  plots  into  one  continued. The 
architectural  competition  took  place, and the  Austrian  bureau of Stefan  Rindler was 
selected  for  the  architectural  project  design.  On  the  Ukrainian  side,  the  “AVR 
Development”  bureau was  selected  to  help  to  adapt  the  Austrian  project  to  the local 
laws and regulations. 
2016 - Strategy and Interim strategy was developed by Bozhena Zakaliuzhna.

3  The story of the building 
In 1850, Moses Kronik, the Jewish resident of the village of Znesinnia (Zniesienie) 
in close proximity to Lviv (Lemberg, Lwów), got the permission from the village’s owner 
Franciszka Laszkowska to develop a distillery in his private house located just behind 
the checking and customs point on the border of the village and Lviv. The decision to 
develop a distillery was determined both by the restrictions of alcohol production in the 
city because of fire safety reasons, the lower taxes outside of the city and the available 
infrastructure – the  road  of  national  significance  was  constructed  in  1770s  and  went 
through the village, and in 1869, the railroad Lviv – Brody with Pidzamche station. It 
was a part of booming industries in the area, mostly oriented towards processing of 
agricultural products, Baczewski alcohol factory being one of the most well-known  in 
the Habsburg Empire. The first known mention of the building on Kronik’s plot is from 
1850 land cadastre, and in 1872 another production building was added next to it. The 
year 1872 is also mentioned on the label as a start of production of rums and rosolios 
at the alcohol factory of Joseph Kronik (the grandson of Moses), see picture 1.

Somewhere  around  the  same  time  the  synagogue  was  constructed  in  the 
neighboring  plot  (it did not  survived  until  today). Some researchers, such as Roman 
Mohytych, also suppose that the neo-Gothic tower was added into the building later, 
supposedly in 1908, after the fire in the building. Another somewhat similar tower is 
also located on the building just next to the customs checkpoint at Lychakiv road, so 
this stylish addition could be interpreted as a mark of the symbolical gateway to the 
city. On  the  other  hand,  the  romantic  and  historicist  style  of  the  building  could  be 
interpreted as an advertisement of the enterprise and a sign of the upward mobility of 
the Jewish family, which grew from small local entrepreneurs to higher bourgeois and 
literate class. As an indicator of this social and professional advancement, the “Kronik 
and son” enterprise received a privilege to deliver to the court of the Austrian-Hungarian 
empire (K&K Hoflieferand status) in 1912.  
Jewish owners of the factory were active members of the local Jewish community 
and generously donated for the establishment of local synagogue, hospital, and Jewish 
cemetery. In  the  interwar  period,  the  next  in the  owner’s  dynasty,  Moritz  Kronik, 
donated also for the colonizers of Palestine, thus signaling about his political views. The 
enterprise  produced  spirits  and  traded  vines,  first  imported  from  Hungary,  and  later 
from  Palestine.  Before  gaining  the  full  ownership  of  the  factory  (1926),  Moritz  lived 
mainly  in  Vienna  where  he  managed  his  own  chemical  firm.  Kronik  family  members 
were  traveling  between  Lviv  and  Vienna in  the  interwar  period. The  enterprise 
developed quite well in this time, as a part of lively industrial and multinational (and 
especially Jewish) part of the city (see picture 2).

The  Second  World  War  put  a  tragic  end  to  the  Kroniks  dynasty  in  Lviv.  No 
testimonies on exact history of the factory in this period were found, but it is known 
that all the Jews were resettled to the Lviv ghetto in November – December 1941, and 
later  died both on  site and  in  the  neighboring  village  Lysynychi  killing  site, or  were 
deported, mostly to death camp in Belzec. The factory itself was located outside the 
ghetto. Part of Kronik family members also died in Warsaw, and in the death camps of 
Teresienstadt and Auschwitz. 
After the end of the war, Lviv became the part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist 
Republic, and all the enterprises, including small and medium, were nationalized. The 
trust  “Ukrholovvyno”  (“All-Ukrainian  Vine  Trust”)  became  the  administrative  force 
responsible for the building, and the factory continued as a site for production, as well 
as distribution of the imported vines from Moldova and Alger. The romantic look of the 
building inspired photographers also in the Soviet period (see picture 3).

In  1970s,  the  building  functioned  as  a  vegetable  processing unit,  where  the 
vegetable preserves, jams, honeys, and mushrooms were made and sold in the small 
adjacent shop. In comparison to the other big plants and factories, developed as a part 
of  Soviet  industrialization  of  Lviv,  especially  numerous  at  Pidzamche,  the  vegetable 
processing base  was  a  tiny  enterprise,  with  smaller  salaries,  which  stood  somehow 
outside the mainstream “industrial pride of giant plants” discourse. In some periods, 
the salaries were paid by the vegetable products which later were used in the informal 
exchange  practices  at  the  market  located  nearby;  also,  some  half-rotten  or  fresh 
vegetables were given to the workers as a bonus which was an advantage in the deficit 
economy. Importantly, the factory’s workers, many of them female but also male, were 
commuting  to  work  from  the  villages  around  Lviv,  thus  continuing  the  story  of  the 
factory as a point of connection between the city and agricultural vicinity. The products 
were  sent  to many destinations in  the  USSR,  including western  and  central Ukraine, 
Moscow, Far East, Belarus etc.  The  main  building  was  declared a monument of local 
significance in 1990. 
After 1991, the period of economy restructuring started, and in the late 1990s 
the factory was reorganized into the company “Vitacons” which continued to produce 
jams and vegetable preserves. In 2008, the production stopped on site, and the building 
was sold to Oleksiy Kurylyshyn, private owner and real estate developer from Lviv, who 
was interested in the adaptive reuse of the building but had no sufficient funds to cover 
the renovations. Instead he allowed different grass-root cultural initiatives to have their 
events in the building. From among most important there were Contemporary Art Week 
(from 2008) and Lviv Fashion Week, theatre performances, Urban Exploration Fest (see 
also Prokopenko 2015; Jam Factory 2019).

After the decline of the industrial production in the post-Soviet period, the district 
of Pidzamche where the complex is situated gradually became perceived as neglected 
part of the city, physically isolated by the railway and located (mentally) far away from 
the touristically attractive downtown. The district is a very rich heritage area, but many 
buildings  are  deteriorating  because  of  the  lack  of  maintenance.  A  number  of  post-
industrial  buildings  in  this  formerly  industrial and  multinational  area  of  the  city  are 
waiting for revitalization or demolition and redevelopment, as it happened in other parts 
of Lviv. 
4  The initiative 
In 2015, Dr. Harald Binder, professional historian and cultural entrepreneur from 
Vienna, bought  the building  with  the  idea  to  develop a  revitalization project  for  the 
future art center. By that moment Dr. Binder had been a well-known public figure in 
Lviv  and  Ukraine,  primarily  because  of the  Center  for Urban  History  of  East  Central 
Europe founded by him in Lviv in 2004. The Center acts as a research and public history 
institution which engages different audiences in dialogue on unknown and challenging 
aspects of the past and serves as a space for discussions on urban and cultural policies. 
It  is  also  a  successful  case  of  adaptive  reuse  of  the  historical  resident  building  at 
Bohomoltsia  Str.  into an office,  exhibition  space, accommodation  for  the  research 
fellows, conference  hall,  and  café.  Having  this  background,  Dr.  Binder  decided  to 
develop  a  new  project,  this  time  more  challenging  one,  serving for  the  critical 
reassessment of contemporary Ukrainian and international art, and combining research, 
art  production,  and  educational  programs.  His  idea  was  supported  by  Bozhena 
Zakaliuzhna, cultural  manager  and independent  art  activist who  has been  previously 
engaged in the temporary uses of the site.

The  motivation  behind  the  decision  to  purchase  the  site  and  to  start  the 
revitalization project was multifold. First of all, due to the temporary uses in 2008-2014, 
the site firmly became associated with the idea of the art center. The previous owner, 
Oleksiy Kurylyshyn, positioned it as a revitalization project, but had no sufficient funds 
to cover the renovation, especially after the major economy crisis of 2008-2009. The 
very  name  of  “Jam  Factory”  was  invented  by  temporary  users  and  became  common 
among  Lviv  residents.  The  building  was  also  mentioned  in  the  media  as  a  place  of 
cultural life, “second life” of the factory. Bozhena Zakaliuzhna, who was involved in the 
temporary  uses  of  the  site,  also  contributed  to  the  promotion  of the idea  of  the  art 
center   in   the   building,   especially   by   organizing   the   international workshop 
“Regeneration  of  Industrial  Buildings  in  Ukraine” in  2014,  where  the  invited  experts 
shared their experience and also drafted some ideas for the Jam Factory. 
Secondly, the  start  of  another  project  in  Lviv  was seen  by  Harald  Binder  as 
reasonable because there is no other institution of contemporary art in the city and few 
of them in Ukraine, and its possible impact could be much bigger than, for example, 
another  art  center  in  Vienna (Bozhena  Zakaliuzhna  2018). What  made  this  project 
especially ambitious was the location of the building in the historically rich district, but 
also  district  perceived  as  depressive  and  postindustrial.  This  initiative  differed 
significantly  from  the  very  common  strategy  of  the  investors  to  redevelop  historical 
properties in the downtown Lviv, the closer to the Market Square, the better. The idea 
of the Jam Factory as being a trigger of revitalization of Pidzamche has been already 
present in the discourse, but no one took practical steps to implement it. 
“Neighborhood development and extending of the imagined boundaries outwards 
the city center to the areas which are not included, and in many minds, are peripheral. 
It is not only periphery in territorial sense, but also in a social sense, for many. And 
that gives it [the Jam Factory project] this special touch” (Harald Binder 2019). 
 Importantly, the amount of investment to realize the revitalization project in Lviv 
is still significantly lower than in Vienna. Thirdly, the very building of the factory looked 
inspiring and very suitable for the art center, also because of its paradoxical combination 
of decorative neo-gothic style and former industrial function (picture 5). 
“The  encounter  with  the  building,  I  think,  is  a  very  good  term,  because  it  is 
something which is essential in such a project – how do you relate to the object where 
you want to do something. It was on the market for sale, and I was introduced to the 
owner, and I was fascinated by this extraordinary strangeness of this Neo-Gothic style 
of  the  building  in  half  decay  in  the  district  of  the  city  which  was  not  in  my  focus  of 
everyday experience... So, I saw this building and I found that it screams that someone 
does something with it. And I immediately thought that it would be a great place for a 
cultural centre. Obviously, it is a “western” tradition of industrial sites transforming into 
cultural spaces” (Harald Binder 2019).

5  Activities 
“A lot of very cool projects which people poured vast sums of money into failed 
for the reason that people were bound to the building, not to the institution. They made 
a  beautiful  building,  they  created  the  whole  infrastructure  in  the  best  way  but  had 
nothing to fill it with... That's why, now paying attention to creating institution is the 
main task for me.” (Bozhena Zakaliuzhna 2018-2019). 
In  2015-2017,  the  Jam  Factory  Art  Center  existed  rather  as  an  architectural 
project, and in 2018 the team became much more concerned with institution building. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  2017, Bozhena  Zakaliuzhna, as  a director  of  the  Jam  Factory, prepared  a 
strategic roadmap on provisionary activities in a situation of delay with renovation of 
Starting   the   development   of   the   renovation   project   without   a   definite 
programme  was  a part  of longer process of  searching  for  the  identity  of  the 
future Center. The institutions of contemporary art are few in Ukraine and non-
existent  in  Lviv.  Therefore  it  was  important  to  have  the  period  of  creative 
improvising about the future and brainstorming with different specialists who 
were  invited  to  give  advice.  The  Stefan  Rindler  bureau  initially  thought  of  a 
contemporary art museum, but in the process of discussions, the concept of the 
institution evolved into the “Center” which is not so much focused on collections 
but on public programs. Obviously, this searching for identity also contributed 
into the delays in the project timeline.

the buildings. As a result, the activities of the Center started much 
earlier than the actual renovation works. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
From 2017, it became clear that the Center will not be a kind of gallery collecting 
and representing most fashionable and expensive international art pieces, as it is the 
case,  for  example,  with Pinchuk  Art  Center in  Kyiv,  which  is  oriented  towards 
international  fashion  and  much  less  rooted  into the local  context.  It  is  impossible 
because of financial reasons, but also because this kind of “rootlessness” is criticized in 
Ukraine.  Instead,  the  Jam  Factory  is  seen  as  an  institution  combining  research, 
education, and production of contemporary art, in international cooperation, but with 
focus on local context and needs of local publics. 
The most important activities in 2017-2019 were: 
Communication with   the   residents   and   broader   audiences   about the 
architectural project and the initiative. 
Research. The  information  on  the  history  of  the  building,  its  owners  and 
production was initially very scarce. There are still many undiscovered parts of it – not 
only related to the distant past, but also in the post-war decades and post-1991 period, 
when  the  building  was  privatized  and  radical  economic  transformations  started. The 
historical research was carried out in the archives and libraries of Lviv, Kyiv, Warsaw, 
and Vienna. To learn more about the Soviet and post-Soviet periods and to engage the 
local residents and former employees of the Jam Factory, the oral history and mapping 
project  ''Tell  Your  Story'' was  launched. Students from  the  universities were  also 
involved as part of their educational activities.  
Working with the neighbourhood – in 2017-2019, there were several partner 
projects   with   contemporary   artists,   including   those for   children   living   in   the 
neighbourhood. The artists supported  by  the  SWAP,  British-Ukrainian  exchange 
program,  are  coming  annually  to  Jam  Factory as  visiting  fellows  and  develop their 
projects, also in cooperation with the locals. One of such projects is Dana Venecia’s film 
project which involved children from Pidzamche as actors (see picture 6). 
Testing  uses  before  the  renovation  became one of  the  tools for  the  Jam  Factory 
team. Initially thinking of the future Center as an art cluster with several resident 
organizations and independent artists, the Jam Factory team invited other actors 
to  have  their  events  in  the  temporary  building,  in  many  cases  for  free.  In  the 
process  the  team  came  to  the  idea  that  to  implement  its  aim  of  promotion  and 
stronger  public  outreach  of  contemporary  art,  the  single  institution  with  strong 
educational  agenda  is  more  relevant  for  the  local  context  than  just  a  cluster  of 
independent actors with their own agendas.

Building partnerships in Ukraine and internationally was very helpful in terms 
of gradual development of the institutional design and becoming more self-aware. In 
2018,  several  applications  were submitted for international partnerships  and joint 
projects. Jam Factory also became a member of the Trans Europe Halles network. 
“Ukraine  became  a  focus  of  interest  more  after  2014  [the  Maidan 
Revolution]. We stopped being some kind of blank space for many organizations 
because we started talking about ourselves in a different way. This self-awareness, 
this change, this feeling that we as people living in this country have to change 
and stop waiting that someone from the top will change it for us. This awareness... 
of  democratic  transformations  won't  be  made  down  from  the  top,  only  bottom-
up... And this understanding that we can change something, it affects people from 
other countries, and it gets interesting... A lot of people understand that they will 
reinforce and make their influence felt with the help of that cooperation” (Bozhena 
Zakaliuzhna 2018). 
Infopoint (temporary building for the educational activities and presentations) 
was renovated in 2017. Cultural events started there, and the building was also rented 
(in many cases for free) to other cultural initiatives. The main aim of these activities is 
a gradual change in the neighborhood and more sensitive and organic development. 
Harald Binder Cultural Enterprises annual grant program started in 2018, 
with  Jam  Factory  team  as  an  operator. The  non-governmental  organizations  from 
Ukraine and abroad are encouraged to apply with art and educational projects. 
“This is a way of building partnerships and to support both beginners and those 
having already a name. It is also a way to see how other institutions work, what these 
institutions  are  in  whole Ukraine  and abroad... For  us,  it is a  chance  to  try  different 
formats and search for priorities” (Bozhena Zakaliuzhna 2019).

Educational events and educational theatre program Black Box started in 
2018.  It  grew  out  of  the  feeling  that  there  is  a great  lack of  understanding  what 
contemporary  art  is  in  Ukrainian  context. The  state-supported  cultural  institutions 
remain quite conservative and closed environments, as well as the educational system 
for  creative  arts.  The  contemporary  Ukrainian  artists  are  much  more  known  in  the 
“west” and are not fully a part of the local context. Therefore the educational programs 
for children and adults are priority, so this situation could be gradually and organically 
changed. 
The Black  box is a lecture  and  practical  program, which  includes  lectures, 
discussions and  workshops with  professionals from  different  Ukrainian  regions – 
Kharkiv, Kyiv, Lviv - and international specialists. The lecture program is public and free

in contemporary art or theater and are ready to work deeper. 
Exhibitions. In October and November 2019, the first exhibitions were hosted 
in the temporary exhibition and event space at Mekhanichna Str. (renovated in 2019 
especially for this temporary use).

“Naturally, there were pretty many different mistakes but it's so important that 
we have an opportunity to have them before the institution opening. This period is so 
important because we  try,  think  something  through, set  certain  tasks  and start  to 
implement them...  Needless  to  say,  we are  very  eager  to  plan and  open  exhibitions, 
invite and work with contemporary curators and so on right away. However, this time 
when we had some smaller projects in a smaller number was very significant” (Bozhena 
Zakaliuzhna 2019).

“This is a European manner in project development: not 3 weeks of planning and 
start of construction, but to linger over it for two years!... How Harald [Binder] reflects 
himself over the scenarios of the future use, what kind of experts he invites, how he 
changes his mind, how he changes the project requirements! There was a big polemics 
at the consultative council, because there is a factory [monument] building and a new 
building. And the council was quarreling over the façades. And the Austrian [architect] 
Stefan Rindler proposed to add the cube [building] there instead of the building which 
is not a monument. And the activists started to shout that “it is absurd, it is impossible, 
you go too far!”... And I think this is a great case, a separate book should be written 
about how many people were involved, how they thought, what discussions were there. 
And this, in fact, small building can become a methodological guide for the revitalization 
of other objects. We should bring there all the rich oligarchs and show them: look, it is 
not a posh restaurant with sharks, but culture, media, library, actors and artists” (Yulian 
Chaplinskyi 2019). 
The main building of the Jam Factory was bought by Harald Binder in 2015, but 
this was only the first step in consolidating 6 adjacent plots with other factory buildings 
owned by different legal entities which took two additional years (Kateryna Kovalchuk 
2019). In general, the chaotic situation with land cadaster and low quality of the land 
use documents in a pressing issue in Ukraine.

One of the complicated issues in the process of adaptive reuse in Ukraine is very 
personalized approach among the officials, when the decisions could be taken on the 
basis of personal relations, tastes, and some hidden personal agendas: 
“This is very hard to understand from the  European perspective, because here 
things  are  just  different  and  sometimes  things  which  seem  to  be  very  complicated, 
suddenly are just resolved, because somebody was hired for a position and just said 
how it's gonna be, and another person is not that important. Or things which seem to 
be  very  easy  somehow  become  very  complicated  (laughs)  and  we  don't  understand 
why... That is a problem here that processes, which should be easy, sometimes become 
complicated because either it is overregulated or there are people sitting somewhere 
who just obstruct it” (Harald Binder 2019). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While the plots were consolidating in 2015-2017,  the  architectural project was 
gradually developed. First there was a closed competition among 5 bureaus selected by 
Harald  Binder  and  Bozhena  Zakaliuzhna on  the  basis  of  professional  advice.  All  the 
projects were very interesting, but not any of them was completely fitting the idea and 
the place. The decision was taken to continue searching for the right approach. Finally, 
the project by Austrian bureau “Stefan Rindler” was selected as a basis – “most  
One of the major challenges for the project is the inefficiency of bureaucracy 
and  absence  of  established  schemes  of  adaptive  reuse.  More  traditional 
restoration projects which adapt historical buildings into hotels and restaurants 
are common in Lviv, but not the revitalization of the complex of buildings and 
plots  with  addition  of  the  new  buildings  next  to  historical  monuments.  The 
solution of the Jam Factory team was to strictly follow all the official rules and 
to  promote  the  understanding  of  importance  of  the  project  for  the  city.  No 
informal  connections,  very  common  for  the  local  context,  were  used.  Good 
reputation of Harald Binder and his previous projects in Lviv, media coverage 
and acknowledgement of the Jam Factory project among the urban activists in 
Ukraine, as well as positive attitude from the municipality, were helpful for going 
through  the  bureaucratic  procedures.  But  in  spite  of  this,  adaptation  of  the 
project  to  local  conditions  and  getting  permissions  took  much  longer  than 
initially expected. 
In many adaptive reuse and industrial zones revitalization projects in Ukraine 
the major  challenge is  the  legal  status  of  the  land  plots.  In  the  official 
documents, the adjacent plots can have different and not coinciding borders, 
and  unclear  ownership;  many plots are  under  court  investigations, also as  a 
result of shadow practices of privatization in the post-Soviet period. The State 
Land Registry is not complete and not publicly accessible, and was a subject of 
corrupt manipulations in the past. Therefore, the work of lawyers is long and 
demanding.

interesting   decision,   probably   the   most   challenging,   combining   modern 
architecture and the old” (Zakaliuzhna 2018). However, it turned out it is impossible to 
fully implement the Austrian project in the Ukrainian conditions because of too different 
building regulations. Therefore, the local bureau “AVR Development” was contracted to 
cooperate with the Austrian side. 
There are 3 most important functions in the future complex: exhibition, theatre, 
and public zone with commercial function (restaurant) (see picture 9). 
 
Picture 9. Plan of the future Jam Factory Art Center. 
 
These  spaces  are  planned  as  flexible  and  adaptable  for  very  different  projects 
and needs. All the buildings are connected by the basement level into one complex, and 
different technical and engineering communications will be located there. One of the 
advantages of the historical complex is a comfortable and human-scale courtyard which 
is inviting and will be used for events as well. The neo-Gothic tower will have a rather 
limited use because in accordance with the regulations it is too narrow to organize a 
public space there. 
When  the  building  was  bought  it  has  been  already  in  quite  a  deteriorated 
condition, and necessary works were done to fix the most important things and prevent 
further decline. But major works on the historical monuments will be quite complicated: 
the  foundation  and  the basic  structure  of  the  building should be reinforced using  the 
special  technology  of  injections into  the  historical  material  of  the  walls.  The façades 
facing the main street (Khmelnytsky Str.) are under threat of collapse, but they should 
be preserved completely  and  require  especially  sensitive  approach,  and  the team  of 
specialists will be needed to work with this. The special research was done to figure out 
what  kind  of  materials  were  used  in  the  building,  and  it  is  planned  that  respective 
materials – plaster and tiles - will be produced from natural components to restore the 
façade.  The  historical wooden  steps  will  be  preserved  and  restored  as  well.  In  the 
exhibition space, some internal walls will be removed to make the space bigger, but the 
historical walls will be marked on the floors, and the hints of the walls will remain in

place so the building could be read as historical. There should be also digital tools to 
help the visitor to “read” the historical building (Kateryna Kovalchuk 2019). 
In 2018, the first permission was received from among the “city-planning terms 
and limitations”. It means the general acceptance of the project by the municipality. In 
order to apply further to get other permissions for the construction start, it is necessary 
to  meet  so  called  technical  specifications.  Since  January  2019, the  team  has begun 
submitting requests for these technical specifications (from the companies dealing with 
lightning, electricity, gas, water, drainage and sewage). These are private enterprises 
with a very small share of public sector, and at the same time very complex monopolistic 
structures  which  try  to  get  as  many  financial  resources  as  possible.  Therefore  the 
negotiations with them are not easy. As the stage of meeting technical specifications is 
almost finished, the team is going to sign an agreement with the architectural bureau 
“AVR Development” basically on the practical implementation of the project. In April 
2020, the general contractor is to be selected and an agreement signed. Therefore, the 
main construction  process  will start no  earlier  than summer 2020. But  the  first 
preparatory activities have already started on site in October 2019. 
Practically, the process of getting permissions and legal documents for the site 
turned  out  to  be  very  slow  and  complicated,  but  the  project  is developing  in  quite  a 
gradual and “organic” way, trying to set the example of the adaptive reuse which is not 
engaged in any informal deals with the officials and services and creates new practices 
of transparent development and communication. 
“I  see  it  has  a  chance  to  test  the Ukrainian  ability  to  do  something  efficiently 
without bribery” (Harald Binder 2019). 
 
7  Heritage 
The Jam Factory complex consists of several buildings from different epochs. The 
oldest one, from mid-XIX century, is the main building in Neo-Gothic style which is a 
listed monument of local significance. Some buildings are from the interwar period, and 
some from the Soviet epoch. Because of the close proximity to the listed monument, 
the limits on the height of the new buildings (23.6 m) apply to the project and a special 
“historical and urban planning feasibility study” had to be approved.

Harald  Binder,  being  a  professional  historian  himself, and several  other 
researchers - historians Yevhen Poliakov and Joseph Gelston and architectural historian 
Roman Mohytych, developed a multi-layered understanding  of  the heritage  values  of 
the  complex. Firstly,  the  architectural  heritage  values  are  defined  by  the  neo-Gothic 
stile  applied  to  the  industrial  building which  is  a  unique  case  for  Lviv.  Secondly,  the 
building is a witness of the industrial boom and rapid growth of population in the second 
half of  the  19
th
 century,  when  the  district performed  production and  transportation 
functions,  and  served  as  a  link  to  agricultural  areas,  with  its  numerous distilleries 
processing  grain  into  different  types  of alcoholic  beverages. Thirdly,  the  enterprise 
represents the multinational history of Lviv, and the history of the Jewish family of the 
owners is a part of bigger history of Jewish businesses thriving in the Habsburg Empire 
and interwar period, also with broad connections to other geographical localities. The 
disruption of the family history in the Holocaust is also a part of dark heritage of Europe 
in the XX century, as well as the silencing and non-remembering of the factory’s past 
and Jewish ownership in the Soviet period. Fourthly, the living memories of those who 
worked at the factory in Soviet period are also part of intangible heritage, revived in 
the oral history and mental mapping project “Tell Your Story”. Fifthly, the temporary 
uses of the factory after the end of production and before the purchase of the building 
in  2015  is  another  heritage  layer  because  it  is  connected  to  the  development  of 
independent art initiatives in Lviv, such as Contemporary Art Week which resulted in 
many further fruitful initiatives. 
With  so many  heritage  layers,  it was  not easy  to  decide  how  to  harmoniously 
develop  the  complex. One  of  challenges  is  that  the  exact  uses  of some plots  and 
buildings are not  known,  because too  few  documents  have  survived.  Especially 
disruptive was the Second World War, with tremendous change of population not only 
due to the Holocaust, but also because of the postwar population exchanges (including 
resettlement of Poles to Poland in its new borders and influx of Ukrainians from other 
regions of Ukraine and from  the  Lviv  rural vicinity;  see  more  in  Amar  2015). Being a 
small industrial complex, it did not get any attention from the historians in the Soviet 
period, and, as far as we know, there was no company museum or cultural center to

take care of its history documentation, on the contrary to bigger enterprises. On the 
other hand, due to this smaller scale of the complex and the character of production 
(no heavy industry and no contamination of the site) the buildings were relatively well 
preserved  up  to  2008.  After  that,  unfortunately,  the  buildings  started  to  quickly 
deteriorate because they stood vacant (Kateryna Kovalchuk 2019). Another challenge 
of the adaptive reuse of the industrial building as an art center is the need to maximize 
the  adaptability  of  the  premises  for  the  variety  of  different  uses,  such  as  exhibition 
space,  theatre  and  performance,  workshops,  offices,  and  event  halls.  The  project  is 
aimed at preservation of the structure of the whole complex, which is nicely arranged 
around the comfortable courtyard, and the use of temporary walls and moving stage 
inside the building to make the space more flexible. 
Formally, there are buildings which are considered to be not historically valuable 
and  they  could  be  demolished.  Several  specialists  advised  to  demolish  some  non-
monuments facing the main street (Khmelnytsky Str., formerly Zolkiewska) in order to 
make a radical statement about the new function of the building as a contemporary art 
center. But after a longer reflection Harald Binder took a decision not to demolish them 
because they are uniting two other monuments and are perceived as one complex in 
mind of the local people. Importantly, this decision is also taken in a situation where 
objects from imperial period, especially decorated historicist buildings, are prioritized 
as valuable heritage, whereas modernist heritage from Polish and Soviet periods is in 
many cases neglected. For Binder, it was important to challenge this traditional division 
and to demonstrate more delicate approach. The new “black box” building will be added 
from another side and will be facing the back street and not the main street. Personally 
for Harald Binder, it is important to develop the understanding of heritage that includes 
the opinion of the local residents and those who can be called a “heritage community” 
(those who had connections to the site in the past, either former factory workers or 
artists and activists). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In Ukraine, the understanding of heritage is still very much expert-centered: there 
are officially recognized criteria of a “monument” in the legislation, and the opinion 
of  the community  is most  often not  so  crucial.  For  the  Jam  Factory  project,  it  is 
important  that  the  listed  and  non-listed  buildings  facing  the  main  street  are 
perceived as one complex by the community. Therefore they are left intact, in spite 
of the advice of professional architects.

Two monument buildings  of  the  complex  will  undergo  restoration,  and  other 
buildings – reconstruction, and a new “black box” building will be added (see pictures 
11 and 12). Also, Binder is the owner of the plot which is behind the complex and where 
the synagogue had been located. There is no clear project of the use of this adjacent 
territory, but one of the main ideas is to mark symbolically the plan of the non-existing 
synagogue.  As  one  of  the  first  temporary marks, in  October  2018, the  artist Taras 
Pastushchuk made a performance on that spot, marking the plan of the synagogue by 
salt and quoting the Bible (Ackermann 2018).

“The practice of our Lviv architects is that you always can find some means to 
build [on the monument], to add an extension and so on. But our bureau from the very 
beginning understood this is not our way. Our way is to maximize the delicateness of 
approach to what is already there” (Kateryna Kovalchuk 2019). 
8  Regulations and policies 
The national regulations and legal framework of the adaptive reuse in Ukraine is 
quite complicated and cannot be called enabling and supportive for the adaptive reuse 
projects.  In  general,  the  heritage  protection,  urban  revitalization,  and  creative 
industries  are  different  spheres  and  there  is  no comprehensive  strategy  of  their 
interrelated  development.  After  1991,  there  were  no  national  programs  of  heritage 
revitalization  in  Ukraine.  One  of  the  major  problems  is  absence  of  the  strict  vertical 
system  of  heritage  protection  and  unclear  division  of  responsibilities  between  the 
Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Regional Development and Territories, as well as lack 
of trained cadres on the national and local levels. The heritage protection in general is 
understaffed and underfunded. In its essential approaches, the Heritage Protection Law 
is oriented towards conservation of heritage, with emphasis on its material aspect, and 
not towards adaptive reuse and revitalization. The approval of the Ministry of Culture is 
needed also in case of listing the local monuments, such as Jam Factory building, but 
the Ministry has no capacity to process the documents quickly and efficiently, and in 
many cases does not react to the reported cases of damage or threat, but also makes 
the  development  impossible  because  of  centralized  bureaucracy.  Therefore, many 
specialists are sure some kind of decentralization is needed in this sphere, and the local 
monuments  are  to  be  given solely under  management  of  local  heritage  protection 
organs, similarly to Polish model: 
 
“You [the Ministry] have to get your priorities straight. You have to pick national 
landmarks,  the  most  important  landmarks  in  Ukraine,  national  treasure,  and  worry 
about those exclusively. The rest, hand it over to local bodies. Don't worry that people 
will  ruin  them,  because  people  aren't  stupid:  these  are  their  treasures” (Lilia 
Onyshchenko 2018). 
 
In fact, the decentralization reform in Ukraine is under way now, and many local 
communities already identified heritage as the backbone of their economic and cultural 
development. Much more funding now is accumulated on the local level, thus giving a 
chance for better heritage management.  
Also, some national institutions and services related to adaptive reuse (such as 
those  dealing  with  building  regulations,  fire  safety,  land cadastre,  labor  rights 
protection) are very slow in processing documents, require much time and effort, and 
are perceived as engaged in corruptive activity. The building code is very outdated and 
prevents from implementing innovative solutions in the buildings, and now the need to 
change it is much discussed in Ukraine. The Jam Factory project initially was intended 
to  be  completed  in  2018,  but  now it  is  planned  only  for  2021 – among other things, 
because  of  the delays  in  documents  processing (especially   in   the   process   of 
consolidation of the land plot consisting of 6 different parts owned by different owners).

As for  the  municipal  level policies,  in  general  the 
municipal officials are very supportive for the Jam Factory project 
and often  mention  it  in  media  as  a  positive  example. In  contrast  to  other  cities  in 
Ukraine,  Lviv  is  strictly  oriented  towards  service  economy,  and  successful  HoReCa 
projects are creating the image of the city in Ukraine and internationally. Starting from 
2008,  the  city  is  following  the  strategy  of  prioritizing  of  tourism  (especially  heritage 
tourism), IT and creative industries as pillars of the local economy. The Department of 
the  Protection  of  Historical  Environment  is  attached  to  the  Department  of  Urban 
Development and has qualified staff, positively oriented towards adaptive reuse, quite 
open-minded  and  cooperative.  In  the  last  years,  they  managed  to  gain  positive 
reputation and communicate proactively with the monuments’ owners. In general, Lviv 
seems to be quite special in comparison to other cities in Ukraine because in this city 
heritage is understood as priority, both for business class and municipality. 
The officials in Lviv are quite helpful in solving particular problems and explaining 
of existing regulations. 
 
“I’ve  heard  that  he [the  city  mayor  Andriy  Sadovyi]  has,  from  his  side, 
encouraged things to go, he is supporting personally this project... The same with the 
city architect [Yulian Chaplinskyi], he is also involved. We are in contact, so he also 
tries to help. We had a person dedicated specifically to the project in the city council, 
which was also helpful... [but] not everything depends also on the city” (Harald Binder 
2019). 
 
However, it is important to mention that beyond the personal positive attitude to 
the  project by  the  key  officials and  very  good  reputation of  Jam  Factory in  the  city, 
there are many deficiencies in the urban policies of Lviv and there are no clear rules or 
established routes to follow if one is interested in revitalization of the historical building. 
What  is  present  is  rather  several  pilot  programs  and  attempts  aimed  at  heritage 
revitalization,  participatory  planning  and community  engagement,  but  the  complex 
revitalization of historical heritage and especially industrial zones still remains the task 
for the future. The development of the city is still quite chaotic, and private investors in 
many cases are acting much more proactively then the municipality. The Master Plan of 
Lviv from 2008 is very outdated and was developed mostly by experts, without much 
public discussion and stakeholder integration. 
One of the few attempts to deal in comprehensive way with the revitalization of 
the  industrial  zones  of  Lviv  took place  in  2017-2018.  Back  then,  the IT Department, 
inspired by the  urban activists,  decided  to promote the revitalization of 15 industrial 
zones  and  objects  (mostly  those  neglected  but  also  some  developing,  such  as  Jam 
Factory and Lem Station) as future creative clusters (Viktoria Olishevska 2019). The 
municipality started  documentation  of  their  condition and  negotiations  with  their 
owners. It turned out that only one land plot is in the municipal ownership - former XIX-
century  tram  depo  where  the  initiative  of  “creative  district”  called Lem  Station is 
successfully  developing  now,  after  the  municipality  rented  it  to  the  group  of  private 
investors for 50 years. All other plots turned out to be private, and in the most cases 
the owners  were  not  cooperative  and  reluctant  about  the  creative  industries  and 
revitalization. The specific culture of privatism – the concentration of power in hands of 
the owner and lack of cooperation and even a dialogue – is very widespread problem in 
Ukraine:

“We  proposed  [to  the  owner  of  the  “Rema”  factory]:  let’s  create  some  joint 
management  organ...,  maybe  you  will  share  the  part  of  responsibility  with  us,  and 
maybe  some  rights  to  decide  on  things. But  no one  is  going  to share  their  private 
property [in Ukraine] – we clearly understood this” (Viktoria Olishevska 2019). 
 
By 2019, many of the industrial zones mentioned in this municipal initiative, have 
been  already  built  up  by  very  conventional  high-rise  commercial  housing, with  no 
preservation of industrial heritage. Even though there are creative communities in some 
of the buildings, welcomed by the owners (such as grass-root creative industries NGO 
uniting several dozens of small businesses called Re:Zavod at former “Rema” factory 
(see Vitaliy Kuryliv 2019; Krasovska 2017), most often there are no major renovation 
works and creative people have no clear status or contract with the buildings’ owners. 
So  this  initiative  of  the  municipality  had  only  limited  impact,  namely,  stimulation  of 
public  discussions  on revitalization, and  promotion  for  the  promising  and  already 
developing projects  like  Jam  Factory  and Lem  Station. As  for  the  Lem  Station,  it is 
important to mention that it is the only case of successful public-private partnership in 
adaptive reuse in Lviv, and it will partially start functioning in 2 years and fully in 4 
years, at least in accordance with the plan. 
It  is  also  notable that  the  Lviv  municipality  is  definitely  among  the  leaders  in 
Ukraine in the international cooperation, also in the sphere of urban policies, and several 
international programs significantly impacted the development of the Pidzamche district 
as well. 
In  2011, the  “Program  of  Revitalization  Lviv-Pidzamche  2012-2025”  was 
developed (mostly  by  researchers) from Krakow (Institute  of Urban and  Regional 
Development) and  Lviv (City  Institute - research,  planning  and  advisory  institution 
attached to the municipality). In accordance with the program, special accent is made 
on  architectural  heritage  as  driver  of  tourist  development  and  service-oriented 
economy,  and  reuse  of  old  buildings  next  to  construction  of  new  housing  and  office 
spaces. One of the central ideas is “contemporary authenticity” – Pidzamche as being 
most “atmospheric” and “authentic” district, but its authenticity should be revitalized. 
The Jam Factory was high on the agenda of the program back in 2011 and was described 
as a place of the future “cultural and entertainment center”, but no practical steps were 
taken  by  the municipality  to  realize it in  practice. In  2013, the  grant  from  the  Polish 
Development  Aid  made  it  possible  to  start  implementing  of  some  of  the  directions 
outlined  in  the  program:  competitions  among  the  projects  for  the  renovation  of  the 
courtyards  in  historical  houses and  public  spaces,  research  and  preparation  of  the 
tourist guide along Pidzamche, and renovation of water sources and recreation spaces 
(see  more:  Jarczewski  et  al.  2013; Yaryna Melnyk  2019).  These  events  were 
implemented successfully in 2013-2014. 
This  program  significantly  activated  the local  community,  they  become  much 
more engaged into participatory planning and much more aware of the heritage values 
of the district, and the local activists continued in the frameworks of other programs, 
including  participatory  budgeting and  co-financing  of  the  renovations  of  historical 
buildings (see Yaryna Melnyk 2019). 
After   the   end   of   the   Polish   Development   Aid   project, the “Program of 
Revitalization of Pidzamche” remains important document for the municipality and City 
Institute,  but  rather  as  a  general idea/direction of  development  and  not  as  a 
comprehensive practical program  with  defined  steps  and  strict  monitoring (Yaryna 
Melnyk 2019). Some initiatives are continued in the framework of the City Institute

programs, there is some co-funding from the city for the implementation of particular 
measures  related  to  the  program,  but  the  program  is  not  implemented  as  a  whole 
(Yaryna Melnyk  2019; Oleksandr Kobzarev  2019). The  municipality  is  not  so  much 
focused  on Pidzamche heritage  revitalization  and  invests  into  more  pressing  issues 
instead, such as roads reconstruction and transport improvement. In this situation, it is 
not  the  municipality  but  other  actors  (such  as  real  estate  developers)  became  much 
more active in changing the district. 
The activists from among the locals continued to be engaged in the framework of 
another program – “Communities in Action” (conducted by the City Institute in 2015-
2017) and supported by the EU program “Neighbourhood Civil Society Facility 2012 and 
Non-State Actors and Local Authorities in Development (NSA&LA) 2012 and 2013”. In 
the  framework  of  the  project the  micro-communities  were  identified  and  engaged  in 
participatory budgeting, research on communities’ needs was done, and several small 
projects of revitalization of public places implemented. 
Another   program   of   international   cooperation,   very   important   for   the 
revitalization of Pidzamche heritage, was “Municipal Development and Rehabilitation of 
the Old City of Lviv” (2009-2018), carried out by the Lviv municipality (specifically the 
Department   of   Protection   of   the   Historical   Environment)   and  GIZ - Deutsche 
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit. This project helped to draft new plans 
of urban development and heritage revitalization, educate new generations of experts 
and practitioners for renovation works. GIZ experts act as mediators in the making of 
the dialogue between different stakeholders, such as owners, tenants, municipality, and 
investors. GIZ is especially well-known for the ordinary locals of Lviv for their program 
of co-financing the renovation of historical windows, doors, gates and courtyards in the 
residence houses, as well as for free educational events, workshops and meetings with 
the residents (see more: Off the Beaten Track 2011). This program was funded by GIZ 
and  municipality,  and  the  renovations  were  co-financed  together with  the  residents. 
After the end of the program, the Lviv municipality continues (on a smaller scale) to co-
finance the renovation of windows, doors, and gates. 
Overall,  it  is  fully  legitimate  to  underline  that  the  Jam  Factory  project  is 
developing in the situation where there are no established and systematic urban policies 
related to revitalization and adaptive reuse, but there are several successful projects, 
some  enthusiastic  heritage  community,  lively  international  cooperation,  and  positive 
personal attitude  of  the  key  members  of  the  current  mayor’s  team  to  the  ideas  of 
adaptive  reuse  and  creative  industries.  Adaptive  reuse  is  definitely  a  fashion  and  is 
present  in  public  speeches  by  the  officials,  as  well  as  in  the  communication  of  the 
residents, especially of younger generations. But every case of adaptive reuse in Lviv 
is developing mostly by the trial and error method, and the municipality does not have 
enough instruments and resources to foster adaptive reuse.

9     The economic model 
“It is some kind of mixed model between private non-profit investment, without 
expectation of return, some kind of generated income through the complex itself, and 
external funds from other institutions” (Harald Binder 2019). 
At  the  moment  the  Jam  Factory  is  looking  for  an  appropriate  business  model. 
Now  it  has  full  support  from  the  donor,  but  becoming  self-sufficient  is  one  of  the 
important tasks. The project includes a restaurant and a small bar that should bring a 
profit, as well as space lease, tickets or books. At the moment the idea is that it would 
be  good to cover  costs  of  building  maintenance out  of  all  this  income. Applying  for 
grants and fund raising via crowdfunding platforms is also planned. As Ukraine is a non-
EU  member,  the  Jam  Factory is  not  eligible  for  many  of  the  EU programs, but  it  can 
apply in partnership with other institutions in the EU countries. The Jam Factory has 
already applied  for  the  support  from Swedish  Institute (European  Commission)  and 
Visegrad Fund in cooperation with other institutions from the EU. 
 
10 Governance and community 
Initially, the Jam Factory developed as a private initiative. Dr. Harald Binder and 
Bozhena Zakaliuzhna are the core team who are responsible for drafting the idea and 
the strategic roadmap both for the institutional development and adaptive reuse of the 
site. Till  2018,  most tasks were  outsourced to  the  temporary  engaged  specialists: 
accounting,  land  issues,  detailed  plan, law expertise, land  surveying documentation, 
and architectural project design. 
In  2018,  the  Jam  Factory  started  to move from  the  stage  of  giving  all  the 
processes to a contractor to the stage of having a regular team. 2 project managers 
were hired in 2018 (one of them still working - Bohdan Hrytsiuk who worked with ''Tell 
Your Story'' and with other local projects, he has a theatre background), from 2019 - 
visual  art  manager Oksana Karpovets who had previously worked and studied at the 
Fulbright Program in New York for three years. Communication manager position was 
announced in late 2019 as well. 
“Harald always has the last word [as for the architectural project] but he also has 
this trust and always listens to different parties. And there's Herbert Pasterk [architect 
and  designer]  who  is  looking  at  that  from  the  technical  point  of  view...  So  we  have 
corresponding discussions... Actually, Harald worships history and has his own visions. 
All  of  us  have  a  chance  to  express  our  own  opinion  but  the final  decision  belongs  to 
Harald. He always listens to everyone. This is the way the decisions are made” (Bozhena 
Zakaliuzhna 2019). 
At the moment it is planned that the team will stay small, up to 5 people, during 
the process of renovations, and after the complex will be fully launched, the team will 
become bigger, and some more formal structures of decision-making (such as advisory 
boards) will appear.

There are also volunteers engaged into some of the activities, especially bigger 
events, but they are not numerous at the moment. There is also a new idea of engaging 
interns who study and already try working. At the moment, there is one female intern 
and there may be one more in the future. They can become a part of the team later. 
11 Impact 
1. The  discussions  on  the  architectural  project  of Jam  Factory impacted 
considerably on the thinking about contemporary architecture in the historical context. 
The  discussions  at  the Lviv city  council  and gatherings  of  the Commission on 
architecture, urban planning, and protection of historical environment (especially  the 
black box as an addition to the complex of historical buildings) were heated and focused 
on possible ways of combination  of  old and  new. For  the  very  conservative  milieu  of 
professional architects and preservationists of Lviv who are very suspicious against the 
new  construction  next  to  the  monuments,  this  case  became  groundbreaking and 
contributes to changing opinions. 
2. The  Jam  Factory  team  shares  their  experience  in  Ukraine  at  forums and 
meetings  related  to  revitalization in  Ukraine  and internationally  in  the  framework  of 
Trans Europe Halles. If the first successful initiatives of adaptive reuse in Ukraine were 
almost  exclusively  commercially  oriented  and  included  only  mass  culture  events  and 
festivals (such institutions as “Art Zavod Platforma” in Kyiv and “Art Factory Mekhanika” 
in Kharkiv), now there are several initiatives with special focus on socially critical art 
and contemporary art, such as early-stage initiative Contemporary Art Center in Dnipro. 
Jam Factory was one of the first initiatives (along with the platform for cultural initiatives 
“Izolyatsia”, opened in Donetsk in the east of Ukraine in 2012) with special focus on 
socially critical art, and the references to Jam Factory are present in the narratives of 
other similar initiatives. As  Yulian  Chaplinskyi  notes,  the  Jam Factory  can  become  a 
“methodological guide” for other initiatives in Ukraine. 
3. The  previous  uses  of  Jam  Factory  building  as  a  space  for  informal  art 
initiatives  and  especially  for  the  Days  of  Contemporary  Art and  Lviv  Fashion  Week 
resulted in the idea of Pidzamche district as a future “creative hub” of Lviv which became 
a discursive cliché (Olishevska 2019). It also had some impact on the decision of the 
municipality to select the Pidzamche district for the pilot project of regeneration carried 
out in cooperation with Krakow Urban Development Institute and Lviv City Institute and 
aimed at improvement of urban management through the local residents’ participation 
and  increasing  tourist  attractiveness  of  the  district (see  more  in: Janas&Jarczewski 
2014).  
4. Even though the Jam Factory does not operate in full at the moment, still 
its  ambitions  and  public  outreach  attracted  new  investment  into  the  district  of 
Pidzamche (see Yulian Chaplynskyi  2019; Bozhena Zakaliuzhna  2018-2019; Harald 
Binder 2019). Recently the renovation of the historical house into co-housing project 
has started just next to the Jam Factory and adjacent former “Almazinstrument” factory. 
This initiative is connected to the owner of Bank Hotel – another case of adaptive reuse 
located in the downtown. The owner decided to locate his next project not in the city 
center, but next to Jam Factory.

“The  emergence  of  this  cool  architectural  and  cultural  object  always  has  an 
amazing  impact  on  the  district,  it  becomes  a  magnet  for  people  and  their  mobility” 
(Yulian Chaplinskyi 2019). 
 
Another case  in  mind,  of  much  bigger  scale, is  the  project  “Pidzamche  Town” 
recently  proposed  by  “Real”  company.  The real  estate  development  project  on  the 
territory of the former “Almazinstrument” plant will be located in close proximity to the 
Jam Factory. The plan proposes to transform the historical part of the plant (with several 
monument objects) into open public spaces and commercial public spaces, cafes and 
restaurants. On the second stage, the project proposes to connect this part of the city 
with the High Castle (hill in the downtown) with the aerial cableway. This project was 
awarded in the “Ukrainian Urban Award” competition in the category “City Planning”, 
and   the  motivation  was   “contemporary   architecture   fitting  into   historical   built 
environment, “low-rise buildings harmoniously neighboring with historical monuments”, 
“developed  infrastructure”,  and  cableway.  In  the  opinion  of  the  Lviv  chief  architect 
Yulian  Chaplynskyi, it  will  considerably improve  the  connections  and  will  break  the 
isolation of the district, and will be one of the best examples of combination of historical 
and contemporary. This location of this project and its design is obviously impacted by 
the  discussions  going  on  around  Jam  Factory  project. However,  at  the  moment  the 
“Real”  Company  only  has documents  for  land  use  of  the  plot,  but  it will require  long 
time to get other permissions, and, in fact, at the moment it is unclear how the project 
can be changed in the future and if it really will be a positive case of new development 
in  the  historical  environment. At  the  same  time,  there  are  also  other  real  estate 
initiatives, implemented earlier in the district, which are much more convenient for Lviv 
context, such as high-rise blocks with no sensitivity to the environment or decorated 
buildings of fake historicist styles. So there is an obvious impact of Jam Factory project 
on the approaches to the development of the district, but at the moment it is unclear 
to which extent the new practices will become dominating. 
 
12 The model 
Jam Factory is the only adaptive reuse initiative in Ukraine which is focused solely 
on art and education and aims at combining very different forms of contemporary art. 
This  idea  of  maximum  adaptability  of  the  space  for  different  kinds  of  visual  and 
performative arts is unique for Ukraine where still the division into disciplines is strong. 
As an institution, it combines the efforts of private foundation and NGO to pursue its 
goals. 
Most importantly, the Jam Factory is a case of gradual and “organic” development 
of the adaptive reuse project, with engagement of local community and a number of 
experts, established relations with municipality and the Department of the Protection of 
the Historical Environment. The project strictly follows all the rules and regulations and 
is very strict about non-involvement into any informal deals with the officials or services 
which is quite common in Ukrainian context. Its implementation lasts much longer than 
expected in the beginning, but it helps the team to gradually change the setting, work 
for the reputation, and implement cultural changes in the environment in a more natural 
way.

The  Jam  Factory  model  is  a  challenge  to  the  neoliberal 
discourse in the sphere of adaptive heritage reuse. This discourse 
emphasizes the financial self-sufficiency and community engagement, but is also a part 
of the gradual removal of the state and richer classes from the support of culture and 
social  sphere.  The  Jam  Factory  is  supported  by  the  private  donor  who  does  not 
necessarily  expect  the  return  of  money  and  is  motivated  by  the  possibility  to  foster 
social and cultural change.

1 Introduction 
This  observatory  case  analysis  report  presents  the  result  of  the  analysis  of  the 
project ‘Grünmetropole’. This project – implemented in the Belgian-Dutch-German 
border  region  in  2008 – aimed  at  rehabilitating  the  shared  mining  past  of  this 
region. The industrial mining past was of major influence in shaping the physical 
appearance and the social and cultural life in this region. Hence, the end of the 
mining  industry in  the  second  half  of  the  20
th
 century  created  many challenges 
concerning  the conversion  of  the  region, which  strongly  resonate  with  heritage 
management issues. The Grünmetropole project aimed at addressing these issues. 
Its  objectives  were  to  renew  the  post-industrial  landscape,  to  strengthen  the 
common identity of the region, and to create a touristic impulse. This was done by 
implementing two touristic routes along relicts of the mining past, one for cars and 
one for bicycles, connecting 72 points of interest in the region.  
1.1 The area of the Grünmetropole 
The area of the Grünmetropole stretches along a former coal basin, ranging from 
Beringen in Belgium, via Heerlen in the Netherlands, to Düren which is located in 
Germany (see Picture 2). It’s  an  urban  area  consisting  of  about  2200  square 
kilometre and about 1.6 million inhabitants (Heinrichs et al., 2008), located in the 
centre  of  North-West  Europe  in  between  several  other  metropolitan  areas:  the 
Ruhr  Metropolis  in  Germany,  the  Randstad  region  in  the  Netherlands  and  the 
Flemish  cities  (see Picture 1). It  is  a tri-national,  cross-border  area  not 
corresponding  to  any  legislative  or  governmental  institution and  without  direct 
political power. Within the same region as the area of the Grünmetropole we also 
find the  Meuse–Rhine  Euroregion,  and  the  Tri-Country  Park.  The  Euroregion 
Meuse-Rhine  is  an Euroregion  created  in  1976,  with  judicial  status  achieved  in 
1991. This transnational co-operation structure between territories located in three 
different  European  countries is  composed  of  the city-corridor  of  Aachen–
Maastricht–Hasselt–Liège (see Picture 1) and  aims  to  promote  cross-border 
cooperation  around  common  and  shared  interests.  The  Tri-Country  Park  is  the 
name  of  nature  park  in  the tri-national,  cross-border  area  which  forms  a 
connection  to  various  other  natural  area’s such  as  the  Eifel Park,  the  Ardennes, 
and the natural region Campine. The area of the Grünmetropole is however slightly 
different in terms of size and location as it for example only covers a small part of 
the Euroregion. 
Although the area of the Grünmetropole is divided by three national borders, it has 
a  strong  common denominator  in  the  industrial  mining  past.  The  presence  of  a 
major coal basin triggered a long history of mining activities (see Picture 3). Hence, 
the area of the Grünmetropole has a shared economic and cultural history based 
on winning coal as a natural resource. Yet there are differences between the three 
countries.

1.2 Conversion and restructuring 
The decrease of  coal  exploitation,  which  started  in  the  1970s, meant  de-
industrialization,  unemployment,  and  again  changed  the  socio-demographic 
characteristics  of  the  region. The  mining  regions  faced  a  difficult  physical  and 
environmental  legacy  in  the  form  of  unused  mining  shafts  and  buildings,  and 
polluted coal heaps. The  mining  regions  in all three  countries,  once  more  faced 
enormous challenges to their economic, social and environmental future. A process 
of conversion and restructuring set in. Here again we can identify differences and 
similarities  in  the  three  countries  with  regard to  the  process  of  conversion  and 
restructuring.  
 
The Netherlands 
In the Netherlands, the decision to close the mines was taken in 1965. The Dutch 
mining region in the southern part of the province of Limburg was characterized 
at that time by a pronounced monoculture in the form of the mining industry. The 
social consequences of the decision to close the mines upon those directly affected 
and upon the region can thus not be ignored (Toonen, 1972). Yet, since the mines 
were largely state owned, it was up to the Dutch government to decide about the 
mines, and they decided to adopt a policy aimed at closing all the mines as rapidly 
as possible. The reconversion policy, as outlined in Dutch government documents 
focused on several aspects (for an overview see also Toonen, 1972). Focusing on 
for instance economic measures related to retraining for miners, and measures for 
encouraging  the  establishment  of  substitute  employment (Kasper  et  al.,  2013). 
Economic conversion was done by transforming the Dutch state mines into a large 
chemical  enterprise  (DSM,  net  sales  8.6  billion  euros  in  2017) (Hassink  et  al., 
1995). Despite this focus on economic conversion, the former mining region has 
had struggles in terms of unemployment until several decades after the closing of 
the mines (Kasper et al., 2013). 
A second pillar of the conversion measures focused on branding the region in order 
to attract new employees and to keep workers and citizens in the region. For this 
goal   a   close   cooperation   between   various   governmental   bodies,   such   as 
municipalities,  and  other  organizations  such  as  the Limburg  Investment  and 
Development  Fund  (LIOF),  was  set  up.  Also  with  regard  to  the  physical 
environment and the relicts of the mining industry, the conversion policy has had 
a major impact. On the one hand new industrial landscapes (for example for the 
DSM enterprise) were laid out, and new infrastructure was constructed in the form 
of regional roads, and highways (Kasper et al., 2013; Toonen, 1972). On the other 
hand, the industrial landscapes that became obsolete after the closing of the mines 
were restructured and reallocated. This restructuring policy, often referred to as 
‘van zwart naar groen’ (black to green)- referring to the transition from dusty black 
mining relicts, to a green park-like setting, post-industrial landscape - resulted in 
the  destruction  of  many  landmarks  referring  to  the  mining  past.  In  fact,  this 
happened with striking speed, and nearly all references to the extraction of coal 
were  removed  from  the  landscape.  As  an  example,  the  last  coal  mine,  i.e.  the 
Oranje-Nassau I, ceased production in 1974 and already in 1978 there was not a 
single  place  left  where  one  could  come  across  a  coherent  whole  of  slag  heaps,

mine structures and miners’ cottages (van Veldhoven, 2015). Dutch reconversion 
policy  and  practice  thus  aimed  at  removing  the  obsolete  mining  landscape  and 
transforming  it  into  a  post-mining  landscape.  The  strong  focus  on  physical 
reconversion  however  meant  that  other  aspect  did  not  get  full  attention,  in 
particular social aspects and the recognition of industrial heritage. 
With regard to the social aspects, it should be noted that miners who lost their 
jobs also lost status in society. Their self-esteem deteriorated, and social isolation 
occurred—the  mines  were  no  longer  guiding  the  social  infrastructure  of  society 
(Kasper,  2012). Together  with  the  upcoming  secularization,  the  closing  of  the 
mines caused insecurity among the miners and unrest in families (Kasper, 2012). 
Moreover,  the  large-scale  demolishment  of  mining  relicts  did  also  lead  to  the 
situation that former miners felt deceived; they saw and felt their world collapse 
around them (GM13: former miner, 2019; van Veldhoven, 2015). This frustration 
can  still  be  noted  at  present  day:  “The  Dutch  government  is  not  interested  in 
Limburg’s most southern region and this region itself is characterized by the perils 
of  village  politics,  this  doesn’t  help  for  taking  care  of  heritage. This  also  differs 
from Belgium where they treat the past with respects and accordingly look after 
their  heritage” (GM13:  former  miner,  2019). With  regard  to  the  heritage 
management policy were this interviewee refers to, it should however be noted 
that  at  the  time  of  the  closing  of  the  mines,  the  public  opinion  about  mining 
heritage  was  rather  negative.  Many  of  the  former miners suffered  from  severe 
forms of silicosis, felt deceived, and their status had evaporated. At that time, due 
to  the  social  trauma  of  the  closures  of  the  mines,  there  seemed  to  be  first  and 
foremost a ‘need to forget’ as van Veldhoven (2015) calls it. This is underlined by 
a guide from the Dutch mining museum:  
“One wanted to demolish all objects that reminded of the mining period, this 
was called ‘van zwart naar groen’, only later on, one started to reject this 
since everything was gone” (GM15: guide museum, 2019).  
Only from the 1990s onwards, public opinion changed as people once again started 
to show interest in the mining past and related heritage. At that time, also heritage 
organizations started to recognize industrial heritage (van Veldhoven, 2015).  
In Belgium, the mining industry had been the central, and until after the 1945, the 
only industrial sector of any significance in the Flemish Province of Limburg. Since 
this  mining  industry  was  dominated  by  Walloon  capital - both  in  terms  of 
investment capital flows and destination of coal production – there was almost no 
regional  capitalist-entrepreneurial  tradition  in  this  region (Swyngedouw, 1996). 
Already during the 1950’s the mining industry showed signs of stagnation and new 
industry – notably Ford and Philips- were attracted to generate new employment 
opportunities.  Yet,  by  the  time  the  closure  was  announced,  17000  miners were 
still  employed  in  the  sector,  while  the  region  was  suffering  from  higher  than 
average  unemployment (Hassink  et  al.,  1995).  Therefore,  together  with  the 
closure, the national state decided to initiate the most gigantic project of urban 
and  regional  development  ever  undertaken  in  Belgium (van  den  Panhuyzen, 
1989).  The  state  embarked  100b  Belgian  Francs  (about  2.5b  euros)  for  both 
redundancy  payments  and  to  support  and  co-finance  investment  in  the  socio-
economic and spatial reconversion and restructuring of the region (Swyngedouw, 
1996). The reconversion plans were outlined in a document called ‘Future contract

for Limburg’ (Toekomstcontract voor Limburg) aiming at the production of a new 
region, based on erasing the old physical landscape, the socio-cultural fabric and 
the  mental  image  of  the  region  and  the  construction  of  a  new  urban  landscape 
(Swyngedouw, 1996; Vlaamse Overheid, 1987).  
Next to the focus on creating a new labour profile, there was thus also a strong 
tendency to get rid of the mining landscape. This strong focus on creating a new 
urban landscape is underlined by one of the interviewees: “In this region however, 
everything  had  to  disappear,  because  one  thought that  these  buildings  were 
negative reminders of a negative past” (GM21: tour guide, 2019). The large-scale 
demolition works however also lead to protests from heritage organizations and 
from local citizens, herewith illustrating the love-hate relationship with the mining 
past. An example of the city of Eisden: 
“Here in Eisden, there were 56 buildings from the mining period on one site. 
Almost nothing is left now. We made plans for the protection of this former 
mining  site,  we  even  protested,  but  without  much  success.  Even  former 
miners came to us, asking us what we were doing. They told us to get rid of 
all  the buildings because  it reminded  them  of  a  very  negative,  unhealthy 
past. But as soon as they started to demolish things, the same persons came 
to us, worried about the scale of the demolition works. This shows the love-
hate  relationship;  the  mining  past  is  not  a  romantic  story” (GM21:  tour 
guide, 2019) 
Amongst  other  reasons  (such  as  financial  scandals)  these  protest  led  to  the 
establishment  of  a  new  conversion  agency  for  the  Flemish  Province  of  Limburg. 
This, so called LRM (Limburgse Reconversiemaatschapij) then became responsible 
for the remaining buildings and relicts from the mining period. Also citizens started 
to organize themselves as they established local associations for the protection of 
the mining buildings and relicts. It was at this time that people started to see the 
value  of  these  buildings  and  even  started  to  see  it  as  potential  heritage  objects 
(Delarbre  et  al.,  2009;  van  Veldhoven,  2015).  Focus  then  shifted  towards 
protection  of  the  still  remaining  mining  buildings.  Redevelopment  and  re-use  of 
these buildings by giving them a new function (e.g. for tourism or living) has been 
done more and more over the past decades. Although these redevelopment are 
(financially) supported by the conversion agency LRM, it are still very expensive, 
complicated processes (Delarbre et al., 2009). Mainly because there is a lack of 
support and of financial means:  
“Dealing  with  mining  heritage is  not  easy,  no  one  is  supporting  you  and 
there  are  no  funds,  this  is  not  like  taking  care  of  castles.  You  never  get 
support for this” (GM21: tour guide, 2019). 
In short, the story of the physical conversion of the mining landscape in Belgium 
is  a  dynamic one.  At  first  a  policy  focusing  on  demolishment  was  initiated,  but 
citizens and politicians then started to embrace their once denied mining past as 
they started to protect and redevelop former mining buildings.

Germany 
Conversion  of  the  mining  landscapes  in  Germany  took  place  more  gradually, 
meaning that time was taken in order to think about a post-mining economy and 
landscape (Soete  et  al.,  2000).  Conversion  in  the  former  mining  district  in  the 
region  Aachen,  aimed  at  creating  industries  related  to  technological  expertise. 
Indeed,  Aachen  is  building  its  conversion  on  the  presence  of  one  of  the  largest 
European technical universities which already led to the establishment of hundreds 
of  small  engineering  and  consultancy  firms (Hassink  et  al.,  1995).  Besides,  a 
strong focus was put on the establishment of research- and consultancy firm in 
the domain of energy and sustainability. In the German city of Jüllich for example, 
a technology park was founded with the support of the German government which 
funded this technology park for about 90% (Soete et al., 2000). 
Next to the economic conversion, the physical conversion of the mining landscape 
was  quite  impactful  in  Germany.  In  fact, alike  the  Netherlands,  in  the  former 
mining district in the region Aachenhardly any of the industrial buildings such as 
offices,  cooling  towers,  coal  bunkers,  washing  plants  and  so  forth  have  been 
preserved (van  Veldhoven,  2015).  The  city  landscape  of  the  town  of  Alsdorf 
(Germany) still shows the reminders of this conversion policy. For over decades, 
the cityscape of Alsdorf has been dominated by the mines which were located in 
the hearth of the town. Hence, the town depended on its mining industry. In 1992 
however, it was announced that mines had to close in Alsdorf as well. At that time, 
a  large  conversion  plan  was  set  up  which  focused  on  the  demolishment  of  the 
mining buildings. Accordingly, the large mining complex in the town’s middle has 
been demolished and for the largest part transferred into an urban green park in 
the period 1992-1995 (GM14: guide museum, 2019; Heinrichs et al., 2008). Some 
buildings remained and serve as a landmark nowadays (e.g. the water tower, and 
the shaft tower), whereas some other buildings are re-used as new functions are 
added  (e.g.  a  high  school  and  a  museum).  Most  parts  have  however  been 
demolished  leaving  a  wide  open  area.  Some  parts  of  this  area  then  were 
transformed  into  for  example  a  residential  area  or  a  shopping  centre,  but  the 
largest part was transformed into an urban green park (Heinrichs  et al.,  2008). 
Also in Alsdorf, a link was made with the post-mining story related to technological 
expertise and energy. The museum focuses for example on ‘experiencing energy’, 
and throughout the park a so called ‘Weg der Energie’ can be followed, which leads 
you along various stops which inform you about energy and technology (GM14: 
guide museum, 2019). 
In  all  three  countries the  removal  of  these  industrial activities  left  marks  in  the 
three countries’ history. Besides, for a long time, the heritage of the mining era 
was not recognized. In The Netherlands, most explicit mining relicts (such as the 
shafts)  were  demolished  and  are  not  visible  anymore  in  today’s  landscape.  In 
Germany, closed mining areas were partly demolished and partly kept as natural 
and historical monuments. In Belgium, the policies aimed at erasing most relicts 
of the mining past were only partly implemented, and many relicts remained intact 
though  severely  deteriorated. Thus,  all  three  mining  regions  have  followed  a 
different  conversion  process. But  despite  these  differences,  many scars  of  the 
industrial past still characterize todays’ cultural landscape of the region.

2 The Grünmetropole-project 
The area of the Grünmetropole is thus characterized by a common denominator of 
the industrial past and the mining activities shaped the physical landscape in the 
region. Mining industry in this region however has a dynamic history of industrial 
production, decline, and reconversion. Indeed, the removal and reconversion of 
these industrial sites left marks in the three countries’ history and moreover the 
scars of the industrial in many cases still characterize the present-day landscape. 
Only more recently mining heritage started to be recognized (as explained above). 
Public opinion changed as people once again started to show interest in the mining 
past and related heritage. One interviewee states:  
“First people used to see the mining past as a negative history, but at the 
same time it is just part of our collective memory” (GM21: tour guide, 2019).  
This is further explained by a Dutch municipal policy officer who explains:  
“There is now a generation who is not familiar with the region’s mining past, 
but  who  is  nevertheless  looking  for  their  roots  in  order  to  understand 
developments in their living environment” (GM3: policy officer, 2019).  
Also  (local)  heritage  organization  started  to  recognize  industrial  heritage,  listed 
them  as  classified  buildings,  or  made  plans  for  redevelopment  of  these  former 
mining buildings. These redevelopments were linked to other domains like tourism, 
leisure, living, nature development, or shopping (GM19: policy officer, 2019). 
It is against this backdrop that the Grünmetropole project was conceived. Aiming 
at  rehabilitating  mining  heritage  by  connecting  local projects and  mining  relicts 
with  touristic  routes. The  Grünmetropole as a  project followed  from  a  German 
regional initiative called “EuRegionale 2008”. The Grünmetropole was a flagship 
design project within the EuRegionale 2008s’ track “Conversion of former industrial 
landscapes”.

2.1 Die EuRegionale 2008 – Grenzen Überschreiten 
In order to explain the origin of the project the Grünmetropole, the concept of the 
‘Regionale’ and  more  specifically  the  2008  EuRegionale  project  needs  to  be 
explained first. The Regionale is a design instrument used by the German federal 
state  North-Rhine-Westphalia. North-Rhine-Westphalia is  a  state  in western 
Germany  covering  an  area  of 34,084  square  kilometres.  This  state – the  most 
densely populated state of Germany – is divided into 31 districts (Kreise) and 23 
urban districts (kreisfreie Städte). The Regionale is a tool for regional development 
initiated by the state. The Regionale can be seen as a design instrument that aims 
at co-operation between various stakeholders, such as districts and municipalities 
(Dembski, 2006), hereby focusing on one or several (urban) district. Although the 
Regionale is (financially) supported by the state government, it is up to the region 
(i.e. district(s)) and the regional governments to co-operate in order to implement 
the  Regionale (Dembski,  2006). Moreover,  the  design  instrument is  used  to 
strengthen the identity of a certain region (i.e. one or several (urban) district) and 
to promote the region to the outside world (Dembski, 2006; Kuss et al., 2010). 
The outcome of the Regionale was the development of various projects focusing 
on topics such as landscape, heritage, tourism, and culture. The first Regionale 
was organized in 2000 and from then on organized bi-annually.

region’s  industrial  past  as  a  driver  for  future  development, mainly by  linking 
industrial heritage to tourism. It is within this EuRegionale-track that the project 
Grünmetropole was developed and implemented.  
The design process of the EuRegionale projects took from 2002 to 2005, already 
during this design process a strong focus was put on historical links in the cross-
border region. In 2002 for example, a Aachen-based’ foundation called Kathy Beys 
for instance already proposed to link elements of the industrial past in order to use 
them  as  a  resource  for  the  future (Vos  &  Gottschalk,  2009).  The Kathy  Beys 
foundation   has   supported   the   EuRegionale   and   the   development   of   the 
Grünmetropole  throughout  the  years  that  followed  (till  2008).  Within  the  track 
conversion of former industrial landscapes, a call for projects, called Industrielle 
Folgelandschaft, was launched in January 2004. The design teams taking part in 
this competition were encouraged to take  into  account  various  aspect  related  to 
cross-border  cooperation  in  order  to  enhance  the  profile  of  the  German-Dutch-
Belgian border region. Eight international teams of architects and designers took 
part in the design competition.  
An international team under the direction of the French landscape architect Henri 
Bava  (in  corporation  with  other  designers:  Alex  Wall,  Stephen  Craig  and  Erik 
Behrens) also  took  part  in  this  design  competition  and  proposed a  design 
masterplan title “Grünmetropole” (Heinrichs et al., 2008). At the end of 2004, the 
design  plans  were  reviewed  by  the  EuRegionale  agency  and the  concept  of a 
“Grünmetropole”  was  selected  as  winner  of  this  design  competition.  This  was 
followed  by  the  presentation  of  the  design  masterplan  in  spring  2005 (Vos  & 
Gottschalk, 2009).  
In this same period of time (2005-2008), supporting organizations and finance had 
to be found in order to implement the Grünmetropole design. With regard to the 
latter, half of the needed resources (3.8 million euros) came from the participating 
stakeholders

, such as municipalities, and from the EuRegionale 2008 agency itself 
which in  turn  was  funded  by  the German  federal  state  North-Rhine-Westphalia. 
Besides,  funding  came  available by  linking  the  Grünmetropole  project  to  an 
existing  INTERREG-program. This  INTERREG-program,  called  ‘INTERREG  III  A 
program  for  the  Euregion Meuse-Rhine  region’,  focused  on the  development  of 
cross-border  cooperation  between  Belgium,  Germany  and  the  Netherlands. 
Application for this INTERREG-program, which run in the period 2000-2006, was 
done by the ‘Stichting Euregio Maas-Rijn’, a foundation based in Maastricht. Within 
this  INTERREG-program,  the  European  Commission  co-financed  projects  with  a 
structural funds assistance of a total budget of 211 million euros
2
. One subproject 
within this INTERREG-program was called Industrielle Folgelandschaft (conversion 
of   former   industrial   landscapes).   It   is   within   this   subproject   that   the 
Grünmetropole-project,  as  well  as  one  other  project  called Pays  des  Terrils (a 
project  in  the  former  mining  region  in  the  Belgian  Walloon  region,  focusing  on 
ecological research, and conversion of the coal mines’ spoil heaps by transforming

 A participating small municipality, like the municipality of As, for example had to contribute about 12.000 euros 
for  placing  of  signs  and one information  panel  at  the  train station  in  the  city  of  As (Het  Nieuwsblad/Limburg, 
2008).

was  made  available  for  the  Grünmetropole-project (Eibler  et  al.,  2014;  Vos  & 
Gottschalk, 2009). 
2.3 The project Grünmetropole 
The concept of the Grünmetropole thus was the centerpiece of the track conversion 
of former industrial landscapes. Indeed the Grünmetropole concept fitted well into 
the overall concept of the EuRegionale 2008 to unify the region and create a new 
identity.   This   becomes   apparent as   we   review and   analyze the   2005’ 
Grünmetropole masterplan (Bava et al., 2005). The Grünmetropole was intended 
to  reframe  the  area  as  a  sub-region  with  the  Western-European  network  of 
metropolis (like Berlin and Paris). This sub-region would then be characterized by 
a combination of urban centers and nature and culture as connecting elements in-
between urban areas. It was argued that such a framing as sub-region functioning 
as  one  entity  would  give  the  region a  strong  economic  impulse,  and  would 
encourage closer cooperation among  stakeholders (Bava  et  al.,  2005). To 
underline the connectivity within the area of the Grünmetropole, the Master Plan 
identified three main goals (Bava et al., 2005): 
• renewal of the landscape in order to give the region a socio-economic 
impulse; 
• strengthen the common storyline and identity of the former mining area; 
• creation of impulses for a touristic future by creating new touristic routes. 
Although  named  differently,  these  goals  are  also  mentioned  by  a  Dutch  policy 
officer:  
“The three main objectives of the Grünmetropole were: connecting people 
and places, to enhance a regional identity, and to stimulate tourism” (GM2: 
policy officer, 2019).  
He clarifies that this latter point was especially important. Moreover, the overall 
goals of the EuRegionale (cross-border cooperation), and of the track (conversion 
of former mining areas) were taken into account (Heinrichs et al., 2008). This is 
also underlined by one of the interviewees: 
“The  initial  aim  of  this  project  was  to  present  the  mining  history  of  the 
region,  and  to  stimulate  cross-border  cooperation” (GM1:  tourist  officer, 
2019). 
In  order  to  reach  these  goals, two  cross-border  tourist  routes through  the 
landscape, and along the relicts of the mining past in the landscape were designed. 
These routes were designed to link the post-industrial landscapes in the German, 
Dutch  and  Belgian  border  region,  and  to encourage  residents  and tourists  to 
explore the region (Bava et al., 2005). The two routes are: the ‘Green Route’ for 
cyclists  and  the  ‘Metropolisroute’  for  motorists (see  map Picture 6). The  Green 
Route  takes  cyclist  through  some  of  the  natural  areas  of  the  region.  The 
Metropolisroute focuses on the industrial heritage of the more urban areas. This 
route is set up for discovering the region by car. Both routes have a length of about 
250  kilometres,  and  connect  about  70  touristic  highlights related  to  the  mining

past, but also local culture and nature (Bava et al., 2005; Heinrichs et al., 2008; 
van der Heyden, 2008). 
 
 
 
Both routes were designed as part of a umbrella structure called ‘Urban DNA’ which 
was designed to form a green equivalent of metropolis in Europe. A clear defined 
and  promoted  ‘Urban  DNA’,  it  was  argued,  would  also  help  to  strengthen  the 
identity of the region (Bava et al., 2005; Heinrichs et al., 2008) making the region 
‘more readable’. The Master Plan defined six main elements of this ‘Urban DNA’: 
1) the  cities, 2) natural  and  rural  areas, 3) the  former  spoils  heaps  of  the  coal 
mines, 4) the neighborhoods were the miners used to live, 5) the former mining 
shafts and other industrial buildings, and 6) other landscape features which are 
linked  to  the mining past (Bava  et  al.,  2005).  For  all  these  six  elements  of  the 
‘Urban  DNA’  specific  development  goals  were  identified  in  line  with  the  overall 
objectives of the Grünmetropole plan. 
Part of the design was to connect about 70 touristic highlights related to the mining 
past, but also local culture and nature, to the two designed routes (for an overview 
of all projects which were connected to the routes see Error! Reference source

conversion  of  former  industrial  landscapes  such  as  the aforementioned  project 
Wormdal, which is about nature and tourism. Besides, also former mining sites, 
cities, nature areas, former miner’s neighbourhoods and so on and so forth were 
mentioned as a stop on the routes. Selection of these stops was initially done by 
the designers (see the masterplan: Bava et al., 2005), but these stops have been 
adjusted  during  the  implementation  phase of  the  Grünmetropole  (2005-2008). 
One interviewee explains:  
“Initially,  the  points  of  interest  were  chosen  in  such  a  way  that  they 
represented the mining history. Later on they added also different locations, 
but initially it was focused on the mining history. However, because some 
entrepreneurs  along  the  route  complained  that  only  some  locations  were 
selected, they changed their mind, and some other locations were added” 
(GM1: tourist officer, 2019).  
In  order  to  implement  the  Grünmetropole,  chosen  as  the  winner  of  the  design 
competition in 2005, an organizational structure was set up. A working group led 
by  the  EuRegionale  2008  Agency,  and  in  the  case  of  the  Grünmetropole  more 
precisely Kreis Aachen, Parkstad Limburg/NL en Toerisme Limburg/B, held regular 
meeting with the 25 organizations involved in the Grünmetropole project (among 
other  district  governments,  municipalities,  and  tourist  organizations)  to  ensure 
concrete implementation. This working group for instance assisted in the search 
for locations for information panels and routing signage, application for permits, 
distribution  of  information  leaflets  etc. (Eibler  et  al.,  2014;  Vos  &  Gottschalk, 
2009). It is also noted in the Master Plan that all interested stakeholders in the 
region could have their say in order to make the Grünmetropole effective in terms 
of cooperation and development in the region (Bava et al., 2005). The roles of the 
various  stakeholders  however  varied,  ranging  from  designing  and  implementing 
the routes, to an advisory role to reflect on the designed routes. One interviewee 
who works at a Dutch touristic organization explains:  
“Selecting stops along a route was done in cooperation with municipalities 
and other organizations. They asked us to think about potential locations, 
so called ‘points of interest’, but not for designing the routes. Besides, we 
could made proposals, like did you consider this, or this, or this? I think we 
just had an advisory role as organization at that time” (GM1: tourist officer, 
2019).  
Also local (heritage) organizations had a supporting role in the design process:  
“Local  non-professional  history  clubs  were  asked  to  get  involved  in  the 
Grünmetropole  project.  Those  who  did  participate  could  then  propose 
historic objects, landscapes, or sites that could be interesting to make them 
part of the Grünmetropole’ touristic routes” (GM2: policy officer, 2019).  
This  person  however  notes  that  these  local history  clubs only  had  a  supporting 
role,  they  had  no  decisive  say  in  the  design  phase  of  the  project (GM2:  policy 
officer, 2019). In short, although the local (heritage) organizations, entrepreneurs, 
and  communities  had  only  an  advisory  role,  they  were  able  to  influence  the

selection   of   points   of   interest,   and   there   with   the   route   design   of   the 
Grünmetropole (GM1: tourist officer, 2019; GM2: policy officer, 2019).  
The resulting 70 touristic highlights were thus both selected by the designers of 
the  Grünmetropole (see  the  masterplan:  Bava  et  al.,  2005),  as  well  as  by 
entrepreneurs,  local  (heritage)  groups  and  citizens  who  were  consulted  on 
potential  stops  as  well. Hence,  there  were  some  small  differences  between  the 
initial design and the implemented project. The list of about 70 touristic stops along 
the  Grünmetropole  route  is  thus  very  divers,  including  sites  related  to  former 
mining  activities,  nature  areas,  cities,  but  also  shopping  malls  and  even 
recreational sites like a theme park. 29 sites are located in the Netherlands, 23 
sites in Germany and 20 sites in Belgium. We found 16 sites that are nature areas 
located on former industrial (and thus converted) landscapes, and 7 other nature 
areas  that did  not link  to  the  mining  history.  We  found  16  museums along  the 
route,  of  which  only  3  were  directly  related  to  the  mining  history. We  found  7 
heritage  sites  that  did  not  link  at  all  to  the  mining  history,  but  were  either  a 
watermill, castle or abbey. We found 10 recreational sites with a commercial use 
(event  center,  wellness,  sports  facilities  etc.),  some  of  them  located  on  former 
mining sites (such as a slope of a former spoil heap hosting a ski centre). We found 
3 information points, of which 2 were linked to mining. We found 6 sites that were 
restaurant/pub/hotel,  often  located  at  a  (non-mining  related)  heritage  site.  We 
found 4 social/cultural centers, and 3 city/shopping centers are listed. Of all these 
sites, we could only link 27 directly or indirectly to the mining history of the region  
(see for a full overview Appendix 3).  
The  link  between  these  stops,  the  two  routes,  and  the  overall  Grünmetropole 
project  is  thus  often  equivocal.  Some  projects,  like  the  aforementioned  project 
‘Wormdal’  were  part  of  the  EuRegionale  2008  and  for  that  reason  linked  to  the 
Grünmetropole  project  by  making  it  a  stop  on  the  routes.  The  development  of 
these projects was directly linked to the Grünmetropole plan (Vos & Gottschalk, 
2009).  Other  stops  on  the  route  were  selected  since  local  entrepreneurs  for 
example proposed their location (e.g. a pub or recreational area) to become part 
of the Grünmetropole route. These stops were then listed as a stop and got a sign 
to put on their façade to indicate that this was a stop on the Grünmetropole route. 
Besides that, these stops (or projects/buildings) had no organizational, financial 
or thematic link with the Grünmetropole. This also accounts to some of the stops 
on former mining sites, who perhaps relate to the overall thematic focus of the 
Grünmetropole, but had no organizational or financial link to the project. Moreover, 
the  conversion  and  redevelopment  of  many  projects  and  places  along  the 
Grünmetropole  route  took  place  fully  independently  from  the  Grünmetropole 
project.  The supervision  by the  EuRegionala  2008  Agency only  related  to  the 
implementation  of  the  route  signage  and  information  panels,  and  all, 25 
cooperation   organizations   were each   individually responsible   for   the   final 
implementation(Bava et al., 2005).

The Grünmetropole project was implemented in spring 2008 by the placement of 
the   route signage,   information   panels,   and   traffic   signs   (for   a complete 
chronological  overview  see Picture ). The  “Metropolisroute’  was  opened  in  May 
2008; the ‘Green route’ in June 2008 (Vos & Gottschalk, 2009)(see map Picture 6 
and  map Error!  Reference  source  not  found.). The  routes  only  use  existing 
roads, since this made it easier to design the route and it was more about creating 
a connection rather than designing roads (GM1: tourist officer, 2019; GM19: policy 
officer,  2019). Supporting  information  about  the  routes including  maps  were 
disturbed through existing touristic infrastructure like tourist offices in the region. 
Information leaflets and route maps were made available in different languages.

After implementation yet another organizational model and funding scheme were 
set-up in order to keep information about the Grünmetropole routes available, and 
to  further  strengthen  and  promote  the  touristic  services  within  the  tri-national 
cross-border region, especially with regard to regional culture, industrial heritage 
and nature. The new organization, called ‘Grünmetropole e.V.’ was founded in June 
2009 (Vos  &  Gottschalk,  2009).  This  organization  aimed  at  maintenance  and 
further  development  of  the  touristic  routes  in  the  region  Aachen,  including  the 
Grünmetropole routes. 14 German organizations are part of ‘Grünmetropole e.V.’, 
mainly governments of cities in the region Aachen, as well as governments of the 
districts
3
.  Funding  for  these  activities  was  available  because  of  yet  another 
INTERREG-programme. This INTERREG-programme, called INTERREG IV A-Project 
TIGER  (Touristic  Valorisation  of  the  cross-border  European  Region),  aimed  at 
enhancing the touristic profile of the German-Dutch-Belgian border region (Eibler 
et al., 2014). From 2008 till 2013 funding was available through this INTERREG-
programme.  For  this  INTERREG-programme,  the  organization  ‘Grünmetropole 
e.V.’  cooperated  with  several  other  organizations  namely:  tourist  office  Zuid-
Limburg  (Netherlands), Toerisme  Limburg (Belgium),  Parkstad  Limburg  (i.e.  a 
regional  cooperative  between  8  Dutch  municipalities),  and  the Féderation  du 
Tourisme  de  la  Province  de  Liège (i.e.  Belgian  tourist  office).  Although  these 
organizations were thus also involved in maintaining the Grünmetropole routes, it 
were mainly the German organizations (e.g. ‘Grünmetropole e.V.’) which put most 
effort in keeping the Grünmetropole routes up to date. One interviewee who works 
at the tourist office Zuid-Limburg, explains:

“In Germany a better marketing strategy resulted in the situation that the 
Grünmetropole is still up to date there. In the Netherlands, we decided to 
only maintain the routes without further marketing. Belgium is comparable 
to the Netherlands, they do maintain the route, although they do not really 
know what this route is about” (GM1: tourist officer, 2019).  
It appears that the ‘Grünmetropole e.V.’ is not well known:  
“It  would  be  good  if  there  would  be  an  organization  responsible  for  the 
Grünmetropole nowadays, but I have no idea who that could be” (GM16: 
heritage officer, 2019).  
A policy officer working at a Dutch municipality adds to this that maintenance of 
the Grünmetropole routes was dependent on funding:  
“When funding stops, the project also stops, since no one is responsible any 
longer” (GM3: policy officer, 2019)  
and  
“Maintenance is an issue. There is funding for just three of four years, and 
afterwards no money is available anymore” (GM1: tourist officer, 2019).  
Another person highlights the importance of political support:  
“They made nice maps, and information leaflets, but there was no political 
support, thus not the projects’ soul is absent” (GM13: former miner, 2019).  
Thus, although a special organization was set up in order to maintain the route, a 
lack of responsibility, funding, and political support resulted in degradation of the 
Grünmetropole routes. At present day both touristic routes are badly maintained 
and  consequently  barely  used (GM1:  tourist  officer,  2019;  GM11:  tour  guide, 
2019; GM19: policy officer, 2019; GM21: tour guide, 2019).  
“You can see that it is just barely used by cyclists, they choose either the 
existing  cycling  network  (Knoopuntenroute), or  a  route  that  is  better 
marketed. This route is marketed 10 years ago, so people just don’t know 
about  it:  they  see  the  signs  but  wonder  what  it  is  about” (GM1: tourist 
officer, 2019).  
Another person adds to this:  
“I was surprised when I read that you are interested in the Grünmetropole, I 
didn’t expect  that  anyone  would  still  be  interested  in  the  Grünmetropole” 
(GM21: tour guide, 2019).

2.4 Example: Beringen 
Part  of  the  Grünmetropole  design  was  the  idea  to  connect about  70  touristic 
highlights related to the mining past to the two designed routes. These highlights 
were designed as a stop along the route, were tourists could stop to visit a site 
and  to  get  more information.  Selection  of these  stops  was initially  done  by  the 
designers (see  the  masterplan:  Bava  et  al.,  2005),  but  these  stops  have  been 
adjusted   during   the   implementation   phase   of   the  Grünmetropole   as   also 
entrepreneurs, local (heritage) groups and citizens shared their ideas for potential 
stops along the route. This resulted in a varied collection of touristic highlights. 
The  list  of  about  70  touristic  stops  along  the  Grünmetropole  route  is  thus  very 
divers, these stops include sites related to former mining activities, nature areas, 
cities, but also shopping malls and even recreational sites like a theme park. The 
link between these stops, the two routes, and the overall Grünmetropole project 
is however equivocal. Many projects and places, including former mining sites, had 
no organizational or financial link with the Grünmetropole project besides that they 
were listed as a stop. The developments and heritage re-use processes on those 
projects and places thus took place independently from the Grünmetropole project. 
To explain especially this later group of stops, a closer look into the example of 
the city of Beringen (Belgium) is useful.

As a city, Beringen is inextricably linked to its mining past. In Beringen the mining 
past is still very present as the relicts of the former mining settlement have been 
preserved comprehensively. This means that next to the mining site itself (with 
the shafts, sewage plants, offices and so on) also the coal heap can be found, the 
former  residential  areas  (i.e.  a  garden  city),  the  former  recreational  buildings, 
churches,  and  other  community  buildings,  and  the  properties  of  the  different 
migrant  worker  communities  such  as  a  mosque,  a  clubhouse  of  the  Polish 
community,  and  a  Greek  orthodox  church,  can  still  be  seen  in  present  day 
landscape (GM11: tour guide, 2019). Various of these sites are included as stop 
on the Grünmetropole route, this includes: the coal heap, the Flemish museum of 
mining  which  is  housed  in  a  former  mining  office  building,  and  the  former 
residential areas (i.e. a garden city) (van der Heyden, 2008). Since many of the 
mining  relicts  have  been  preserved,  Beringen  almost  feels  like  an  ‘open-air 
museum’ (Heinrichs et al., 2008). Indeed in Beringen, different from other Belgian 
cities, Beringen chose to focus on experiencing the mining past:  
“At  the  time  of  the  closing  of  the  mines,  people  were  stuck  with  these 
buildings, they were wondering what to do with them, in some cases, such 
as  ‘Zwartberg’  (city  of  Genk,  Belgium),  they  demolisshed  everything.  In 
some other cases they did ‘beatiful things’ with these buildings, for example 
in Eisden, where they opened a shopping mall on the former mining grounds. 
In  other  cases,  they  made  different  choises  with  regard  to  the  re-use  of 
these buildings, such as here in Beringen where we focus on ‘mijnbeleving’ 
(i.e. the mining experience)” (GM11: tour guide, 2019).  
This  descision  to  protect  the  minin  site  of  Beringen  was  made  by  the  national 
government:  
“It was a conscious decision by the Flemish government to protect at least 
one former mining site, as complete as possible. The decision was made in 
favor for Beringen, that is why you can read the story so clear here. Only a 
few years after the closure of the mines, the minister decided to protect as 
much as possible here in Beringen, this was in the year 1994” (GM20: policy 
officer, 2019).  
Although  many  mining  relicts  have  been  preserved,  and  Beringen  feels  like  a 
museum, many developments took place, especially with regard to the mining site 
itself.  
The mining site has been, and still is, being redeveloped, hereby partly re-using 
former mining buildings. The coal heap has for example been transformed into a, 
so called ‘adventure park’, which means that there is a playground, mountain bike 
trail, hiking trail, and viewing platform developed. The sewage treatment plant is 
for  instance  transformed  in  an  aquarium  with  diving  activities  taking  place (see 
Picture 6). One of the former offices has been transformed into the Flemish mining 
museum, and the former power plant has been transformed into an indoor climbing 
centre. Some other buildings, like the shaft towers, has been renovated and are 
preserved as a listed monument. Next, there are some new buildings added to the 
site, a couple of houses, a swimming pool, and a shopping mall are built on the 
site. Finally, there are also some buildings which have neither been renovated, nor 
been developed into a new function. Hence it is still unclear what will happen to 

 
H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Observatory Case report: The Grünmetropole   
25 
 
the coal washery complex on the site (GM10: heritage officer, 2019). Alike, there 
are plans for new developments, like building a mining experience centre, and a 
hotel (GM17: tourist officer, 2019; GM18: tourist officer, 2019).  
The developments on the former mining site in Beringen are clustered under the 
name ‘Be-Mine’. This developments on Be-Mine were however a  
“difficult,  complicated,  and  long  lasting  process” (GM20:  policy  officer, 
2019)  
since  the  start.  “When  we  started,  there  was  even  a  kind  of  aversion  against 
protection; one did not understand why the minister decided to protect so much 
here in Beringen. So people ignored it, and just weren’t interested. This sentiment 
was there from the start, people thought, it is rather useless to protect all this, 
whose gone pay for this. So the lack of vision, the lack of interest, has always been 
there” (GM20:  policy  officer,  2019).  First  it  was  only  the  government who was 
responsible  for  the  developments  in  Beringen.  However,  some  other  projects 
initiated by the government failed and consequently the government was hesitant 
to join. For a short period of time, the government relied on a private investor, but 
this also appeared to be unsuccessful.  
“Then this lead to some new insights for the government; they couldn’t just 
not care, but had to take a central role and had to take the responsibility. 
For a small scale municipality like Beringen, however, we didn’t have the 
power,  money,  or  ideas  to  develop  this  site  or  lead  the  redevelopment 
process. At a certain moment, the province, the municipality and the Flemish 
government  came  together  and  took  their  responsibilities  to  develop  this 
site. A cooperation agreement was signed in 2009 and the Beringen project 
was  recognized  as  a  Flemish  key  development  project.  Then  consistently 
more  and more  funding  was  available.  Yet,  the  government  realized  that 
they  needed  private  and  commercial  investors,  so  they  had  to  allow 
functions like living, leisure and tourism. So they opted for a public-private-
partnership,  so  that  governmental  funding’s  were  doubled  by  private 
partners within this public-private-partnership. Then we had to find a private 
investor,  to  set  up  the  ‘Be-Mine-agency’.  A  consortium  with  the  LRM 
(Investment company Limburg) and 2 private developers was founded and 
they developed a masterplan, and started to develop. The easiest parts were 
developed  as  first,  than  some  opportunistic  developments  took  place” 
(GM20: policy officer, 2019).  
Developments  focused  on  various  function  as  commercial  developments  were 
allowed on this site.  
“When the minister started to protect this site in 1994, we decided to not 
transform this site into a museum, but we chose for a more mixed, urban, 
development including a museum. Yet, this was not the main function, it 
had  to  be  more  than just  leisure  and  tourism.  Therefore  we  decided  to 
include also commercial functions, like shops, and room for living” (GM20: 
policy officer, 2019).  
However, this led to additional difficulties. The idea was that developing houses 
and commercial buildings would generate financial resources which in turn could 

 
H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Observatory Case report: The Grünmetropole   
26 
 
be invested in heritage re-use projects. This economic model however failed, since 
the houses appeared to be difficult to sell. So  
“all  in  all  it  was  a  very  difficult  process,  because  people  ignored  it, 
governments  who  did  first  not  cooperate,  and  because  we  were  always 
searching for funds for a huge project like this” (GM20: policy officer, 2019).  
Moreover, it was a difficult process since an overall vision for the site lacked and 
the developer converted the site in a rather opportunistic way and developments 
depended on coincidence (GM19: policy officer, 2019):  
“The development of the diving center is a good heritage re-use example. 
But  this  was  by  chance,  two  entrepreneurs  came  to the  development 
company and told them that they wanted to develop such a diving center, 
they were looking for a location. Here was the perfect location for that. So 
this  is  very  dependent  on  coincidence  and  some  local  entrepreneurs  who 
want to develop something. The same goes for the climbing center, which 
was  initiated  by  an  enthusiastic  hobby  climber  who  looked  for  a  suitable 
location, which appeared to be the former electricity factory. These are nice 
developments,  which  came  here  coincidently,  but  however  fit  well  to  the 
overall story” (GM20: policy officer, 2019).  
That’s according to two policy officers of the municipality of Beringen also the main 
strength  of  the  development  process:  that  they  didn’t  choose  to  focus  on  one 
function,  but  that  various  functions  were  allowed  that fitted  next  to  each  other 
(GM19: policy officer, 2019; GM20: policy officer, 2019). Overall, it was a rather 
dynamic and adaptive process of development:  
“The swimming pool was an important first development, it started to attract 
people  again  to  this  site.  Then  the  shopping  mall  came  here,  the  diving 
center, the climbing center; all pieces of this puzzle. It is a very dynamic 
growing process” (GM20: policy officer, 2019).  
The development process in Beringen is a good example of re-use  
“since the existing infrastructure of buildings and objects is integrated in the 
re-use plans, and former mining buildings get a second live as new functions 
are added” (GM11: tour guide, 2019).  
At the same time, this interviewee however notes that there is still some potential 
with regard  to  this  project  as  there  are  still  some  buildings  left  that  need 
restauration works, or that need to get a new function. The interviewee explains 
that:  
“There are still some buildings which need renovation. These restauration 
works  however  will  need  a  serious  investment.  Thus  the  investment 
company  needs  to  make  a  decision  about  the  amount  of  money  he  can 
invest, versus the amount of cost of the restauration works. In some cases, 
demolishing an old building, and built something new will be more efficient, 
economically  speaking.  The  investment  company  however  needs  to  think 
about the heritage value of a certain object, and about the impact of a new 
building on a historical site” (GM11: tour guide, 2019).

The developments on Be-Mine are not yet integrated in the broader urban context, 
so this is a challenge for the future (GM19: policy officer, 2019). 
This  section  provided  an  overview  of  the  development  process  in  Beringen. As 
described  in  this  section,  the developments  and  heritage  re-use  processes  in 
Beringen took  place  independently  from  the  Grünmetropole  project.  This  is  also 
mentioned during the interviews:  
“The Grünmetropole project didn’t play a role at all in this process”  
and  
“I don’t think that the Grünmetropole project was a stimulator for further 
development in this region” (GM20: policy officer, 2019).  
 
3 Case evaluations 
The mining past influenced the identity and physical landscape of the area of the 
Grünmetropole. The end of the mining industry brought challenges with regard to 
conversion policy and the relicts of the  mining  past.  The  Grünmetropole project 
aimed to contribute to a rehabilitation of this mining past by focusing on tourism 
and  recreation. As  part  of  the  interviews  and  field  work,  we  could  construct  an 
evaluation of the project Grünmetropole from the perspective of the stakeholders. 
The results of these evaluations are clustered around the themes “overall concept”, 
“cross border cooperation”, “activities” and “impact”.  
3.1 Grünmetropole concept  
The  concept  of  the  Grünmetropole  was  to improve  organizational  connectivity 
within the region, and rehabilitate the mining past. A threefold goal was set up: 
renewal  of  the  landscape,  strengthening  identity,  and stimulating tourism  and 
recreation (Bava et al., 2005). The selected goals as such seem to be valued by 
(at least several of the interviewed) stakeholders involved in the implementation 
of  the  project.  One  interviewee  especially  likes  the  idea  to  overcome  cultural 
differences in the cross-border region:  
“I 
appreciate the overall intentions of this project: to connect the region. In 
that regard it’s a pity that the project failed” (GM2: policy officer, 2019).  
Other  interviewees (e.g.  GM1:  tourist  officer,  2019;  GM3:  policy  officer,  2019) 
value about the project that it focused on one central topic, namely the region’s 
mining past:  
“The Grünmetropole  was one of the first projects which really put attention 
to a part of history which we tented to ignore until then. Until then we never 
payed attention to this part of our history, the Grünmetropole project tried 
to shift focus to this period in history” (GM3: policy officer, 2019).

Another interviewee however questions whether the mining history is framed in a 
‘good way’:  
“I can’t hear people say what a ‘cool history’ because this history wasn’t cool 
at all: people died because of ‘miner's lungs’, this story is unknown to the 
wider public” (GM13: former miner, 2019).  
The broad focus and the regional, cross-border scale however appeared to be one 
of the pitfalls of the project. This is stated in no uncertain terms by one of the 
interviewees:  
“The  project  was  too  big,  too  complex.  Historically  speaking  there  is  no 
connection, cooperation  was  contrived,  and  it  was  too  comprehensive” 
(GM21: tour guide, 2019).  
Also with regard to the routes itself, this interviewee thinks that this route was too 
complicated:  
“The route was just not well designed; I think it was too comprehensive and 
not well considered” (GM21: tour guide, 2019).  
Another person underlines this:  
“This project is not well-thought-out: it is designed as a masterplan without 
having an overview of the project as a whole. As a result, not many people 
use the Grünmetropole route and this route does not help with explaining 
the region’s mining past” (GM12: tour guide, 2019).  
In this regard, also the approach of the project didn’t help as it was foremost a 
nice plan which lacked links with other aspect like local communities, or existing 
spatial issues. Although one interview (GM1: tourist officer, 2019) states that  
“it would have been logical to address spatial issues as well”  
it turned out that this was not the case:  
“The Grünmetropole was too much on ‘high-level’, hence it wasn’t able to 
really have impact on the local scale. It was an abstract masterplan which 
was  okay,  but  didn’t  lead  to  something,  there  was  too  much  distance 
between this masterplan and reality” (GM19: policy officer, 2019).  
He adds to this:  
“I remember about the study reports, which were in itself quite interesting, 
but it didn’t lead to a concrete, perceptible project, where we could work on 
at a local scale”.  
The   Grünmetropole   had   no,   or   only   weak   links,   with   other   projects   or 
developments (GM2: policy officer, 2019):  
“The mining history is the most important factor to stimulate a endogenous 
potential  including  aspects  like  spatial  planning,  landscape,  architecture, 
technique, and socio-cultural aspects. I don’t think these aspects were part 
of the Grünmetropole project” (GM16: heritage officer, 2019).

Thus the potential of the project was recognized by various stakeholders at that 
time. But implementation became a disappointment, because it was a promising 
project, but it remained to be only a well-designed promising plan (GM1: tourist 
officer, 2019). A quote from (GM20: policy officer) is included to summarize this 
discrepancy between the plan and the implementation:  
“The Grünmetropole had some potential, there were some nice studies done 
at  that  time.  Besides,  it  was  an  interesting  approach,  but  it  remained  a 
theoretical  story.  When  it  was  implemented,  it  was  a  rather  pathetic 
implementation. It were only some signs, and some information  signs,  but 
these were located in weird locations. The Grünmetropole and the signs were 
like a weird ufo which landed here. Hence, the Grünmetropole is overlooked 
nowadays, I now only remember the name of the project” 
 
3.2 Cross-border cooperation  
Strengthening the region’s identity and stimulating cooperation in the region was 
one of the three goals of the Grünmetropole project. The data from the fieldwork 
once  more  show  a  nuanced  reflection  on  this  cooperation.  Cooperation  in  the 
border  region  is in  general  seen  as  good  thing,  but  the  cross-border  aspect  is 
mentioned as a complicating factor, and also the link with tourism is questionable 
as we will see in this paragraph. 
Several  interviewees  state  that  cross-border  cooperation  is  one  of  the  main 
strengths  of  the  Grünmetropole  project (e.g.  GM3:  policy  officer,  2019;  GM19: 
policy officer, 2019).  
“The  initial  aim  of  this  project  was  to  present  the  mining  history  of  the 
region,  and  to  stimulate  cross-border  cooperation.  These  are  interesting 
things  to  focus  on,  and at  that  time,  we  saw  some  initiatives  that indeed 
focused on cooperation. Of course, there is a language barrier, but still it is 
good  to  cooperate  at  a  regional  scale.  This  project  helped  start  building 
these connections” (GM1: tourist officer, 2019).  
The Grünmetropole project is seen as a  
“valuable learning experience” (GM3: policy officer, 2019)  
and in fact led to cooperation:  
“Cooperation  is  nowadays  quite  good  in  this  region.  We  work  on  several 
international projects” (GM1: tourist officer, 2019).  
Although  cooperation  led  to  some concrete  results,  the  cooperation  within  the 
project Grünmetropole was not always fruitful:  
“International  cooperation  as such  is  a  good  goal  to  set  and  closer 
cooperation in this border region is really needed. Unfortunately however, 
this project is not a good example of international cooperation. Maybe this 
region is just too big to really create cross-border cooperation, or maybe 
too many stakeholders were involved” (GM12: tour guide, 2019).

Other reasons that cross-border cooperation never really came off the ground are 
mentioned by a former Dutch miner:  
“This region is characterized by the perils of village politics, each city has 
his  own  initiatives  and  the  provincial  government  does  not  make  guiding 
decisions,   so   nothing   happens.   Besides,   regional   and   cross-border 
cooperation needs to be organized by the government. Yet, they don’t pay 
attention  to  this  topic  because  it  is  not  interesting  enough,  electorally 
speaking” (GM13: former miner, 2019) 
Next, the cross-border aspect is mentioned as a complicating factor:  
“Historically  speaking,  there  has  never  been a  link  between  the  Belgian, 
Dutch and German mining regions, these are different periods, and different 
approaches used there. The Grünmetropole tried to make a link that’s not 
there. If people want to make a link between the three countries they use 
Facebook to communicate with their German and Dutch friends, but not a 
route like this” (GM21: tour guide, 2019).  
And  also  the  touristic  aspect  is  a  complicating  factor,  as  is  explained  by  both  a 
German and Dutch tourist officer:  
“Cross-border  cooperation with  regard  to  toursim  doesn’t  work,  there  is 
always  competition,  different  interests,  and  cross-border  cooperation  is 
simply very difficult to realize” (GM6: tourist officer, 2019)  
and  
“Although there are some cross-border routes, we see that most routes end 
when  they  reach  the  border.  Our  policy  is  too  much  focused  on  individual 
regions  and  countries  instead  of  connecting  these  routes  by  cross-border 
cooperation” (GM14: guide museum, 2019). 
3.3 Governance and community 
The  discrepancy  between  the  Grünmetropole  plan  and  implementation  was  in  a 
way disappointing. One reason for this could have been the governance approach 
used, which only had little room for incorporating stakeholders and communities’ 
ideas.  Various  interviewees  state  that  the  Grünmetropole  was  a  top-down 
organized project. One person explains that there was no room for participation 
hereby referring to politicians and designers:  
“They remained deaf to what local citizen were saying”  
and  
“If you don’t have academic titles, like professor or doctor, in front of your 
name, than they think you don’t have any knowledge at all; they won’t listen 
to you. But these people do in fact have the most valuable, local knowledge, 
way  more  important  knowledge  than  people  with  academic  titles  like 
professor or doctor can ever acquire” (GM12: tour guide, 2019).  
Other interviewees underline this lack of community involvement, but do mention 
some other ways of participation:  

 
H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Observatory Case report: The Grünmetropole   
31 
 
“I  don’t  think  there  was  community  involvement,  there  were  some 
discussion  groups  with  local  entrepreneurs  who  discussed  the  plans  and 
decided to make a link with this project. And besides organizations such as 
the  ‘VVV  Zuid  Limburg’ made  proposals:  did  you  consider  this,  or  this,  or 
this?  But  citizens  did  not  make  any  proposals,  no” (GM1:  tourist  officer, 
2019).  
Also  local  non-professional  heritage  clubs  were asked  to  propose  objects  or 
locations. But this was only a supporting role, without a decisive say about the 
design of the project. The lack of community involvement is seen as a major pitfall 
as this could have had an impact on the future development of the Grünmetropole.  
“There was a possibility to engage with citizens, if you don’t do that at that 
moment you will never do that. Eventually however such a project has to be 
supported by citizens, because they are the potential users” (GM1: tourist 
officer, 2019).  
Hence, this led to a situation that the Grünmetropole does not live in the minds of 
the people (GM13: former miner, 2019) (GM20: policy officer, 2019). 
At the same time, it should however be noted that the Grünmetropole project has 
been developed and implemented in a period when community-involvement was 
not  a common  practice.  This  is  also  recognized  by  the  interviewees  as  the  for 
instance state that:  
“Nowadays  I  think  there  is  anyways  more  awareness  of  community-
involvement, especially in comparison to 20 or 10 years ago” (GM1: tourist 
officer, 2019).  
Indeed,  nowadays  there  is  more  interest  in  local  stories  and  bottom-up 
developments. One person who works at a Dutch municipality in the area of the 
Grünmetropole, for example explains that with regard to the mining history, they 
now initiate various projects to collect local stories and ideas:  
“Top-down projects, organized by a bigwig, don’t work. Projects only work 
if local stories are incorporated, you actively need to look for these stories 
and incorporate them in your projects” (GM4: policy officer, 2019).  
He for instance mentions the project ‘Jaar van de Mijnen’ (‘Year of the Mines’: a 
year to commemorate the closing of the Dutch mines, 2015) which, according to 
him was very successful because  
“this  was  not  a  top-down  organized  project,  this  project  was  particularly 
interested in local stories. That was one of the strengths of this project”.  
Also with regard to designing a route, like the Grünmetropole routes, these local 
stories and ideas should be taken into account. At least this is what a Belgian policy 
officer explains:  
“It may sound logical to start from a regional story and then select individual 
projects,  but  it  works  the  other  way  round:  you  have  to  start  with  small 
entities, and only then look for a connection within a certain area, or region, 
for example the former mining region” (GM20: policy officer, 2019).

3.4 Activities: tourism 
Within the Grünmetropole project, the goals of revitalizing mining heritage, and 
stimulating tourism were intertwined. A touristic route was implemented to inform 
the public about the mining past in the region: a dedicated route for bicicles and 
one for cars. The routes connect 70 individual heritage or touristic/recreation sites 
– predominantly but not exclusively related to the industrial mining history of the 
region.  
The value of such an approach is recognized by the interviewees who state that it 
is  important  to  inform  the  tourist  about  the  heritage  they  encounter  along  the 
route:  
“Information  leaflets  and  signs  are  needed  to  tell  about  the  history  and 
heritage  of  a  particular  region: it  brings  the  objects  ‘alive’  again” (GM2: 
policy officer, 2019).  
This is underlined by another interviewee, who however questions whether tourists 
actually read the information that is provided:  
“People want to know about the history, or about what they see. Providing 
information along the route is important”,  
And at the same time  
“I don’t think citizens know a lot about the routes in the landscape. I think 
you will be surprised” (GM1: tourist officer, 2019).  
Moreover,  tourists  are  also  misinformed  or  even  fooled  by  touristic  routes  as  a 
Dutch policy officer elaborates:  
“The  mining  past  cannot  be  linked  to  touristic  activities  since  there  are 
almost  no  visible  relicts  of  the  mining  past.  Stories  are  now  made  up  at 
places  were  mining  activities  used  to  be,  but  this  is  not  ‘readable’  for  a 
tourist who comes here. Designing a new route about the mining past is a 
sign of a lack of creativity: if you run out of creativity, you come up with a 
route” (GM3: policy officer, 2019).  
He furthermore states:  
“I think we’re putting too much attention to this mining past. If there is no 
link, you cannot make a link with the past”. 
Although some interviewees questions whether the mining past can be linked to 
tourism,  storytelling  and  region-branding  are  seen  as  important  aspects  with 
regard to tourism:  
“We can think of new storylines to add to the touristic product of our region, 
we must think about locations which are not yet part of our tourist offer and 
include  these  places  into  tourist  offer  by  presenting  a  new  story  at  that 
location” (GM8: policy officer, 2019)  
and  

 
H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Observatory Case report: The Grünmetropole   
33 
 
“We are constantly looking for new storylines to tell, to make and keep this 
region attractive for tourists” (GM7: tourist officer, 2019).  
That  there  are  not  much  relicts  from  the  mining  past  left  doesn’t  seem  to  be  a 
problem:  
“A location can be opened-up to the broader audience by telling the stories 
of that place, objects are usefull for that, but not necessary” (GM7: tourist 
officer, 2019).  
Hence   tourism  is  a   very  important   economic   sector   in   the  area   of   the 
Grunmetorpole, and branding touristic routes is an important aspect. This however 
also leads to competition, as a Dutch tourism officer explains:  
“Routes are really an issue in this region, we always promote that. But now 
there are so many projects, so many routes, we need to choose for certain 
storylines. The Grünmetropole is also a storyline, and if we can, we will try 
to promote this route as well. In the region South-Limburg however, there is 
more  supply  than  just  the  Grünmetropole-route:  we  can  make  various 
storylines  about  for  example  the Mergelandroute, the  hills,  the  wine,  the 
Burgundian lifestyle, our pie’s: there are about 15 powerful storylines that 
we can brand and promote. The mining history is also a powerful storyline, 
absolutely, but we can’t just focus on one storyline, as they did in the Aachen 
region, that we won’t do, because our touristic supply is too important” (GM1: 
tourist officer, 2019). 
 
3.5 Impact 
When asked about the impact of the Grünmetropole routes itself, interviewees are 
either modest or critical.  
“The  Grünmetropole  is  history.  I  was  surprised  when  I  read  that  you  are 
interested in the Grünmetropole. I didn’t expect that anyone would still be 
interested in the Grünmetropole” (GM21: tour guide, 2019).  
This is underlined by two other interviewees. One of them states:  
“The Grünmetropole is now heritage itself” (GM24: heritage officer, 2019).  
Another interviewee underlines this:  
“That’s already a couple of years ago, about 10 years ago, so I don’t know 
exactly. I know about because I remember some of the documents made. 
But  I  don’t  remember  concrete  results  at  this  moment,  except  the 
information signs which can be found at all the mining sites in Limburg, but 
they  work  alienating  I  think.  I  just  remember  the  name  of  the  project. 
Besides,  the  signs  are  still  there,  actually  this  morning  I  spotted  a  sign 
indicating the car route of the Grünmetropole project” (GM20: policy officer, 
2019).  

 
H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Observatory Case report: The Grünmetropole   
34 
 
The alienating effects of the route signs and the mistakes in the design of the route 
itself  are  mentioned  several  times  as  reason  for  the  lack  of  impact  of  the 
Grünmetropole routes.  
“This project never functioned the way it was designed. Also the signs are 
very useless, they are not well designed and besides, they located here in 
Eisden on a location where no tourist or cyclist will notice it. People maybe 
look on internet or websites about information about the mining past, but 
the cyclist who pass by here are either just looks for a place to have a drink 
or  for  some  information,  only  some  of  them  indeed  stop  and  read  the 
information.  That’s  also  due  to  practical  aspects  because  this  info  sign  is 
placed in the wrong direction, no cyclist will notice it” (GM21: tour guide, 
2019).  
Another interviewee notices that:  
“It is just stupid that this route goes from A to B, that does not work. It 
would have been interesting to make a round tour, especially because they 
want to promote cross-border tourism” (GM1: tourist officer, 2019).  
Besides, practical issues, such as money for maintenance works are mentioned as 
reason for the lack of impact of the Grünmetropole routes.  
“Even before the project was well implemented, in turned out that there was 
no  money  available  and  that  maintenance  works  could  not  be  done 
anymore.   This   was   really   a   disappointment,   especially   for   local 
entrepreneurs” (GM1: tourist officer, 2019).  
All in all this led to a situation that:  
“there  are  now  nice maps,  pictures and  information  leaflets,  but  they  are 
not very practical, so where did that bring us?” (GM12: tour guide, 2019).  
Various  interviewees (e.g.  GM1:  tourist  officer,  2019;  GM11:  tour  guide,  2019; 
GM19:  policy  officer,  2019) indeed  state  that  the  information  leaflets  are  not 
distributed any longer, and that the routes are barely used.

4 Reflection 
This section firstly provides a reflection on the OC Grünmetropole by considering 
the data from the case observation from the three thematic lines of OpenHeritage: 
resource     integration,     community     and     stakeholder     integration,     and 
regional/territorial  integration. Outcomes  of  interviews,  field  observation  and 
literature  study  are  complemented  in  this  section  with newspaper  articles  from 
different periods. Finally, we shortly compare the Grünmetropole project to other 
projects related to mining history and touristic routes within the same region. We 
question whether lessons from the Grünmetropole can be of help there.  
Overall,  the case  observations  show  a  somewhat  nuanced  evaluation  of  the 
Grünmetropole  project.  Although  the  overall  perception  is  rather  negative,  it 
should be noted that some interviewees however also note some positive results 
of the Grünmetropole project. The overall intention of the project as well as the 
intention  to  closer  cooperation in  the  region  are  for  example  valued as positive 
aspects.  The  overall  perception is  however  rather  negative. We  can  cluster  this 
negative perception along the three thematic lines of OpenHeritage. 
1. Resource integration 
The  first reason  why  stakeholders  overall  perceive  the Grünmetropole  as 
negative, can be linked to the theme of resource integration. Overall, the 
project  lacked  many practical  aspects  and  agreements.  As  seen  in  the 
previous  section,  interviewees  mention  that  even  at  the  time  of  the 
implementation there were questions about some practical aspects, like the 
placing of information signs and the design of the route itself as it is not 
designed as a round tour. But moreover, interviewees mention the lack of 
practical   agreements   about   for   example   funding,   a   plan   for   the 
Grünmetropole  after  implementation,    and  the  lack  of  agreements  about 
maintenance.  These  aspects  indeed  have  had  a negative  impact  on  the 
success of the Grünmetropole. Nowadays, for example, some information 
signs as well as signs indicating the route, can still be found in the landscape 
whereas others are gone due to vandalism, renovation works, or changes in 
the spatial context (e.g. new infrastructure). Thus tourists who come to the 
region nowadays can’t possibly cycle the entire route as signs are missing, 
but  may  wonder  what  this  route  and  the  signs  are  about.  Maps  or  other 
information  can  however  not  be  found  anymore  since  the  website  is  not 
maintained and information leaflets were never reprinted after they were 
sold out. All in all this resulted in a situation that nowadays the sings and 
the routes work ‘alienating’ as one of the interviewees called it. In fact, as 
is mentioned by several interviewees, the routes are hardly used nowadays, 
and the Grünmetropole is relatively unknown to both locals and tourists. 
 
2. Community and stakeholder integration 
A second reason explaining the negative perception of the Grünmetropole 
project  can  be linked  to  community  and  stakeholder  integration.  When 
looking  at  the  governance  model  applied, the  interviewees frame the 
Grünmetropole as a top-down organized project. Although there were some 
forms of participation included, decision making was done by the designers

of the project. Moreover, local citizens were not included in the design and 
decision  making  process  at  all.  It  is  questionable  whether  the  lack  of 
community involvement should be regarded as a negative aspect, especially 
when realizing that community involvement was not a common practice at 
the time of designing this project. Yet at the same time it is mentioned that 
the lack of local knowledge has had negative impact because local stories 
and bottom-up developments were not included in the plans. This was yet 
another reason leading to a situation that the project didn’t land at the local 
or  individual level.  Nowadays,  community involvement  is  more  and  more 
common practice in spatial developments. Some of the interviewees name 
examples of other, more recent projects (e.g. Jaar van de Mijnen project), 
that  did  incorporate  local  stories  hereby  showing  that  these  projects  are 
better  known  among  local  citizens,  but  also  catalyzed  new,  bottom-up 
developments (Leunissen, 2019). The lack of community engagement with 
the Grünmetropole project can thus be partly explained by looking at the 
applied governance model. Linking the project to local bottom-up initiatives, 
and incorporating communities’ stories would have led to a more interesting 
route, and to more engagement at present day. 
 
3. Regional/territorial integration 
A  third  reason  explaining  the  negative  perception  of  the  Grünmetropole 
project is the approach used within this project. It was namely not only a 
top-down plan in terms of governance model applied, but also in terms how 
it  was  brought  to  this  region.  It  was  a  high-level,  abstract,  visionary 
masterplan which  had almost  no links with  the  existing  spatial  issues,  or 
socio-cultural patterns in the region. The consequences of this were practical 
in terms that it didn’t lead to concrete, perceptible projects at the local scale, 
as one interviewee tells us. This plan was implemented in a way that it was 
just  placed  in  the  landscape  without  having  a  concrete  impact. In  this 
regard, it  should  be  noted  that  also  the  method  used  (i.e.  designing  two 
touristic routes) didn’t really address the issues the region was dealing with. 
This  resulted  in  a  situation  that  the  signs  and  routes  work alienating 
nowadays (as explained above). Moreover however, due to this approach, 
and  the  methods  used,  the  Grünmetropole  never  became  a  catalyzer  for 
stimulating  developments  in  the  region.  In  fact,  because  there  were  no 
concrete  projects  linked  to  the  project,  and  because  the  project  was  not 
linked to other ongoing projects, the Grünmetropole never achieved the goal 
of renewing the landscape.  Next, using this approach once more contributed 
to  the  mismatch  between  plan  and  local  perception  as  it  didn’t  help  the 
region. Hence, as a result not many citizens know about this project or have 
a  personal  link  with  it.  Also  with  regard  to  the  goal  of  cross-border 
cooperation and connecting the mining regions in the three countries, it is 
questionable whether this plan really contribute to these goals. The overall 
impression from the interviews is namely that the project has more or less 
been forced upon the region. Creating a common identity, and organizing 
cross-border  cooperation  are  however  difficult  processes  in  itself  which 
develop over time, instead of bringing it to a region by implementing a plan 
like the Grünmetropole.

The three abovementioned reasons summarizing the negative perceptions of the 
Grünmetropole  project  are  based  on  the  case  observations  (i.e.  data  from  the 
interviews,  and  field  observation).  The  case  observations  thus  represent  value 
judgements  made  at  present  day,  more  than  10  years  after  the  project  was 
designed and implemented. However, an interview with three main stakeholders 
involved   in   the   EuRegionale   2008   project, during   and   directly   after   the 
implementation  of  the  project, can  be  found  in  a  document  reflecting  on  the 
EuRegionale 2008 project (see Vos & Gottschalk, 2009, p. 40). Not surprisingly, 
these  stakeholders  see  the  Grünmetropole  project  as  a  successful  project. 
Especially  with  regard  to  the  cross-border cooperation, and the touristic routes. 
The fact that a cross-border route is developed and implemented is valued, and 
the high number of maps distributed is seen as an indicator for the success of the 
routes. At that time (2009) none of the stakeholders  seems  to worry  about  the 
future  of  the  route  and  maintenance  activities.  They  see  the  cross-border 
cooperation as a lasting activity that will ensure the future of the Grünmetropole 
project, and specifically of the routes (Vos & Gottschalk, 2009). Likewise, also in 
the booklet that discusses the ideas of the Grünmetropole (see Heinrichs et al., 
2008),  the  project  is  regarded  as  very  successful.  It  is  stated  that  the 
Grünmetropole contributed to a feeling of communality in the region, and that it 
stimulated  cross-border  exploration  in  the  sense  that  both  citizens  and  tourists 
started  to  get  interested  in  the  common  history  of  the  region (Heinrichs  et  al., 
2008).  
 
In newspaper articles of that time some more sceptical remarks can be found. In 
an article of De  Standaard (2006), concerns are shared that the Grünmetropole 
will be just a gushy, city-branding story, without concrete ideas or projects that 
will  stimulate  developments  in  the region. Besides,  they  condemn  the lack of  a 
well-thought-out concept underpinning this project as it is mainly framed as a nice 
region-branding   story.   Finally,   they   notice   that   the   Grünmetropole   plans 
degenerates local citizens into users/tourists instead of seeing them as a potential 
source  of  input  of  local  knowledge (De  Standaard,  2006).  In  a  local  Belgian 
newspaper Het Belang van Limburg, we read that critics focus on the idea that the 
Grünmetropole project is too much backwards looking instead of a driver for future 
developments (van  den  Reyt,  2006).  At  the  same  time  reporters  in  various 
newspapers note that stakeholders, and especially those involved in the project, 
nevertheless  expect  a  lot  from  the  project (see  for  example  Swinnen,  2006; 
Swinnen,  2007;  Van  den  Reyt,  2007).  In  2011,  a  reporter  of  the  online  blog 
ZuiderLucht reflects  on  the  Grünmetropole  project  by  interviewing  several 
stakeholders who were involved in the set-up of the project (see van der Steen, 
2011). Although the interviewees in this article name some positive aspects, the 
overall  perception  in  2011  (only  four  years  after  implementation)  is  rather 
negative. The concept of the project is criticized, the cross-border cooperation is 
mentioned as a failed attempt, and it is stated that the project doesn’t live in the 
minds of the people (van der Steen, 2011).  
 
To  sum  up,  although  the  project  is  initially  evaluated rather  positive,  opinions 
changed over time into a more negative perception. Hence, both the reflections in 
the 2006/2007 as the one in 2011 show striking similarities with the remarks of 
the interviewees of today.

Lessons from the Grünmetropole  
 
Considering  these  critical  reflections  on  the Grünmetropole,  one  could  conclude 
that valuable lessons can be learned from the case, especially for other projects 
dealing  with  mining  heritage,  and  other  spatial  developments  with  regard  to 
tourism.  This  however appears  to  be  hardly  the  case.  Even  at  the  time  of  the 
Grünmetropole  project,  other  projects  dealing  with  the  mining  heritage  were 
implemented. In the Belgian mining area for example, a project called ‘Masterplan 
Mijnstreek’ (Masterplan Mining area) dealt with the exact same spatial issues, such 
as  bringing  the  relicts  of  the  mining  past alive again.  This  masterplan  was  also 
produced  in  2008,  yet  there  are  no  links made  with  the  Grünmetropole  project 
(Mols, 2008). But it is even more striking to see that even at present day projects 
are  designed  and  implemented  that  address  almost  the  same  goals  as the 
Grünmetropole project, and propose more or less similar measures with regard to 
spatial planning and tourism. A Dutch policy officer for example elaborates on a 
project called ‘Leisure Lane’. This project is about creating a touristic route that 
connects various attractions and informative stops. So there is a similarity with 
the Grünmetropole project in the sense that it a route and stops are designed. But 
moreover  the  interviewee  explains  that there  are  similarities  in  terms  of 
governance model applied:  
 
“This is once more a top-down organized project, which is forced upon us. 
Maybe  we  should  dust  off  the Grünmetropole  project again,  instead  of 
making new projects” (GM2: policy officer, 2019).  
 
Another interviewee adds to this the example of a project called ‘Mijnspoor’ (Mine 
trail).  This  project  is  about  transforming  a  former  mining  railway  into  a  cycling 
path  which  leads  tourist  along  relicts  of  the  mining  past  in  the  region.  The 
interviewee states:  
 
“I’m wondering for who these projects are intended, I think we’re putting 
too  much  attention  to  the  mining  past.  Designing  a  new  route  about  the 
mining past is a sign of a lack of creativity: if you run out of creativity, you 
come up with a route” (GM3: policy officer, 2019).  
 
He is very skeptical about this route since the route –similar to the Grünmetropole 
routes- tries to make links that aren’t there:  
 
“Tourists will wonder how this route links to the mining past because they 
can’t see any relicts of the mining history. Tourists will say: where is this 
mine you’re talking about?” (GM3: policy officer, 2019).  
 
Also in the Belgian part of the mining region, new routes around the topic mining 
heritage are designed. A project called ‘Kolenspoor’ (cCoal trail) aims at more or 
less the  same  goals (with  the  exception  of  cross-border  cooperation) as  the 
Grünmetropole  project.  These  similarities  in  goals are not  concealed  by  the 
interviewees as one of them says that

“This route has the same aim as the former Grünmetropole project, since 
they both try to connect various mining regions and promote it as one entity: 
we  try  to  link  various  mining  sites  by  using  a  former  mine  trail” (GM18: 
tourist officer, 2019).  
 
Another interviewee adds to this:  
 
“Kolenspoor is again a quest to find each other and to cooperate, and it is 
once more a quest to link the former mining sites” (GM19: policy officer, 
2019).  
 
Many other examples of (cross-border) touristic routes, in all three countries, could 
be named here. These routes not only try to achieve more or less similar goals, 
but also use more or less similar principles like designing a route, making links 
between mining areas, and attracting tourists to mining heritage sites. 
 
Based  on  the  lessons  derived  from  the Grünmetropole,  critical  remarks  can  be 
made  here. Implementing  top-down  designed  touristic  routes  might  result  in  a 
mismatch  with  local  perceptions.  Routes  on  a  map  do  not  necessarily  land  in 
practice and easily remain nice plans only. Moreover, focusing on tourism can be 
a goal as such, but this goal can’t easily be linked to other goals like renewal of 
the  landscape,  community-involvement  or  specific  spatial  heritage  issues. The 
Grünmetropole  does  not  incorporate  communities’  and  individuals’  ideas  of 
heritage in order to land in the existing physical, but also socio-cultural or ‘mental’ 
landscape of the region. this bottom-up perspective on heritage and regional socio-
cultural aspects. The  idea  of  heritage  that  formed  the  basis  of  the  two  touristic 
routes  was  an  object-focused  one.  Therewith  the  Grünmetropole-project  left  no 
room to incorporate other immaterial, or more personal, ideas of heritage. This is 
also one of the main lessons with regard to governance models applied in heritage 
re-use practices. 
 
The question thus remains whether successful examples of routes as an instrument 
for adaptive re-use of heritage through community-involvement can be found, and 
if so, what specific approach and/or conditions made them successful?

1 Introduction 
Marineterrein (Navy Yard) is a historic 13-hectare area close to the Central Station 
in Amsterdam. Built in 1655, it was an innovation area used for the construction 
of  warfare  ships  for  the  Dutch  East  India  Company - which  transformed  The 
Netherlands into a world power and brought much affluence into the country.  
Due to its military nature, this navy base has been sealed off from the rest of the 
city for 350 years.  
In  2013, during the economic crisis, the  Ministry  of  Defence  decided  to  sell  the 
terrain. Because the municipality of Amsterdam could not afford to buy the terrain 
at the time, it led to an innovative collaboration between the national government 
and the municipality – who together opted for a slow transformation of the site, 
led by the historical value of the area, with the aim to create long-term value for 
the city and country.  
Since  2015,  the  area has  been gradually  opening  up  to  the  public  and  will  be 
transformed into a future-proof city quarter.  
 “We  had  these  values - innovation,  connection,  focus - and  I  really  want  to  make 
[Marinterrein] a new kind of area. So not a business district or a start-up place, but to really 
find something new. And I always said, I don’t know what it is because if I would know, it 
would be something that already exists!”  – Liesbeth Jansen, director Bureau Marineterrein.

2 Timeline 
1650 — The Eastern Docklands are built. 
1655 — The Admiralty of Amsterdam establishes “The National Dock” (“Lands 
Werf”) for the construction of warfare ships for the Dutch East India Company.  
1915 — The navy yard closes and the name is changed to Marine Etablissement 
Amsterdam. It becomes a military base for the Royal Navy. 
1968 — The western part of the terrain is demolished to make room for the IJ-
Tunnel. Many new constructions are built such as several educational buildings, a 
conference centre, sports fields and a helicopter landing site. The terrain is 
completely isolated from the city by a wall and satellite images are blurred. The 
terrain functions are largely kept secret. 
1973 — The National Maritime Museum (Scheepvaartmuseum) is established in 
the former warehouse of the Admiralty of Amsterdam, a building from 1655 at 
the edge of Marineterrein. 
2013 — Amidst the economic crisis, the Ministry of Defence decides to vacate 
most of the terrain by mid-2018. A cooperation agreement is signed between the 
government (represented by the Ministry of Defence and the Central Government

3 Story of the Area  
“In this area, the ships were stored, repaired, built, and from that, the Netherlands spread 
out all over the world, in the so-called ‘Golden Age’. It was, I guess you can say, the biggest 
country in the world. (...) But we were, and still are a very big trade nation. That all started 
in this innovation quarter.” – Michiel Buchel, director NEMO Science Museum.  
Marineterrein is a historical area of 13 hectares located on the eastern side of the 
centre of  Amsterdam,  on  one  of  the  Eastern  Islands.  The  Eastern  Islands  were 
built in 1650 to create a new wharf during the “Dutch Golden Age”, to build large 
ships to protect the Dutch East India Company’s fleet. The terrain was used by the 
Admiralty of Amsterdam and later by its successor, the Royal Navy.  
In  1915,  the Navy  Yard  closed and  the  terrain was renamed  to  Marine 
Etablissement Amsterdam. The area’s function changes to education and training 
centres for the Royal Navy.  
In 1962, the western part of the area was demolished to make room for the IJ-
Tunnel, a car tunnel under the river IJ which connects the centre of Amsterdam 
with the Amsterdam North neighbourhood. Several new buildings were constructed 
in  this  period,  to  replace  the  old  ones  from  the  western  side,  such  as  several 
educational buildings, a conference centre, sports fields and a helicopter landing 
site. 
“This has always been a military zone, and it has always been close to the city, in one way 
to protect this heritage of the trading history. Even though it is not always reflected in the 
buildings  themselves,  this  has  always  been  a  very  important  place  in  a  historic  sense.” 
Liesbeth Jansen, director Bureau Marineterrein. 
In recent history, until 2013, the function of the area was secret. The terrain was 
completely separated from the city through the large outside wall, and the satellite 
image above the area was blurred on Google Maps. Sometimes, leading suspects 
or threatened politicians would be hosted on the site.

4 The Initiative 
“The municipality couldn't afford to buy the whole area, so we had to work together with the 
national  government.  And  it’s... I  think  it’s  really  special  that  the  national  government 
decided not to sell for the highest price, but to instead obtain long-term value for the city 
and the country.” – Marlene Rienstra, municipality of Amsterdam. 
In 2013, the Ministry of Defence decided to vacate part of the terrain due to the 
need to cut costs during the economic crisis. The municipality of Amsterdam was 
not  able  to  buy  the  terrain  at  that  point.  Therefore,  the  municipality  and the 
national government decided to sign a cooperation agreement for the development 
of the area in December 2013. 
Because   of   the   economic   crisis,   it   was   opted   for   a guided organic 
transformation approach: starting from existing buildings and infrastructure, the 
area would gradually be open to the public and for programming, as soon as the 
Ministry  of  Defence  would  release  each  building.  Moreover,  the  direction  of 
development was determined based on a few starting points:  
- The area would become an innovation workplace with international appeal 
- The area  would  be  developed  based  on  its  400-year  old  history  of  maritime 
power 
- The area would create added value for the city and would become a meeting 
place 
- The  iconic  value  of  the  area  should  be  in  the  programming,  and  not  in  the 
buildings.  
 
An  innovative  aspect  of  the  contract is  that  it was  decided  to  form  a  new 
independent organisation to lead the transformation, Bureau Marineterrein. With 
a big mandate, it has full decisional power to select the renters and do the site 
programming and the communication in the temporary phase.  
“There was a combination of administrators who had the guts to do it this way. Because this 
way, you take some of the responsibility out of the separate levels. So, the municipality and 
the government don’t have much to say about what’s going on the temporary base, because 
we  have  this  contract  which  says  it’s  out  of  the  municipality’s  hands,  and  it’s  out  of  the 
government’s hands, it’s what we do together. It really gives some space to do what’s good 
for this area...” – Marlene Rienstra, municipality of Amsterdam. 
The method chosen for the development strategy of Marineterrein is a guided 
organic transformation. This means that the transformation is based on an 
area concept (see page 25) and not an urban development plan. Moreover, 
there is no specific end-goal for the transformation.  
Specifically, this means that the programming of the site is done in an 
incremental way: using available resources (eg. rental fees) to organize the 
programming and the maintenance works. The process involves a lot of 
flexibility in steering the process. The step by step approach is considered 
essential to transforming an area into an innovation district – in a rapidly 
changing world, it is imperative to remain flexible.

Liesbeth Jansen was directly appointed as director of this newly 
found   organisation.   She   was   known   for   having   been   the   director   of 
Westergasfabriek  Amsterdam for  over  18  years – a  famous  example  of  organic 
transformation of a site. Her role as director is to lead the first phase of temporary 
programming and establish a local community.  
“Nobody  believes  us  if  we  tell  them  that  we  have  these  contracts  with  the mayor and  the 
deputies,  saying that  the  Marineterrein  should  be developed  in an  organic  way.  Everyone 
thinks, ‘how is that possible?’ ” – Liesbeth Jansen, director Bureau Marineterrein. 
 
In  January  2015,  the  Ministry  of  Defence  vacated  the  first  part  of  the  terrain 
(Voorwerf). The first renters started coming in, and in April 2015 the area became 
officially open to the public, while nevertheless maintaining its quality as a private 
terrain.  In  2016,  a  second  area  was  released  (Kade  West)  and  some  small 
interventions  were made,  such  as  connecting  Kade West  to  city  through a  new 
temporary  bike  bridge.  Many  buildings were renovated,  the  first  restaurants 
opened and slowly the community and the area started to develop according to 
plan.  
In 2017, at the end of the first phase, the transformation up until that point got 
evaluated   by   several   parties   including the   general public,   the adjacent 
neighbourhoods, policy makers and entrepreneurs. The municipality then decided 
to adopt a motion to realize more housing on Marineterrein than initially planned. 
One  year  later,  in  2018,  the  Ministry  of  Defence  announced  that,  for  strategic 
reasons, they  would like  to remain in  the area.  The  area  that  had  already  been 
opened for the public would stay that way, however they would not release any 
new  buildings.  The  situation  at  the  moment  is  still  uncertain  with  regard  to 
adapting  these  two  changes  into  the  future  plans  and  resolving  the  conflict  of 
interests.   
Through the cooperation agreement signed between the national government 
and the municipality of Amsterdam, the two parties decided to give form to 
their cooperation by establishing a joint project organisation to lead the 
development, maintenance and exploitation of the area: Bureau Marineterrein. 
The mandate of the director of this organisation includes the following, 
according to the contract: implementation of the area development, concept 
monitoring, hiring staff, responsibility for the development, liabilities under € 
100.000, alienation of movable property, renting out spaces for a duration of 
under 5 years and for spaces under 1.000 m2 GFA.  
This is considered one of the main success factors so far by all stakeholders of 
the project because it offers continuity to the process, reduces bureaucracy 
and facilitates a hands-on approach to the transformation.

5 Community 
“We started by distilling the ambition and the brand values starting from the description in 
the  cooperation  agreement.  So,  we  came  quite  soon  with  ‘innovation’,  ‘connection’,  and 
‘focus’. And of course, there were other values, but I think these should be always there, 
such as sustainability.” – Liesbeth Jansen, director Bureau Marineterrein. 
Soon after the start of the transformation process in 2014, Bureau Marineterrein 
started  to  bring  more  focus to the  development  by  developing  the three  core 
values of the project: innovation (being able to adapt to a constantly changing 
world), connection (being able to work in cooperation with other sectors) and focus 
(working with really important topics with a wider societal value). These values 
helped to select the tenants, as the management team received more than 900 
applications.   
“It’s about how can you ensure that you get interesting, talented people in your buildings, 
people who can really contribute to your ambition, while at the beginning that ambition is 
not  yet  very  concrete.  What  we  did  was  to  offer  short-term  contracts  so  that  there  is 
flexibility, but at the same time there is also a sort of gut-feeling, that is just very good at 
Liesbeth. You should make sure that the tenants are also people who not only sit here for 
themselves,  but  also  want  to  contribute  something  to  the  city,  and  find  it  exciting  to 
contribute to that development taking place here.” – Jacqueline  Verheugen, communication 
Bureau Marineterrein. 
The  community  working  on  site  at  Marineterrein represents a mix of innovative 
companies  and  organisations.  Currently,  the  area  has  more  than 40 tenants 
including   three   restaurants,   a   hotel,   several   organisations   dealing   with 
sustainability   in   cities,  research  institutes,   start-ups,   digital   innovation   or 
education centres. All contracts with the tenants are temporary, lasting a duration 
of 1-3 years with the exception of tenants who had high investment costs in the 
buildings  themselves  (such  as  Codam  Coding  College  and  restaurants Pension 
Homeland and Scheepskameel), who received 5 to 10 year contracts. Codam is 
since the summer of 2019 the biggest community on site. 
“The number of employees will soon be outnumbered by students, so we will get many young 
people who want different things on site, who are curious about everything happening here, 
who  want  to  collaborate  and  do  internships,  who  are  less cautious  and  that  is...  now  the 
golden  age  is  about  to  start,  I  think”. – Jacqueline  Verheugen, communication  Bureau 
Marineterrein. 
The main role of Bureau Marineterrein is to ensure that there is interaction between 
the  numerous  community  members  and  to  think  of  ideas  and  formats  which 
contribute both to the aims of the transformation and the individual aims of the 
organisations  involved.  Usually,  Bureau  Marineterrein  aims  to  start  initiatives 
which  would  be  later  on  adopted  by  individual  organisations.  According  to  the 
initiators, the most important elements of this sort of community building are time 
to experiment and flexibility to adapt what is not very successful or appropriate 
for  the  site.  Moreover,  the  initiators  underlined  the  importance  of  giving 
community  members  some  time  to  settle  in  before  cross-fertilization can  start, 
which can take up to 3 years. 
“Without the community, you can never develop an identity. For me, it really starts with a 
selection  of  a  community.  Community  members.  And  then  comes  the  selection  of  a 
programme.” – Liesbeth Jansen, director Bureau Marineterrein.

6 Activities 
 Open day in 2014. Photo by Arjen Veldt. 
Several activities are organized in order to bring the community together, create 
cohesion and involve them in the programming of the site. Some examples: 
• Community drinks – organized periodically, every time in a different building 
on site. The aim is to create cohesion in the community. Mostly employees 
participate. Sometimes   organised   together   with   a   workshop   or   a 
masterclass given by one of the community members. 
• Directors lunch – a new initiative to invite the directors of the organisations 
on site for lunch to brainstorm about new ideas or spaces.  
• Online community tools – from a weekly newsletter for community members 
to Slack, Instagram etc.  
By selecting the core values and the tenants, several common threads started to 
appear  as  potential  themes  for the  area’s programming.  The  aim  of  the 
programming  is  to  address  city  and  country  challenges  and  to  propose  new 
solutions.  The  area  profiles  itself  as  a  place  where  innovations  are  not  only 
invented but also tested and put into practice.  
“This area only has small spaces, the biggest space can hold 60 people. It’s only offices. So, 
I  thought,  we  will  not  have  festivals  here.  At  first  no  one  believed  it,  ‘every  place  in 
Amsterdam  has  festivals’.  We  have  one  now,  that  is  the  Amsterdam  Water  Games.  It’s 
organized by Pension Homeland, to involve the neighbourhood. That’s one party in the year. 
It’s  big,  and  the  rest  is  all  very  serious  business” – Liesbeth  Jansen,  director  Bureau 
Marineterrein.

Programming Themes 
The  current  themes  approached  by  Marineterrein  in  their  programming  are 
housing,  water,  learning,  traffic  and  health. The  aim  of  the  themes  is  to 
stimulate  cooperation  between  community  members  and  to  stimulate  them  to 
develop programmes together.  
“There is having businesses on the terrain, and there is having a community. As long as the 
tenants do not work together, it is a business park and not an active community.” – Anikka 
Fulop, project assistant Bureau Marineterrein. 
 
At  the  moment,  the theme learning is  considered  the  most  relevant  at 
Marineterrein. As  the  world  is  changing  faster  and  faster with  new  technology 
developments,  learning  is  considered a  key  theme  in  helping  the  city  and  the 
neighbourhood adapt to new realities.  
Many community members at Marineterrein deal with the theme of learning such 
as Codam (a   non-conventional   school   for   coding), GrowthTribe (teaching 
companies  how  to  hack  their  growth) and Cinekid (who  has  an  awareness 
programme for children and social media). 
The  programme  related  to  learning  includes meet-ups  (such  as  “successful 
dropouts”), teaching modules designed to introduce teachers to new skills for the 
future  (such  as  project-based  education  and  peer  to  peer  learning)  and  an 
expedition about the future of learning (five community members give workshops 
on future skills to a broad public).  
“And then you always hope that the community will embrace this and continue it themselves, 
because  they  also  get  something  out  of  it.  I  think  this  is  important  when  you  work  with 
communities, that you don’t just ask them to do things, they really need to see the added 
value  for  themselves,  be  it  to  have  more  students,  or  more  business  to  business 
connections.” – Anikka Fulop, project assistant Bureau Marineterrein. 
Living Lab 
Since 2019, Marineterrein also hosts a Living Lab, where community members and 
other organisations can test solutions for future-proof cities. A great advantage of 
the area is that it is a private terrain which is publicly accessible, meaning that it 
is easier to test many developments before applying them to public space.  
“We always experiment with the aim that the city and the country and the region benefits 
from it. So we are looking for experiments that have a chance of upscaling.” – Anikka Fulop, 
project assistant Bureau Marineterrein. 
“We have started to set up a living lab, so we have created spaces where we can test things 
in the open, like vehicles without a driver. We also see it as a place where we cannot just 
gather opinions, but also gather real data – what solutions do work? For example, about the 
work on cleaning the water, there were still some sewers coming out on that water, which 
made it too dirty to swim in. So the Marineterrein found out where this comes from, tested 
every day, and now people are swimming!” – Michiel Buchel, Director NEMO Science Museum. 
Temporary programming is an essential part of organic development. It 
involves the testing of possible uses of a building or site by organising various 
events and pilot actions. Usually, this type of programming uses few resources 
and it is essentially a series of tests which can be scaled up if enough 
alignment is found with values of the site or the community. Moreover, 
programming is an important tool in branding a site.

Future Transformation 
As mentioned above, Marineterrein is currently being involved in an organic way, 
meaning that the development of a community and of programming for the site 
are  the  leading  principles  at  the  moment.  However,  the  end  goal  is  to  also 
transform the site from a physical perspective, and the current phase gives many 
of the components for the transformation later on.   
"There  won’t  be  one  moment  when  the  temporary  phase  will  end.  It  will  be  an  ongoing 
process and buildings will follow programming, and not the other way around.” - Marlene 
Rienstra, municipality of Amsterdam. 
“I think the advantage of an organic development approach is that you take the time to find 
the value of the area together with stakeholders, and by doing that together, people start 
feeling  ownership  for the area.  (...)  if  you  take  the time,  you  can  really  get many people 
involved. This also has the disadvantage that you don’t get to see results quickly and people 
will  keep  on  asking  questions  about  the  plans.” – Anikka Fulop, project  assistant  Bureau 
Marineterrein.

7 Context  
 The Wider Area - Oosterdok 
Besides working on building a strong community on site, Bureau Marineterrein is 
also working on creating a wider community who feels connected to the site. One 
example is Expeditie Oosterdok. Oosterdok is the wider neighbourhood in which 
Marineterrein is situated, which shares the naval history of Marineterrein. 
In  2017, Bureau  Marineterrein  initiated  a  walking  route  (Expedition  Oosterdok) 
with several cultural organisations in the neighbourhood, such as NEMO Science 
Museum, The National Maritime Museum, the Conservatorium, The Central Library 
of Amsterdam etc. Later on, several companies in the neighbourhood connected 
to the initiative, such as Booking.com, TomTom, Oracle and others.  
Slowly,  the  whole  neighbourhood  is  starting  to  get  the  image  of  an  innovative 
quartier of the city and are beginning to work together. For example, once a year, 
all organisations now set up an open day where people from the neighbourhood 
and the public at large can come and explore all developments of the area. 
“If  you  want  to  collaborate,  you  need  to  understand  who  is  the  other.  We  all  have  our 
autonomous responsibilities. Which is, for us, to keep the museum healthy and get enough 
visitors, and work for our collections. But we also have a second layer on top of that, that is 
to say ‘we live in this street and we work together’. And then, there’s the third level, which 
is  ‘we  share  a  mission;  we  have  to  take  care  of  our  planet’.  And  we  all  have  our  own 
possibilities, or limitations, but that’s a sort of second umbrella or third umbrella that lies on 
top of it. If you want to join the hub, you have to join these visions and missions. “– Michiel 
Buchel, director NEMO Science Museum.

 The Neighbourhood – The Eastern Islands 
The  residential  neighbourhood  surrounding  Marineterrein  used  to  be  a  rather 
different neighbourhood in the centre of Amsterdam, characterized by many social 
housing projects built between the 70’s and the 90’s. Currently in the process of 
rapid gentrification, as the rest of Amsterdam is, many of these social houses are 
being sold. In recent history, there have been some known cases of gun violence 
amongst youth groups from the area.  
Some of the residents who moved in before the 90’s have been very active in city 
policies  and  development  plans  through  active  civil  engagement  and  lobbying 
throughout the years. These residents, together with some newcomers, form very 
organised social structures in the neighbourhood and have been very vocal in the 
transformation of Marineterrein to date.  
In 2013, when the Ministry of Defence announced that they will vacate the terrain, 
the neighbourhood created “Neighbourhood platform Kattenburg Marineterrein”. 
“Its  main  aim was  to  prevent that  the  Marrineterrein  was  developed  without a  connection 
with  the  existing  area.  We  wanted  to  be  connected  to  social  coherence,  but  also  that 
Kattenburg should profit from development here.” – Jeroen Verhulst, local resident. 
Many members of the neighbourhood appreciated that the municipality  and  the 
government appointed an independent organisation, Bureau Marineterrein, to 
use the buildings and the facilities already on site and that they opted for a slow 
development approach, which gives the neighbourhood more time to react in the 
process of defining the definitive functions on site.  
 
Bureau  Marineterrein organises a  bimonthly  session  with  the  neighbourhood, 
where  the  municipality  would also  present  plans or  give  information  on  various 
processes. Also, the neighbourhood would invite various contact persons from the 
municipality  and  the  bureau  to  their  local meetings,  which  usually  give  better 
results  and  more  focused  discussions. However,  the  residents  were  initially  not 
very  happy  with  how  the  municipality  gave  form  to  local  participation  in  the 
physical transformation of the site and wanted to become more involved in the 
actual plan-making process.  
“We are trying to make a contract with how to relate to each other. So, how do we relate 
with the surrounding, with the neighbourhood, how do they want to participate in this project, 
and also what’s a non-negotiable topic? Because the municipality, the decision makers, need 
to provide a framework for discussion.” – Marlene Rienstra, municipality of Amsterdam.  
Bureau Marineterrein, the municipality and the neighbourhood are currently doing 
research into how to better formalize the participatory process through a project 
(R-link), which looks at possibilities for developing a ‘neighbourhood’ contract. The 
Often, organic transformation processes have a slower pace. This means that 
no major investments are made in the first years. Instead, the first years are 
used to test some ideas for the area, develop a community and discover the 
type of programming needed for the specific site. This gives stakeholders time 
react on plans or developments and often results in high community 
engagement.

aim is to come up with new ways of interacting with a wider local 
community that goes beyond the already active local inhabitants.   
“There’s a lot of pressure and all the stakeholders have very different interests and goals. 
(...)  And  for  me  it’s  really  a  search  to  find  the  right  groups  and  participants  for  the 
conversation, because it’s not only for the people who live around, it’s for the whole city.” – 
Marlene Rienstra, municipality of Amsterdam. 
An important activity in creating a relation with the neighbourhood and with the 
city  of  Amsterdam  as  a  whole  was  the  opening  of  a  new  swimming  spot  in 
Amsterdam,  at  Marineterrein,  once  the  boardwalk  was  set  up.  Though  the 
swimming area is not yet official, various organisations at Marineterrein have been 
testing  and  improving  the  way  water  quality  can  be  measured  and  improved 
through a Living Lab. The aim is to make this an official swimming spot.  
“The funny thing is, if the weather is nice, instantly the whole neighborhood, and the whole 
city knows to find this area, because they are all here, swimming  in the  harbor,  so that’s 
very interesting.” – Liesbeth Janson 
Other activities which are organized directly for the neighbourhood summer camps 
(activities organized by the community members for children and teenagers from 
the  neighbouring  areas)  but  also  the  main  festival  on  site,  Amsterdam  Water 
Games, organized by the restaurant Pension Homeland together with people from 
the nearby neighbourhoods. 
“I  think  that Pension Homeland  and  the  water  have  been  very  important  in  getting  the 
neighbourhood  to  come  here,  and  to  create  a  bond  with  them.  The  terrain  has  been 
completely closed off for 150 years and (...) even though the door opened, we really had to 
pull  the  neighbourhood  in  at  the  beginning.  Now  we  are  a  few  years  later  and  of  course 
everyone knows where to find us now. But in the beginning that wasn't all that obvious.” – 
Koen Vollaers, founder Pension Homeland. 
Some of the community members such as Codam Coding School and the upcoming 
chef’s  school  are  being  perceived  as  very  interesting  to  connect to  the  local 
residents  and  especially  youth  from  the  direct  neighbourhood.  Also,  all  the 
initiatives related to transforming the area into a sustainable district are supported 
by the surrounding community.

8 Buildings / Complex / Site  
 
 Community at Marineterrein. Photo by Alina Tomescu.  
Part  of  the  site  at  Marineterrein  is  currently  still  being  used  by  the  Ministry  of 
Defence, and that area is separated from the publicly accessible area by a fence 
across the whole territory. The parts which are open for public are Voorwerf (at 
the main entrance to the site) and Kade West, which in the meantime has been 
connected  to  the  city  through  a  temporary  bridge.  One  building  which  also 
historically belongs to the marine complex but which is not currently a part of the 
transformation process is the former warehouse from the 17
th
 century, currently 
hosting the National Maritime Museum and which is a protected monument. 
Only one national monument is located on the Marineterrein site itself, namely the 
gatehouse at 003, a 100-meter-long building separating the area from the city, 
dating from 1655. Also, buildings 024 (built in 1860) and building 031 (beginning 
of   20
th
 century)   fall   under   protected   cityscape   regulations.   Most   other 
constructions  were  built  after  1960  and  are  characterized  by prefabricated 
constructions and standardization. (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2018)

Renovations

Many of the buildings on Marineterrein have been adapted to host new functions 
– most have become offices or horeca businesses. As most of the buildings were 
highly functional 60’s buildings, they were relatively easy to transform into office 
spaces with minimal interventions.  
A few interventions were made in order to facilitate better access in the area, such 
as signage, a new bridge and a board walk. Also, some buildings were renovated 
to  various  degrees  in  order  to  make  them  suitable  for  new  functions.  Three 
examples are presented below.

One   of   Marineterrein’s direct neighbours   is   NEMO   Science 
Museum, the 5
th
 most popular museum in the Netherlands. The museum focuses 
on interactive ways to explore scientific topics for families, children and schools. 
In 2018, NEMO decided to extend across the water and open an extra space on 
the Marineterrein. 
“For us the studio is a place where we can experiment with other types of stories, targeted 
at adults. Whereas in the NEMO museum we develop the exhibitions ourselves, in the NEMO 
studio we want to develop them together with partners from the terrain, but also with other 
organisations, NGO’s or universities.” – Michiel Buchel, director NEMO Science Museum. 
The  building  (dating  from  the  1960s)  has 1400  sqm and  was  originally  a sports 
hall for the military troops. The transformation of the site was done in a circular 
way, so that it would be in sync with the ideas presented in the museum, but also 
because it was cost effective. Furniture was bought second hand and many of the 
elements  which  were  removed  during  the  renovations  were  donated  to  offices, 
schools, a mosque or the fitness garden on Marineterrein. 
“We didn’t  have  very  big  budget, so  we sort  of  had to  convert  it  in a  very basic  way. We 
wanted to be able to host 1000 people there, so we had to change the infrastructure. We 
could not really change the building in itself because it’s part of the architecture of the other 
buildings around it. So, we came up with the solution with the architect, to put a little extra 
layer  in  front  of  it  that  we  can  easily  replace,  because  we  can  only  rent  space  there  for 
temporary periods (5 years). So, we had to be very practical and pragmatic in terms of how 
much can we invest.” - Michiel Buchel, director NEMO Science Museum. 
The NEMO Studio officially opened in July 2019 with an exhibition on the Future of 
Food.  The  objective  of  the  studio  is  to  translate  important  scientific  and 
technological developments into accessible exhibitions aimed at citizens, so that 
they can not only form opinions, but also contribute to the solutions.  
“One of the things that I learnt and that struck me most was – if you do a project and you 
do it together with your neighbours and people are motivated by the goal, there’s enormous 
amounts of energy that comes free. People give things, you know, people work many more 
hours than they are paid for... and this inspires me enormously. Because this is the sort of 
energy, positive energy that we will need to make real change. (...) I think that’s where the 
heritage can play a role - to bring people together” – Michiel Buchel, director NEMO Science 
Museum. 
 
 
For the adaptive reuse of the building hosting NEMO De Studio, circularity is a 
central theme: 100% second hand furniture, the façade is made of spare 
materials from the car industry, there is a 100% recyclable floor and a pay per 
use light system. Moreover, most elements removed from the building were 
donated to organizations on Marineterrein or in Amsterdam. ("Circulaire gevel

 Pension Homeland

The first publicly accessible space to open on Marineterrein was Pension Homeland 
– a  hotel,  restaurant  and  brewery. Inspired  by  the  location  of  building  006,  a 
former  lodging  for military officials,  Koen  Vollaers  and  Astrid  van  der  Meiden 
decided to transform it into an accommodation for people working on site and a 
restaurant. Pension Homeland  plays  an  important  role  in  bringing  together  the 
community on site, the defence authorities, the neighbourhood and the city. 
“As far as the brewery is concerned, that was very exciting, because of course that was not 
entirely in line with the objective of the site. But I also thought it was especially important 
to  actually  produce  something,  not  only  digital  things.  Because  this  also  makes  it  more 
accessible to other people, because it brings life, literally and figuratively. You have to be 
extremely  careful  if  you develop  a site  like  this,  that  it  does  not  become  dead  site  at  six 
o'clock when everyone is gone. You have to find a very good balance between public things 
and  office-like  functions,  and  I  think  the  brewery  also  helps  with  that.” - Koen  Vollaers, 
Pension Homeland.  
The renovation took much longer than originally planned, as the building was in a 
rather bad condition, with traces of asbestos. The costs also got out of hand (1.4 
million euro, while the initial investment was estimated at 1 million euro), but the 
owners  were motivated  to  continue  investing  in  the  place.  Many  of  the  original 
elements  were  kept,  and  the  additions  respected  the  60’s  heritage:  simple, 
functional rooms with furnishings from the same period. Feeling it was too sterile, 
the owners decided to bring their private art collection into the building. 
“There is also another reason why Pension Homeland looks like this. In the beginning, there 
were some difficulties with the Ministry of Defence, they were not so comfortable with all the 
civilians coming on their terrain. So, we thought, we have to make a place where they feel 
at home. And that really worked well, because there are a lot of old militaries who came here 
and they said ‘wow, how beautiful it has become here, we used to sleep here!’. And that has 
really helped in the mutual tolerance and I think it has opened some doors.” - Koen Vollaers, 
Pension Homeland.

An important landmark in the transformation of Marineterrein is also the arrival of 
Codam, a revolutionary programming school based on the concept of the French 
school 42. 
“It’s quite revolutionary actually. It is completely tuition-free, it’s open 24/7, we don’t require 
any kind of experience or former diploma, anything... You can just give it a try and come. 
Here, we don’t have any teachers, we don’t have any planning, we don't have exams and 
things like that. Everything’s different. We use peer learning, so the students are going to 
learn from each other and with each other, so that’s a lot of fun.” – David Giron, Codam. 
About 25% of the students are from the Amsterdam. Even though being connected 
to  the  local  neighbourhood  was  not  an  initial  objective  of  the  transformation  of 
Marineterrein,  the  commissioners  are  beginning  to  see  the  benefits  of  a  better 
connection  with  the  community. As  the  nearby  neighbourhood  is  known  for  a 
relatively high percentage of youth at risk, with drugs, violence and early drop-out 
of school, the presence of Codam could offer solutions.  
The building transformed by Codam used to be an administrational building with 
narrow  hallways  and  dark  rooms.  Through  extensive  interventions,  it  was 
transformed into a modern school in about 6 months. The building also attracted 
the  attention  of  the militaries, and  students  sometime  play  football  with  the 
soldiers in the military area: 
“Often as the militaries go past the barracks, some step in and ask us about what we are 
doing here. And we show them around, and they get very excited! And now it’s sort of this 
thing where the traditional world of the military and this crazy world of Codam, it’s sort of 
colliding and it’s a very special thing. Which is really interesting, because there’s a lot of IT 
jobs also, for the safety for the country, so that’s a beautiful way to work together.” – Lisa 
Stamm, Codam.

9 Heritage  
I find some of the buildings on site really great. But actually what I find even more special is 
the story we want to continue to tell, as an area that has always been of great value to the 
city, region and country. A lot of value has been created from here and we aim to do that 
again. – Anikka Fulop, Bureau Marineterrein 
Already in the area concept developed in 2013, it is mentioned that Marineterrein 
is iconic through values, not architecture. Most stakeholders agree that the 
terrain in  itself has  an  important  historical  value  for  Amsterdam  and  the 
Netherlands. However,  the  attachment  does  not  always  reflect  in  the individual 
buildings on site. 
Only one building remains from the time of the Admiralty of Amsterdam, namely 
building 003, the gatehouse separating the terrain from the Kattenburg street and 
neighbourhood.  While  some  of  the  stakeholders  (such  as  the  inhabitants  of  the 
neighbourhood on the other side) would rather have more access points towards 
the Marineterrein from the main street, there are also stakeholders who appreciate 
the sort of mystery given by having this wall around the terrain and believe that 
this could help maintain the terrain as a green oasis in the middle of Amsterdam. 
“I think that you should aim for the highest possibility in choosing a function for a heritage 
site,  to  give  it  meaning  to  as  many  people  as  you  can  think  of.  In  this  phase,  for 
Marineterrein, it is quite difficult. At the moment I am thinking about the best destination for 
the gatehouse. Currently it hosts offices, but it is a very special building, so I believe it should 
have a public function. But in order to develop such a function, you’d need to invest a lot in 
this building, and you cannot do it for 5 or 10 years, it should be at least 12 or 15 years. 
That’s difficult in the temporary phase.” – Liesbeth Jansen, director Bureau Marineterrein. 
There  are  also  two  buildings,  024  (built  in  1860)  and  031  (built  in  early  20
th
 
century), which are protected under the protected cityscape measures, and will 
therefore also be kept as such.  
For the rest, many buildings on site date from the 60’s and have a highly functional 
character. Here, opinions are divided about whether these should be kept in the 
next phase of the transformation of the Marineterrein, which will involve physical 
development  of  the  terrain.  The  Monuments  and Archaeology office  of  the 
municipality  of  Amsterdam  evaluated  the  historic  value  of  the  buildings  and 
recommended that most of the buildings, including the ones from the 60’s, should 
be kept, to showcase the historic context.  
“But  it’s  hard to  keep  all  the buildings  when  you  have  to  increase  the density  of  an  area. 
Because they are really in a strange setting, they just... the defence authorities, they didn’t 
care about urban planning, they just spread the buildings over the whole area.” – Marlene 
Rienstra, municipality of Amsterdam.  
“As heritage, the buildings don’t have that much value I think. But the buildings in use now, 
were renovated, and they look better now, so why should we demolish them? It's easier to 
keep  them.  But  there  are  more  buildings  hardly  in  use  now.  They  can  be  demolished...” 
Jeroen Verhulst, local resident. 
“I actually think every building here is heritage, because it simply stands here. (...) Yes, I 
think every shed and every building is actually a shame to demolish, because then you also 
have to build something new for it” – Koen Vollaers, Pension Homeland.

Few buildings from the 60’s were transformed more thoroughly, 
such  as  006  (Pension  Homeland),  039  (Codam)  and  027E  (transformed  on  the 
occasion of the Dutch EU presidency). Many stakeholders have started to become 
attached  even  to  these  buildings  or  to  not  see  the  use  in  demolishing  them. 
Especially when it comes to Pensioen Homeland, the adaptive reuse managed to 
put  the  historic  context  of  the  buildings  in  a  new  light,  which  made  many 
stakeholder appreciate the style of these buildings much more.  
“Homeland, it should actually be listed as a monument I think. It is really architecture built 
in  a  very  special  way  and  also  shows  a  very  good  picture  of  buildings  from  the  sixties. 
Precisely because of those straight lines, precisely why some people would find this an ugly 
building, there are also other people who think this is a very beautiful building because of its 
spirit of the time.”- Koen Vollaers, Pension Homeland.  
Many of the interviewees saw (built) heritage as a starting point for the design and 
programming,  which  gives  direction to  the  transformation  on  the  site.  They  all 
agree that heritage, both immaterial and material, add a lot of value to the area. 
However, heritage is perceived as most valuable when it can find a new spot in 
contemporary times.

“I think heritage gives some backbone to what we do here, because otherwise you can do 
whatever  you  want  here...  I  think  the  value  of  heritage,  you  can  see  it  when  you  can 
incorporate it in modern times.  it shouldn’t be a museum; it should be part of the city. And 
for  that, maybe the buildings will  remain, but  you always  have  to do something  with the 
function of the buildings. And for that, when you do that, it has value. If you don’t, I think it 
will lose its value.” – Marlene Rienstra, municipality of Amsterdam. 
The decision of the defence authorities to remain on a large part of the area is also 
perceived as a double-edged issue. On the one hand, it gives less room for the city 
to  develop.  If  13 hectares  could  have  really  become  an  important  new 
neighbourhood for Amsterdam, this will be more difficult to achieve having only a 
part of the site.  On the other hand, having the military on site adds to the special 
character of the site and is also adds value with regards to continuity and heritage. 
However, the main challenge will be to manage to involve this new key stakeholder 
in the vision for the site.

“Maybe it’s a good development that the defence part is becoming bigger 
than what we envisioned at the beginning. Because in that way you can relate also physically 
to the history, and take it to a next level. But only if we can cooperate with them, if they 
decide they want to be part of the innovation environment.” - Marlene Rienstra, municipality 
of Amsterdam. 
“In  a  way,  there  have  been  a  lot  of  inventions  here,  it’s  always  been  an  international 
community, so it’s interesting... Most innovations start in the military, like the computer, all 
kinds  of things. In a  way,  it  took  a  while  to  connect  with  the  Ministry  of Defence on this 
subject, but it's sort of slowly coming.” – Liesbeth Jansen, director Bureau Marineterrein. 
“Personally, I actually find the militaries nice, because it makes it different. It makes it weird 
and exciting and also somehow very safe.” – Koen Vollaers, Pension Homeland. 
10 Regulations and Policy  
Marineterrein is a very peculiar area from many points of view in the context of 
policy  and  regulations,  which  allowed  for  the  transformation  to  take  place  in  a 
special way. There are a few interesting developments and instruments which have 
laid the foundation of this way of working. 
In  2012,  the  government  together  with  the  municipality  commissioned  several 
documents that laid the foundation of the cooperation agreement: A recognition 
study (“verkenningstudy”) in 2012 to see the development potential of the area, 
as  well  as  an area  concept (“gebiedsconcept”)  and  a  development  strategy 
(“strategienota”).  
 
In the cooperation agreement, this “slow transition” was estimated to last for 
10-15  years  and  the  aim  was  that  it  would  lead  the  later  transformation  of  the 
area. In the first phase (2013-2017), no major interventions and no well-defined 
urban  plans  would  be  developed.  The  transformation  would  happen  gradually, 
based  on  the  area  concept  and  not  on  an  urbanistic  plan. Another  important 
principle  of  the  first  years  was  that  the  value  development  process  would  take 
place for the area as a whole and not for the individual buildings.   
A key success factor was also that, in the cooperation agreement, the two parties 
(the  government  and  the  municipality) decided  to  appoint an external  party 
(Bureau Marineterrein, led by Liesbeth Jansen) to lead the temporary phase. 
 “[Something that was really important for the development] is the fact that in the contract 
it  was  put  down  that  we  shouldn’t  do  the  transformation  ourselves,  but  have  this  project 
bureau instead, an organization which has the mandate to do the things thought to be right 
for this area. That’s really important. The normal decision making process for a municipality 
and also  for  a  national  government  takes  a  very  long  time  and  then  you  are  not able  to 
anticipate the chances and the opportunities you see on the terrain.” – Marlene Rienstra, 
municipality of Amsterdam. 
The area  concept is  described  as  “not  an  end-goal,  but  a  compass  for  the  organic 
transformation of Marineterrein. It provides guidance for the (temporary) development 
but also offers the flexibility to respond to the needs of society”. The area concept of 
Marineterrein  was  to,  just  as  in  the  past,  create  a  context  where  innovations  can 
originate  and  which  in  turn  contribute  for  a  better  city.  Three  key  themes  were 
identified: (1) Maritime power, (2) Water park, (3) Innovative Workplace.

When the Ministry of Defence decided to stay on a larger part of 
the terrain, despite the contract between the government and the city, the parties 
needed  to  start  renegotiating  the  context  of  the  development.  In  this  specific 
situation, having an independent organisation to lead the development was also 
very beneficial for the transformation, as it ensured continuity. 
“I have a very broad mandate, I can do almost anything except giving way too much money 
or organize a foundation or a limited company... and besides that, I’m completely free in the 
tenants I choose, in the contracts I sign, in the content... These kinds of projects don’t go 
very smoothly, easily, it’s always a bumpy road. So we sort of, are the continuous factor in 
the  development,  while  they  [the  government  and  the  city]  meanwhile  are  in  a  complex 
situation of coming to an agreement.” – Liesbeth Jansen, director Bureau Marineterrein. 
After 2017, the transformation would then enter a second phase (2017-2027) – 
still characterized by temporary exploitation and experimentation, however also 
starting to better define the concept, the area and the zoning plan. After 2027, it 
was  hoped  that  the  transformation  would  be  definitive  and  that  most  buildings 
would be assigned definitive functions.    
 “In the beginning... there was no zoning plan, so for every need in the city, everyone said 
‘oh!  Marrineterrein!’.  It  took  us  so  much  time  to  fight  this,  ‘no  you  should  not  make  the 
Marrineterrein the  dumping ground  to  put  whatever  you  don’t elsewhere  have space  for’. 
People have realised that, it’s not on that level anymore. And of course, the government is 
much less politically influenced than the city. The city, you notice very well the periods of 
elections.” – Liesbeth Jansen, director Bureau Marineterrein. 
While  the  regulatory  context  was  very  special,  which  allowed  the  area  to  be 
developed in a slow, organic way, it is worth mentioning that another key success 
factor was that the creative civil servants working on this area had courage to 
try something different in the governance process.  
“It needs guts to do this, but I think decision-making in the future should be like this, because 
it’s kind of old fashioned to do it the way we are used to do normally. Because who are we, 
civil servants and municipality, to decide what’s good and working for a long time? Because 
normally, we make plans, and then 10 years later, we realize the plans Then you’re always 
behind. Then you always make plans that are outdated at the time you realize them. So, I 
think it’ necessary to do it this way.”- Marlene Rienstra, municipality of Amsterdam.

11 Financial Model 
The initial budget for Marineterrein was 6.5 million euro, made available by the 
national government  and  the municipality.  This  budget  was  used  for  several 
infrastructure investments  (such  as  a  bridge,  a  boardwalk, the  renovation  of 
building  027E  in  the  context  of  the  EU  presidency) and  for  starting  up  the 
organisation Bureau Marineterrein. 
However, soon after the buildings started being rented out, the rent was enough 
to cover all the management and exploitation costs. An important factor to take 
into account is that Bureau Marineterrein does not pay any rent in turn.  
“If you rent out cheaply, you can be accused of “irregular subsidy”, that you subsidize people 
in a way that is not legit, so we really had to ask for market value. They were very surprised 
that we managed to do that. So the income we had is higher than their expectations. So we 
could  also  draw  some bigger  projects  like  the  board  walk  and  the  bridge  and... but  the 
exploitation and the maintenance we can also do ourselves from the rent.” – Liesbeth Jansen, 
director Bureau Marineterrein. 
12 Communication 
“We have been very careful with our communication strategy (...) as in we actually chose not 
to  have  one,  or to  have  a  very  sober  one.  So,  the website  was also not meant  to create 
interest, because we first wanted some time to define our values before we would come out 
of the closet.” - Anikka Fulop, project assistant Bureau Marineterrein Amsterdam.  
The  first  step  of  defining  the  communication  strategy  for  Marineterrein  was 
positioning – assessing what are the real values and strengths of the site, and how 
these  are  different  in  the  context  of  the  city. In  the  first  instance,  the 
communication was focused on the commissioners, the city and the government, 
to have a very transparent process.  
Moreover, at the beginning of the process, all eyes were on Marineterrein. Having 
so many stakeholders with various interests at the beginning was a process that 
needed to be managed carefully until the values were clear.  
Currently, after selecting the community members and defining the programme, 
the communication has become more specific and more focused on general public 
and presenting the developments happening on site. Most of the news items come 
from  the  community  members  themselves. Important  milestones in raising  the 
popularity of the site were the opening of the (still unofficial) swimming area and 
the opening of the Codam school – inaugurated by the Queen of the Netherlands. 
An  important  part  of  the  communication  coming  from  Bureau  Marineterrein  is 
business to business: start-ups, companies, educational institutes, universities 
who could test solutions on site or engage with the community. Another important 
target group is the local neighbourhood:  
“We  organise  regular  meetings  with  the  local  neighbourhood.  And  currently  the  summer 
camp is taking place, for young people from the neighbourhood. These activities are really 
important for showing what we are doing. It costs an incredible amount of money and time, 
but  they  yield  so  much  more. I  believe  so  much  more  in  these kinds of  activities. The

communications so the newspaper and so on, they follow.” – Jacqueline 
Verheugen, communication Bureau Marineterrein. 
When it comes to the general public, many people in Amsterdam do not yet know 
about the area or about the activities happening on site.   
“The  general public  just  really  doesn't  know  anything  about Marineterrein,  some  think  it’s 
still a military area. The message follows after years, this also happened at Westergasfabriek. 
And since we have only been working on it for a few years now, I think that those types of 
processes are always slower than you think.“ –Jacqueline Verheugen, communication Bureau 
Marineterrein.

13 Impact 
Marineterrein is currently in a period where the community has settled in and the 
cross-fertilization in the area is starting to develop more and more, which is giving 
hints  of  the  wider  impact  expected  to  develop  in  the  coming  years  on  the 
neighbourhood and city, and maybe even at the national or international level.  
For Amsterdam, at the moment Marineterrein added an important green and blue 
recreation space, where people can swim or relax, which was missing in the busy

centre area. Moreover, it improved the accessibility in the area by 
adding a boardwalk and a bridge connecting the area to the rest of the city.  
From an innovation perspective, there are many ideas currently being developed, 
tested  or  implemented which  will  influence  the  way  the  area  develops and also 
many future policies for Amsterdam: from blue-green roofs to self-driving boats 
and vehicles. 
“The blue-green roof initiative, that became a big European project. So there are now more 
than a thousand square meters in the city who will get such roofs and which will also measure 
other parameters in turn. The goal is that all the interesting developments from here also go 
to other cities.” – Jacqueline Verheugen, communication Bureau Marineterrein. 
Another  issue  which  will  impact  the  development  and  the  city  is  the  housing 
problem in Amsterdam, which currently adds a lot of pressure to the development. 
How that will take shape in the coming years is not yet known.  
For  the  neighbourhood,  the  impact  is  already  more  important  than  initially 
estimated. While it used to be perceived as one of the poorest and least educated 
neighbourhoods in the centre of Amsterdam, with many young school drop-outs, 
people  in  the  neighbourhood  see  an  important  connection  for  the  future  with 
community members such as Codam, which could offer a second chance for the 
young people with social issues in the neighbourhood.   
 “We always thought it was important [to connect to the neighbourhood], but the national 
government was not too enthusiastic about that. They were thinking about really the highest 
quality  of  innovation  hub, and  3 years  ago  they  did  not  involve  social  exchange  or  social 
return  on  innovation. (...)  But I  think  there  is  much  more  awareness right  now of  the 
importance of being connected. Also, for AMS and for NEMO [community members], it is an 
important  ambition  to not only keep the knowledge at the highest level, but to share and 
involve citizens.” – Liesbeth Jansen, director Bureau Marineterrein.  
Other ideas for a future relationship between Marineterrein and the neighbourhood 
are currently being explored, from a neighbourhood contract to organising a lab 
with free activities for children living nearby.  
A note is to be made about the difference between planned and achieved impact. 
Since the Ministry of Defence decided to remain  on a  larger part  of  the  territory 
than initially foreseen, the project ambitions have to be re-evaluated. Dealing with 
a much smaller terrain is seen as a challenge in achieving the initial impact, and it 
of course depends very much on the way the relationship between the public and 
the military area.  
“I think this counts for all of us... we love this place so much, it’s so amazing to be able to 
work for this, in such a nice place with so much green and so many nice people. Sometimes 
it’s very stressful, because a lot of things are happening at the same time. But I think we all 
do it for a higher purpose, for the social interest. And together with all the people here, also 
in the neighbourhood. We all want it to be a nice place here and not everyone has the same 
idea, but in the end it starts to take shape. If we can leave something behind for the next 
generation,  for  people  who  are  about  to  take  over  again,  that  would  be  beautiful.” –

1 Introduction  
This  paper presents the  redevelopment project of  the Citadel  in Alba  Iulia, 
Romania. The  110-hectare  territory  of  the  Citadel  is  defined  by  an  18
th
-century 
star-shaped  fortification.  However,  the  complex  resulted  from  construction  and 
landscaping activities of almost two thousand years. Starting from around 2000, 
the territory and the buildings were gradually handed over to the city municipality 
by  the  previous  occupant, the Ministry  of  National Defense.  Since  2008, the 
municipality has raised more than 60 million euros for the economic, social, and 
cultural redevelopment of the Citadel. The project is a part of the municipality’s 
strategy to turn Alba Iulia into a city that is attractive for tourists, investors, and 
residents.

Note: This paper contains references to an external document (Appendix 2) with 
the full list of the building in the Citadel in Alba Iulia. It refers to specific 
buildings as “App. 2, No. ...”. 
2 Timeline 
• 1715–1738 – Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban erected the Citadel over the 
remains of the ancient Roman military fort Apulum and the medieval and 
early modern town. 
• 1945–1989 – the territory of the Citadel is used by the army of Communist 
Romania and for official ceremonies; limited access to public; the historical 
building stock is neglected. 
• 2000 – most  of the  fort  is  handed  over  to  the  Alba  Iulia  Municipality; 
beginning of the revitalization project 
• 2007 – Romania  joins  the  European  Union,  access  to  the  Regional 
Operational Program 2007–2013, the beginning of large-scale renovations 
and developments 
• 2008–2011 – restoration works in the area of the gates of the Citadel.

• 2009–2011 – rehabilitation of the  eastern,  southern,  and 
northern side in the Vauban-type fortification. 
• 2010–2013 – rebuilding the western access route to the fortification. 
• 2010–2015 – rehabilitation of the inner area of the Citadel. 
• 2011–2012 – establishment of the “Route of the Three Fortifications” in the 
southeastern section of the Citadel 
• 2014–2015 – creation of the Principia Museum and the Lapidary. 
• 2014–2015 – the establishment  of  a  National  Touristic  Information  and 
Promotion Center in the western part of the fortification. 
• 2016–2020 – the  renovation  of  the  Palace  of  the  Princes  starts,  financed 
from the Regional Operational Program 2014–-2020. 
3 The story 
Though the Citadel forms the center of the city in terms of its spatial development 
and topography, most of it was inaccessible for the public before the Romanian 
revolution in 1989. The former Communist leadership focused on developing the 
surrounding  districts  into  modern  housing  estates.  With  a  few  exceptions,  the 
historical building stock within the Citadel was neglected, left decaying, and several 
buildings were used by the military forces. 
The  situation  was  changed  by  the  emergence  of  modern  democratic  Romania, 
though  the  revitalization  was  a  longer  process.  The  building  stock previously 
handled  by  the  Ministry  of Defense was  transferred  to  the  City  Hall,  the  most 
important parts at the very beginning of 2000. The city management draw up a 
plan for the revitalization of the Citadel and aimed to attract funding from various 
national  and  international  funds.  A  team  was  created  under  the  leadership  of 
Nicolae Moldovan, who was appointed as City Manager responsible for coordinating 
fundraising activities, the city’s international relations, European affairs, as well as 
the relationship with civil society and businesses, including tourism. As he recalls: 
Up to 15 years ago, most of the fortress was a forbidden place for those who live in Alba 
Iulia.  After  the  mayor,  Mr.  Mircea  Hava  was  able  to  convince  the  Ministry  of Defense to 
transfer the property to the city, we started to make plans to change it, to turn it into a vivid 
and attractive place for those living in Alba Iulia and for the tourists, for those coming here 
to learn, to invest, and to have some quality time (Moldovan 2019). 
In  2007,  Romania  joined  the  European Union.  Between  2007  and  2014,  the 
municipality of Alba Iulia was able to attract 60 million euros within the Regional 
Operational   Programme   2007–2013   funded by the   European   Regional 
Development  Fund for  the  restoration  and  revitalization  of  the  Citadel (“Project 
Stories,”   Alba   Iulia). The program   was   mostly   focused on   infrastructure 
development: establishing a new sewage system, public lighting, pedestrian areas, 
parking  lots,  urban  furniture,  touristic  signage,  public  squares,  green  areas. 
Statues,  monuments,  decorative  architecture  were  placed  in  the  public  areas  of 
the Citadel. The gates and the walls of the 18
th
-century fortress were restored; the 
western  part  previously  covered  by  a  park  was  re-opened. The  entrenchments 
between the two ranges of the fortification were organized into a green zone and 
opened for the public.

The major part of construction works was finished by the end of 
2014 – beginning of 2015, but some are still in progress, such as the renovation 
of the Palace of the Princes (App. 2, No. 10). Parallel with the large-scale project 
run by the municipality, other property owners in the Citadel also proceeded with 
the  renovation  of  their  own  buildings:  the  Roman  Catholic  Bishopric (App. 2, 
No. 11-12), the Romanian Orthodox Church (App. 2, No. 15), the Council of Alba 
County (App. 2, No. 2), and the University 1 December 1918 (App. 2, No. 21, 22, 
25, 51).

The municipality had a double aim: to give the Citadel back to the inhabitants of 
Alba Iulia, and, at the same time, to develop it into a touristic destination, thus 
contributing  to  the  economic and  social development  of  the  city – all  these  in 
partnership with the organizations owning or using properties within the Citadel. 
To  achieve  these  goals,  the  city  leadership  also  started  to  develop  a  branding 
strategy in 2010. 
4 Context  
4.1 Demographic context 
The population of Alba Iulia in 2018 numbered 66,369 inhabitants, which makes it 
the 33
rd
 largest city among  the 320  cities  of  Romania.  Its  population has been 
increasing for the  last  15  years,  while  the  national  trend is  population decrease 
(Moldovan 2017, 7; Maican, Muntean, and Pastu 2018, 16).

Figure 3 Population in Alba Iulia 
According  to  the  census in 2011, the population of Alba  Iulia  consists  of  87% 
Romanians, 2% Hungarians, 2%  Roma,  9% undeclared, and other nationalities. 
Two third of Alba Iulia’s residents have at least high-school education: 28% have 
higher  education,  5%  post-secondary  and masters,  30%  high-school,  and  14% 
professional  and  apprentices.  In  2017,  Alba  Iulia  had  7  tertiary  education 
institutions, 4,953 enrolled students, and 156 teaching staff (Strategia Integrată 
2014-2023,  232-235). Compared  with  other  Transylvanian  urban  centers,  Alba 
Iulia has a relatively large share of the population with tertiary education, being 
surpassed only by Cluj-Napoca, the second university center in Romania (Project 
Prioritization 2014-2020, 130). 
In 2016 nearly 47% of Alba Iulia’s population was economically active (compared 
to  the  national  average  of  45,6%),  22%  were  retired, and  7%  officially 
unemployed (Moldovan  2017,  8). Half  of  the  population is  involved  in  economic 
activities,  out  of  which  95%  are  employees, the  rest are  entrepreneurs,  self-
employed or unpaid family workers. Overall, the active population, including both 
employed  and  unemployed  persons,  reached  32.242  people,  representing  51 
percent of the total stable population (Project Prioritization 2014-2020, 125). As 
Table 1 demonstrates, most of the residents work in the tertiary sector.

4.2 Economic background 
Alba County is an average Romanian county from the point of GDP per capita and 
level  of entrepreneurship  development (Project  Prioritization  2014-2020,  122-
123).  Alba  Iulia  benefits  from  a  local  business  class:  small  and  medium-sized

enterprises are  the  basis  of  both the  city’s and  the  county’s 
economy. Most of the employers are micro and small enterprises employing up to 
50  workers.  The  tertiary  sector is  currently  driving  the business  environment  of 
the city, with a share of around 75% of the total number of companies (Project 
Prioritization   2014-2020,   124).   Among   the   most   important   manufacturing 
enterprises  are  Apulum  porcelain  factory  (a  local  supplier  of  IKEA),  VCST 
Automotive  Production  ALBA  specialized  in  metal  processing,  as  well  as  several 
mid-sized textiles, wood, and food processing factories (Project Prioritization 2014-
2020,  135). The  tourism  industry  is  an essential contribution  to  the  economic 
development  of  the  city.  Besides  its  importance  as  a  significant  employer  and 
contribution to the city’s budget, the tourism industry creates demand and growth 
for many other industries. 
Alba Iulia Municipality could obtain more than 150 million euros of European and 
other non-reimbursable funds since 2007. The city has the highest rate among the 
Romanian cities of absorption such funds per capita. The funds were attracted from 
European operative programs, the World Bank, the United Nations Development 
Program (UNDP), the Kingdom of Norway, funds from the Romanian government, 
and other sources (“Start Up Information, Alba Iulia”). However, the leadership of 
Alba  Iulia  wants  to  attract  more financial  and  human  capital  to  the  city. They 
compete in  this  respect  with  the  other  Transylvanian  cities  with  relatively 
developed  business  and  hospitality  infrastructures,  such  as  Cluj-Napoca,  Sibiu, 
Arad, Brașov, and Timișoara. Alba Iulia tries to define and exploit its competitive 
advantage. Among the main challenges is the lack of qualified labor force (due to 
“brain drain”) and of a fair quality of educational services, the socially and poor 
urban  areas, and  the underdeveloped  mobility  infrastructure (Moldovan  2017, 
139-140; Project Prioritization 2014-2020). 
4.3 Cultural and hospitality infrastructure 
The main cultural infrastructure includes (in 2016): a cultural center, two culture 
houses,  an  institution  of  shows  and  concerts,  two  cinemas,  28  libraries, three 
history museums, six local television channels, one newspaper, and six online local 
newspapers, three local radio channels (Strategia Integrată 2014-2023, 239-246).  
As  of  early  October  2019,  Alba  Iulia  offered to its  visitors accommodation in 17 
hotels,  including  four  four-star  hotels  (booking.com).  Airbnb  service  offers  145 
places to stay (airbnb.com). Alba Iulia used to have an image of a small city where 
there is nothing to see, and tourists spent there on average one night. Since the 
beginning of  the  redevelopment  project of  the  Citadel,  which  is  in  the  focus  of 
tourism  development  strategy  of  the  city,  the  average  of  the  nights  spent 
increased to almost three (Maican, Muntean, and Paștiu 2018, 25). According to 
some estimations, the foreign tourists come mostly from Poland, the Republic of 
Moldavia, Italy, Germany, and Hungary (Maican, Muntean, and Paștiu 2018, 26). 
A study conducted at the end of 2013 on the tourists’ profile who chose Alba county 
as a destination demonstrated that more than half of the tourists were searching 
for  a  place  for resting,  recreation, and  relaxation. Tourists who  practice 
mountaineering,  rural  tourism  and  agritourism also  have  a  significant  share, as 
well as those  with other forms of tourism such as visiting relatives  and  friends, 
religious tourism and pilgrimage (Muntean and Moisă 2014, 235).

5 The Alba Iulia Citadel 
5.1 2000 years of reuse 
The Citadel in Alba Iulia is the main attraction as well as the spatial center of the 
modern city. Today it is a district that is surrounded by the 18
th
-century fortification 
walls, but the story goes way back in time.  
The Ancient Roman Apulum 
The  first  urban  settlement  here  was  the  ancient  Roman  Apulum, founded  in  AD 
106. The fort of the Legion XIII Gemina was built on the plateau bordered by the 
River Ampoi in the east and by the River Mureş in the west. It had a rectangular 
ground plan (c. 400 x 400 m) with towers and asymmetrically located gates. In 
the second half of the third century, when the Roman administration and military 
forces  were  withdrawn  from  the  entire  Dacia  province, the  massive  stone 
fortification remained there. It has determined the topography of the settlement 
ever since then. Archaeological excavations carried out since the late 19
th
 century, 
but  especially  after  the  Second  World  War  have  brought  to  surface  numerous 
architectural  and  material  remains.  Many  of  these  are  presented  today  in  the 
Citadel to the broad public and define to a significant extent the image and identity 
of the modern city (see App. 2, No. 4, 6, 7, 18). 
The medieval town 
In  the  centuries  after  the  withdrawal  of  the  Roman  Empire from  Dacia,  various 
peoples  migrated  to  the  region  and  set  up  their  settlements within  the  area 
protected  by  the  walls  of  the  ancient  Roman  fortification.  The  next  phase  of 
constructions that left their long-term marks on the city was carried out after the 
year 1000 when Transylvania was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary, and 
the  Transylvanian  bishopric  was  organized within  the  western  church  hierarchy. 
The bishopric cathedral and the bishop’s residence were built in the southwestern 
corner  of  the  ancient  Roman  fort,  and  they  are  still  among  the  most  important 
landmarks in the city (App. 2, No. 11, 12).  
The capital of the Transylvanian Principality 
When the Ottoman Turkish conquest brought the end of the medieval Hungarian 
Kingdom  in  the  mid-sixteenth  century,  Transylvania was  turned into  a  semi-
independent tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, ruled by a prince, with Alba 
Iulia as its capital. Princes in the 16
th
 and 17
th
 centuries fortified the old walls with 
some  new  bastions.  They  turned  the  medieval  bishop’s  palace  into their 
Renaissance residence (App. 2, No. 10-11). Besides this palace, which is one of 
the  largest  architectural  complexes  in  the  Citadel  today,  one  more  building 
survived from  the  seventeenth  century:  that  of  the Collegium  Academicum,  a 
higher educational institution (App. 2, No. 20). Though the Palace of the Princes 
was handed over to the city by the Ministry of Defense around 2000, the building 
of the Collegium is still a part of the military complex occupying the eastern part 
of the Citadel.

When the united military forces of the European powers pushed 
back  the  Ottomans  from  this  region  in  the late  17
th
 century,  Transylvania  was 
incorporated into the Habsburg Empire, and Alba Iulia was turned into a military 
base. Between 1715 and 1738, a new star-shaped fortification system was built 
around the old town with walls and bastions made of brick and filled up with earth. 
Within  the  fortification,  large  buildings  were  erected  to  house  various  military 
functions which determine the layout of the Citadel today (App. 2, No. 2, 3, 16, 
17, 19). 
Besides  the  army, the  Catholic  Church  also  had  a  share  in  the Citadel. The 
cathedral and the palace were given back to the bishopric. They possessed further 
buildings in the Citadel, for example, a theological seminary was established, and 
the  Jesuit order also  moved back  to  the  town  (App.  2, No.  22).  The  Trinitarian 
order built their church and monastery in the northern part of the Citadel, which 
was taken over by Bishop Ignatius Batthyany later in the 18
th
 century, to house 
his  book  collection  and  an  astronomic  observatory.  The  Batthyaneum, with  its 
precious collection, is one of the most important cultural institutions in Alba Iulia 
even today (App. 2, No. 49).  
The place where Great Romania was born 
The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy (the successor state of the Habsburg Empire since 
1867) was dissolved by the end of the First World War, and Transylvania was taken 
over  by  the  Romanian  military  forces  in  1918.  On  1  December,  the  union  of 
Transylvania  with  Romania  was  proclaimed  in  Alba  Iulia,  in  the  former  Military 
Casino  building,  which  since  1968 – the  150
th
 anniversary – has served as  a 
commemorative exhibition hall to celebrate this event (App. 2, No. 17). The rest 
of the Habsburg military buildings were taken over by the Romanian army (App. 
2, No. 19). Another pivotal event of modern Romanian history took place in the 
Citadel: the coronation of 1922 King Ferdinand I in 1922 in the Orthodox Cathedral 
built for this occasion in the western part of the fortress, dominating the view since 
then from that direction (App. 2, No. 15). 
In Communist Romania 
After  1945,  the  Citadel  remained  a  place  of  symbolic  significance  and  housed 
various official ceremonies in Communist Romania. In 1968, the National Museum 
of the Union and the Union Hall were moved to the former military buildings of the 
Habsburg  era (App.  2,  16,  17).  However,  the  entire  fortress  and  the  buildings 
within were neglected and left to decay, and a large segment of the citadel was 
used  by  the  Ministry  of Defense. After  the  revolution  in  1989,  the  Citadel  was 
gradually  handed  over  to  the  city,  and  the  revitalization  project  started  from 
around 2000. 
5.2 Ownership structure 
The  territory  of  the  Citadel  is  in  mixed  ownership today.  Most  of  it  is  in  public 
hands, owned by the City Municipality, the County Council, and the December 1, 
1918, University. The Roman Catholic Church and the Romanian Orthodox Church 
both own buildings and lands. The Ministry of Defense still has two military units

in  the  Citadel. In  the  northern  part  of  the area,  there  are  also 
some, though very few properties privately owned by residents. 
5.3 The Citadel as a protected heritage site 
The Citadel has been on the Tentative List for UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 
1991. It is one of the easternmost representatives of a series of fortifications built 
in Europe in the 18
th
 century, a type named after Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, 
a  French  military  engineer.  A  group  of  similar  fortifications  in  France has been 
declared as UNESCO World Heritage site (UNESCO, “Fortifications of Vauban”). 
The Alba Iulia Citadel is one of the most strictly protected areas of archaeological 
and built heritage in Romania. Archaeological sites within the entire Citadel of Alba 
Iulia  are  A  category  archaeological  monuments, that is, of national or universal 
value (AB-I-s-A-00001;  AB-I-m-A-00001.01),  the  highest  level  of  protection 
possible  in  Romania. Both  the  ensemble  of  the  fortification  "Alba  Carolina 
Fortress," with all the components: walls, bastions, gates, curtains, ravelins, etc., 
and  entire  urban  area  called “Alba  Iulia  Fortress”  are protected  as  architectural 
monuments in  category  A  (AB-II-a-A-00088). Within  the  Citadel,  there  are  28 
buildings which are protected individually, seven of these as A-category, the rest 
as  B-category  architectural  monuments, that  is,  representatives  for  the  local 
cultural  heritage.  In  addition  to  these,  there  are  three  B-category  public 
monuments  within  the  fortress  (see  also App. 2).  The  General  Urban  Plan 
composed in 2014 by the municipality proposed further four sites for protection 
(App. 2, No. 9, 19, 36, 52; RLU-PUG 2014, 123). 
This protected status had to be taken into consideration during the revitalization: 
archaeological research is required before earthmoving or constructions, and the 
renovation of protected buildings also has to be preceded by research. The Ministry 
of Culture and National Identity issues permits for this research, and their approval 
is also needed to change the function of protected monuments. The City Hall in 
Alba Iulia, as the owner and initiator of the works in the Citadel expressed that 
they  were dedicated  to  acting according  to  the  law.  Still,  they  received  heavy 
criticism from the professional community and the broader public for not dedicating 
enough  time  and  resources  for  the protection  of heritage,  especially  for  the 
research preceding the renovation of urban areas and buildings. As an example, 
in  2011,  when  doing  works  on  the  main  square,  Piaţa  Cetatei,  the  excavations 
were  carried  out  according  to  the  law  by  the  municipal  museum,  but  the  time 
available  was incompatibly  short  considering  the  size  of  the  area  and  the 
complexity of the archaeological site. Marius-Mihai Ciuta, archaeologist and expert 
in the field of protection of the Cultural Heritage observes: 
Alba Iulia is a key to understand many processes and moments in the history of Transylvania 
and not only Transylvania. They did not realize the value of the sites, and the reason was to 
hurry up so as not to lose the EU funds (Ciuta 2019). 
According to the expert opinion, the presentation of the results of the research has 
not been satisfactory either. Ancient Roman stone carvings were displayed in the 
square without any protective roof, and they quickly started to decay. They are 
not interpreted for the public, and the results of the research have not been made 
accessible for the broader academic community either (Ciuta 2019). Another case 
that  appeared to  be problematic  is  the Palace  of  the  Princes, presently  under 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Alba Carolina Citadel 
12 
 
reconstruction. When the municipality expressed its plans about 
this  building  of  immense  historical  and  architectural  value,  the  community  of 
scholarly  experts  approached  the major and  offered  their  cooperation  in  the 
research preceding the works. They set up an interdisciplinary expert team which 
carried out a preliminary survey in the limited time they got and presented their 
results to the city leadership, pointing out that much more time and resources are 
needed  for  the  research  suitable  to  the  character  of  the  monument  before  the 
reconstruction (Burnichioiu 2017). However, these concerns were not fully met ny 
the reconstruction process of the Palace. 
Another problem is already visible for the broader public as well: the use of the 
materials during  the  reconstruction works on  protected  architecture.  The  bricks 
applied on  the  Vauban-type  fortification  proved  to  be  of poor quality  and are 
already decaying. The stone used for paving the street surfaces was also criticized 
since  the  original  stones  were  replaced  with  uniform  but  worse-quality material 
(Ciuta 2019). 
These issues resulted from problems inherent in the Romanian system of heritage 
protection: the organizational system is very much centralized, the regulations are 
strict, but the element of monitoring is not satisfactory, and they are not prepared 
to  handle  locally  specific  situations. As  in  this  case,  it  largely  depends  on  the 
owners of the heritage site how pro-active they are in this respect and to what 
extent they seek and consider experts’ advice. However, there is also a pressure 
coming from the deadlines of EU-funded projects, which might prove more urging 
than the will to make extra efforts to protect heritage. 
6 Urban Development Policy  
In 2009, the Municipality created and Integrated Urban Development Plan for the 
city of Alba Iulia for the period of 2009-2015, a prerequisite of benefitting from 
the  Regional  Operational  Program (ROP) 2007-2013  funded  from  the  European 
Regional Development Fund (PIDU 2009). The PIDU 2009 contained an analysis of 
the entire territory of the Municipality of Alba Iulia in terms of its infrastructure, 
environmental conditions, economy, tourism, society, education, etc. and set up 
objectives,  strategic  priorities,  policies,  programs, and  medium- and  long-term 
development projects. The three strategic objectives were 1) improving the quality 
of life; 2) turning Alba Iulia into an attractive touristic destination; 3) developing 
the business environment. For the period of ROP 2007-2013, seven projects were 
proposed for financing and implementation, and two of these affected the Citadel: 
the  rehabilitation  of  the  public  spaces  within  the  area  inside  the  Vauban-type 
fortification and the reconstruction of the western side of the fortress including the 
access routes. 
As a preparation to benefit from the new Regional Operative Program 2014-2020, 
the City Hall prepared an Integrated Strategy for Urban Development for the period 
of 2014-2023 (Strategia Integrată 2014-2023). The Program aimed at turning Alba 
Iulia by 2023 into an inclusive, open, and smart city (Strategia Integrată 2014-
2023,  316; Project  Prioritization  2014-2020). The  complete  renovation  and 
rehabilitation  of  the  Citadel are among step  towards turning  Alba  Iulia  into  an 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2 
Alba Carolina Citadel 
13 
 
attractive  tourist  destination, which  is one  of  the  three  main 
strategic aims.  The  sustainable  development  of  cultural  tourism  combined  with 
effective city  branding  as  an  area  of  intervention  is  expected  to  contribute  to 
reaching    the    objective    of    sustainable,    smart    growth    and    economic 
competitiveness. Cultural heritage is also seen as a field relevant from the point of 
view of urban regeneration leading to a sustainable,  clean  and  unpolluted  urban 
environment. 
Relevant  projects  planned for  this  period continue  the  reconstruction  campaign 
within  the  Citadel  as  well  as  finding  suitable  functions  for  the  buildings:  the 
caponieri in the Saint Elisabeth and Saint Charles Bastions, and the Trinity Ravelin 
where  they  plan  to  establish  an  open-air amphitheater,  and  the  Palace  of  the 
Princes. The renovation of the latter as well as of the eastern and southern sections 
of the walls is also planned as a priority project (Project Prioritization 2014-2020, 
83-85). They plan to develop the access route to the Apor Palace and the Saint 
Elisabeth  Ravelin  and  to  increase  the  green  zones  within  the  Citadel.  The 
renovation and valorization of the Batthyaneum is an integral part of the project 
package.  They  plan  to  renovate  and  re-valorize the  National  Museum  and  the 
Unification  Hall  and  consolidate  the  complex  of  the  Incoronation  Cathedral. 
Projects with some more general aims target the presentation of archaeological 
sites and the creation of a complete built heritage inventory in the city – it is not 
clear whether they understand only protected monuments here or apply a broader 
definition  of  built  heritage.  A  number  of  projects  do  not  concern  the  physical 
reconstruction  of  the  Citadel  anymore  but its  utilization  primarily  in  the  field  of 
tourism,  e.g. “Ensuring  a  continuous  promotion  of  the  Alba  Iulia  Fortress,  in 
partnership  with  the  economic  agents  from  the  HORECA
1
 sector”;  and  some 
projects concern it indirectly (smart city, tourism strategy, etc.). Other projects 
target the development of a regional network of destinations for heritage tourism. 
The  development  of  the  university  and  the  construction  of  a  new  psychiatric 
hospital  also affects the  function  of  the  buildings  in  the  Citadel,  though  they 
primarily  target  the development  of  educational  and  cultural  infrastructure  to 
achieve the objective of social inclusiveness. Related to the latter, the construction 
of a Cultural Center is planned on the Saint Michael's Bastion, which will contain a 
theatre, the Philharmony, the County Library, and the already existing Museikon 
Museum Complex. 
The strategy does not explicitly consider the role of the Citadel in the identity of 
the  city.  This  approach  seems  to  be  aligned  with  the  national  cultural  heritage 
policy  in  Romania,  where  preservation  has  been  in  focus,  and  the  available 
financial resources were also centered in this direction (Becuţ 2014). However, the 
Citadel  has  been  an essential element in  city  branding  and  marketing (“City 
branding” 2017, Docea, “City logo”, “Good practice summary” 2017). 
CITY BRANDING 
The logo of the city is a representation of the star-shape fortress. The marketing 
strategy is primarily aimed at cultural tourism. They have been developing an 
integrated approach towards city marketing and smart city technologies (“Alba 
Iulia Smart City”). Alba Iulia is positioned in this as ‘The other capital of Romania’ 
                                       
1
 HORECA is a syllabic abbreviation of the words Hotel/Restaurant/Café, e.g. food service industry.

referring to its role in the unification of Romania in 1918, and 
also on its aspiration for a symbolic role, a spiritual capital for the entire country. 
At the same time, the municipality positions the city as a model for small- and 
medium-size towns in Romania and Europe due to the developments in the past 
decade. Alba Iulia was also among the applicants for the title of the European 
Capital of Culture 2021. 
 
The  role  of  the  Citadel  in  the  life  and  formation  of  the  local  community  is  not 
discussed  in  the  strategy  either. Still,  involving  locals  into  the  general  planning 
process is an essential element in the Integrated Strategy for Urban Development 
2014-2023 for  Alba  Iulia:  it presents  in  details  the  participative  process  in  its 
preparation,  and  the  Local  Action  Plan  recognizes that  the  lack  of  feeling  of 
involvement is one of the major problems to handle (Docea, “City logo”). However, 
the  city  management  does not  seem  to  recognize  that treating  the  Citadel  as 
heritage in  the  context  of  the  local  communities  and  not  just  as  a  protected 
national  monument could  be a  key  to  increase  the  level  of  involvement. Some 
actions initiated by the city management show the direction that they recognize 
this potential. For example, in 2009, Alba Iulia entered the Guinness Book with the 
largest human hug in the world, when 10.000 inhabitants embraced the fortress 
for 15 minutes (Moldovan 2019). Though this was a symbolic way to express that 
people should be involved, this was still a top-down initiative. When a group of 
locals  expressed  their  wish  to  be  consulted  by  demonstrating  against  the 
elimination of an old park at the main square of the Citadel, the municipality did 
not follow their request and had the trees cut (Ciuta 2019). 
7 Adaptive Reuse  
The buildings in the Citadel have been continuously used and re-used for centuries. 
However,  the  transfer  of  the  site  from  the  Ministry  of Defense to  the  City  Hall 
created  an  entirely  new  situation,  when  new  function  had  to  be  found  for  the 
buildings in former military use and spaces in the fortification itself. Parallel with 
this, the city leadership has to deal with some other functions inherited from the 
Socialist period, which  do  not  fit  the  new  profile  they  envision  for  the  Citadel, 
focusing on tourism and culture. 
The revitalization of the Citadel and the buildings there are discussed by a series 
of urban planning documents issued from around 2000 (for the complete list, see 
PUZ 2013, 1.1-1.2; RLU-PUG 2014; and the summary in App. 1). These regulated 
all building activity within the Citadel in accordance with its protected status, and 
defined the functions of spaces and buildings. The rehabilitation of the fortification 
zone  followed  the principles established in these  documents. Today the exterior 
side of the wall system – overlooking the surrounding city – is a green area, with 
some  sports establishments  and  a  community  garden  (App.  2, No.  1.10,  1.20-
1.23).  As  a result  of  the  rehabilitation  works  between  2009  and  2014,  now  a 
continuous park belt runs between the two lines of the walls. The rooms within the 
exterior fortification line (former guard rooms and storage spaces) open from this 
park belt; some of these house restaurants, pubs, the Tourist Information Office, 
a cultural center, and an equestrian school, while others are empty. The  rooms

Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2

within  the  inner  fortification  line  are  accessible  from  within  the 
Citadel and are also partially utilized for hospitality purposes. (App. 2, No. 1.11-
1.19) This green belt around the walls is mostly used by tourists and only in nice 
weather. Locals come here if there is some temporary event, festival, which might 
be of special interest to them. 
The interior of the Citadel is structured by a regular street system following the 
former northwest-southeast axis of an ancient Roman fort. There are about sixty 
buildings within the walls, most of them large historical structures built from the 
Middle Ages to the early 20
th
 century, with the exception is two blocks with one-
story urban houses in the northwestern corner also erected from the medieval to 
the modern times. The western side of the Citadel is dominated by the two, Roman 
Catholic and Orthodox cathedral complexes. The Citadel opens up towards the city 
in its main axis, with the Orthodox Cathedral complex, the construction of which 
in  1922  slightly  moved  into  the  background  the  medieval  Roman  Catholic 
Cathedral in terms of the cityscape. The latter forms one spacious complex with 
the medieval and early modern Bishop’s Palace and the Palace of the Princes. The 
area east from the church complexes is occupied by Habsburg military buildings 
and the University, organized around the main square of the Citadel, Piaţa Cetatii. 
The  southeastern  part  is  dominated  by  ancient  Roman  architectural  remains 
excavated  and  presented  to  the  public  (App.  2, No.  4,  6, 7,  18),  and  the  two 
earliest military buildings of the Habsburg era: the former War Commissariat now 
under renovation to be turned into the administrative center of Alba county (App. 
2, No. 2;) and the Warehouse which is now the Hotel Medieval (App. 2, No. 3).  
The  archaeological  remains  of  the  Principia,  the  central  building  of  the  ancient 
Roman  fort were  excavated in Piaţa  Cetatii in  2011.  The  reconstructed remains 
were covered with a metal and glass museum building and opened for the visitors, 
together with  an  open-air  lapidary  occupying  a  part  of  the  square  otherwise 
decorated with 19th-century and modern public monuments (App. 2, No. 16, 56-
59).  The  northern  side  of  the  square  is  dominated  by  the  façade  of  the  main 
building of the December 1, 1918 University which, starting from its establishment 
in 1991, has step by step occupied several large historical buildings in the Citadel, 
such  as the  Baroque  building  of  the  former  Jesuit  monastery, some  recently 
renovated  military  barracks,  and the  former  Baroque  palace  of  the  Apor  family 
(App. 2, No. 21, 22, 25, 51, 52). The latter is flanked by a seventeenth-century 
building  housing  the  School  Inspectorate  of  Alba  County since  2002,  and  the 
eighteenth-century building of the Roman Catholic Theology (App. 2, No. 50, 52). 
The Roman Catholic and the Romanian Orthodox bishopric occupy their historical 
buildings, including the two cathedrals, which dominate the cityscape (App. 2, No. 
11-12, 15). 
At  present,  almost  all  of  the  most  important  cultural  institutions in  the  city – 
museums,  libraries,  the  university – are  clustered  in  the  fortress housed  in 
historical buildings from the Principality and the Habsburg era. Three of these even 
have  a  national  significance. The  Union  Hall, established  in 1968  in the  former 
Casino of the Austro-Hungarian military forces to celebrate the 1918 foundation of 
modern Romania borders the western side of the main square (App. 2, No. 17). 
Behind that, The National Museum of the Union has also occupied since 1968 the 
former military housing called ‘Babylon building’ in the Habsburg era (App. 2, No. 

H2020 PROJECT 
Grant Agreement No 776766 
Deliverable 2.2

16). The northwestern corner of the Citadel is dominated by the 
Biblioteca Batthyaneum in the former Trinitarian church, a function that has  not 
changed since the 18
th
 century (App. 2, No. 49). There is one more relatively large 
complex here: that of the former Military Hospital from the Habsburg era, now the 
Psychiatric Hospital of Alba County inherited from the Socialist era (App.  2, No. 
47). The northernmost building of the complex was transformed into a museum of 
sacred  art  in  Romania called  Museikon and  opened in  2017, but  it  is  accessible 
only through the courtyard of the psychiatry located in the 18
th
-century building 
of the Habsburg military hospital (App. 2, No. 48), which is a disturbing situation 
both for the patients and for the visitors. As outlined in the Integrated Strategy for 
Urban Development 2014-2023, the city management plans to sort out this clash 
of functions in the forthcoming period (Strategia Integrată 2014-2023, 311, 352). 
The other, still problematic area is on the easternmost side of the Citadel, between 
the main square and the fortification, and it is still used by the Ministry of Defense. 
Thus, the former Austro-Hungarian barrack buildings, as well as the building of the 
17
th
-century Collegium Academicum, is closed from the public (App. 2, No. 19-20). 
The city leadership, as well as the residents, seem to agree that the army should 
have no place in the Citadel anymore, and they hope that the negotiations with 
the  Ministry  will  soon  conclude.  However,  it  is  a  task  on  the  long  run  to  find  a 
function to these enormous historical buildings along the lines prescribed by the 
PUG.  
The City Hall has to face the same problem about the Palace of the Princes, a 17
th
-
century building already handed over by the Ministry of Defense. They were able 
to  find  financial  resources  for  the  renovation  of  the  building,  and  the  idea  is  to 
create a modern, interactive museum focusing  mainly  on the  Principality  period 
here (Neag  2017, “Palatul  Principilor” 2019). Nicolae  Moldovan city  manager 
explains: 
The Palace will be a museum but also a vivid space or cultural and educational activities. It 
will not be just a museum, but a space for temporary exhibitions, multimedia halls, with a 
concrete cultural agenda for the entire year (Moldovan 2019). 
Though there was a design competition, and a young architect was selected as the 
winner  with  her  design  of  an  interactive  educational center, the  plans  are  still 
vague, especially  in  terms  of  sustainability. These buildings represent a  typical 
problem the City Hall has to face: their policy is to keep the Citadel for cultural 
and touristic, and in a limited scale administrative functions, but the buildings they 
take  over were  built  for  military  and  state  administration  purposes,  which 
determines their large scale and arrangement. It is especially problematic to fill 
these  buildings  with  life  considering  the  population  number  in  Alba  Iulia.  Hence 
the strategy is to focus on tourism and attract visitors to the Citadel, which might, 
however, easily lead to a situation where the topographic and historical center of 
the city is almost entirely outside the sphere of life of the locals. 
This would  mean  a  failure  in  integrating  the  Citadel  into  the  city  despite  the 
spectacular developments there. It is even more difficult because only a few people 
live  in  the  Citadel.  The  two  northwestern  blocks  of  the  Citadel  are  occupied  by 
small dwelling houses, some of which are used by various foundations and church 
organizations. As Radu Cadinoiu, the president and program manager of the civic 
initiative “Carolina Creative Quarter” pointed out:

... those spaces, even if they are extremely beautiful and can tell a lot 
about our identity and our history, are still preserved as if they were some passive or dead 
monuments. That is not what we would like to have in our Citadel (Cadinoiu 2019/2). 
Despite the emphasis on the touristic potential of the Citadel, the hotel-restaurant-
café industry, which could attract both tourists and the locals, is poorly represented 
inside: the  above-mentioned  Hotel  Medieval in  the  former  Habsburg  military 
warehouse (App. 2, No. 3), a café in the so-called Jericho building (App. 2, No. 9), 
and a small pub mostly visited by locals (App. 2, No. 24). Tourists can mostly feed 
themselves  in  the  mobile  food  wagons  installed  along  the  main  street  of  the 
Citadel. Restaurants  and  cafés  are  in  a  larger  number  in  the  spaces  within  the 
fortification  walls  and  bastions. (App.  2, No.  1.11-1.19).  Some  restaurants 
deliberately build on the atmosphere in the vaulted rooms inside the fortifications. 
The  owner  of Pub13 even decided to brand his restaurant based on the  specific 
heritage site, a 15
th
-century barbican, the history of which is presented to every 
visitor on the paper plate mats (App. 2, No. 1.11; Ciuta 2019). An art café popular 
among locals but also attractive for tourists is accessible from inside the Citadel, 
but technically it is in the fortifications; it is not too easy to find though (App. 2, 
No. 1.17).

Hospitality  and  catering  industry seems to  be  an  answer  for  how  to  use  these 
spaces; on the other hand, these places are not easy to access from inside the 
Citadel  where  tourists  are  expected  for  sightseeing  and  cultural  programs.  This 
might be the reason why there are traces of such places among and in the walls,  
which once operated but are closed down by now. It seems that only those are 
successful which are located close to the main entrances of the fortification system. 
The recently established Tourist Information Office in one of the bastions is also 
difficult to access since it is outside the main tourist route in the Citadel. In general, 
the orientation towards the hospitality business in the Citadel has not been entirely 
successful,  and  there  have  even  been complaining on  behalf  of  the  public  that 
there  are  only profit-oriented enterprises in the Citadel instead of the promised 
cultural and community spaces ("Cetatea Alba Iulia” 2016). Some others see that 
focusing exclusively on the business side is not enough.

Cristian Mladin, the initiator  and  former  vice-president  of  the  Carolina  Creative 
Quarter shares his explanation for the phenomenon: 
The question is why there is still no big interest in the Citadel if you have a restored Citadel, 
nice places where you can eat and drink and have some words with friends or others, still, 
there is a lack of interest. My explanation is that there is a lack of the kind of infrastructure 
that supports creativity and all kinds of activities, non-traditional ones in the cultural and 
economic horizon. (Mladin 2019/2) 
The  city  management  also  identified  the double  problem  after  the  bulk  of  the 
renovation  project: they  have  too  many  empty  spaces  which need a  suitable 
function, and the Citadel is not integrated organically with the rest of the city in 
terms of urban life (Moldovan 2019). They came up with various methods to solve 
these problems. The Citadel houses at least 20 public open-air events per year, 
some  of  them  organized  by  the  municipality  (e.g.  the  Dilema  Veche  Festival,  a 
private  initiative  financed  by  the  Municipality  and  the  Alba  County  Council, 
historical  festivals  focusing  on  the  Ancient  Roman  Period or  the  Middle  Ages, 
concerts) and some by external organizations (e.g. truck art festival, pet shows). 
They  also  seek  to  strengthen  the  public-private  partnership  especially  in  the 
hospitality sector, where tourists are the primary target audience. Developing the 
educational profile of the town is part of the long-term strategy to bring life into 
the Citadel by strengthening the role of the university there. That could also be an 
answer to how to use the remaining military buildings from the Habsburg period.

Culture remains the primary profile in the vision of the City Hall about the Citadel 
(Moldovan 2019). The  Integrated  strategy  2014-2013  also  emphasized  the 
direction to develop the creative and artistic sector by encouraging local creative 
and  cultural  industries  and  attracting  investors  and  involving  valuable  human 
capital  in  the  field,  which  is  seen  closely  interlinked  with  the  conservation  and 
rehabilitation  efforts  on  the  historical  buildings  through  the  capitalization  of  the 
material and immaterial local heritage of the city (Strategia Integrată 2014-2023, 
303). 
The forth direction in which the city leadership started to experiment, though still 
in a relatively small scale, is establishing a partnership with civic organizations in 
the  cultural  and  creative  sector,  such  as  the Theatre  Skepsis  or  the  Alba  Iulia 
Creative  Quarter, and  offering  some  of  the  spaces  for  them  to  use.  The  target 
audience  of  these  organizations  is  the  local  community,  so  their  programs  and 
activities can attract locals into the Citadel. Cristian Mladin acknowledges: 
Until people still think the traditional way about developing a cultural infrastructure at a place 
like Alba Iulia, you have no chance. You have to challenge the residents. It is not enough to 
organize big music festivals in the Citadel on certain days, e.g., the Days of Alba Iulia, all 
financed by the Municipality. (Mladin 2019/1) 
These have been project-based cooperation between the municipality and the civic 
sector, which resulted in the temporary use of certain spaces in the Citadel. The 
city leadership recognized the potential of experimenting with temporary use, and 
between 2013 and 2015, they took part in a program called Temporary Use as a 
Tool  for  Urban  Regeneration financed  by  URBACT scheme  (TUTUR). Within  this 
project, they experimented with the temporary use of various places in the fortress 
for  cultural  activities,  such  as  the backyard of  the  palace  of  the  Princes  before 
starting its restoration. However, these experiments have not been turned into a 
general  practice  yet. The former city  manager of  Alba  Iulia  Nicolae  Moldovan 
explains the limitations:  
To some extent, we are accustomed to this concept [temporary reuse]. We started to use it, 
but it is not so extensively used right now because we lack resources but also because of the 

H2020 PROJECT

mentality. We have to educate, open the mentality towards these new 
concepts in urban regeneration, how to create a vivid city using different arguments with 
different stakeholders. So, we have started, but we still have a lot of steps to follow in this 
field. (Moldovan 2019)  
Such  an  experiment  has  been  the  cooperation  with  the  NGO Carolina  Creative 
Quarter. The NGO was established in 2017 to activate the cultural and creative 
industry in Alba Iulia, and the Citadel plays a crucial role in their vision. As Cristian 
Mladin recalls the circumstances, 
The  municipality  was  just  finishing  the  restoration  of  the  Citadel,  and  the  idea  was  to  do 
something with these spaces, mainly those within the walls of the Citadel..., to activate them 
somehow,  to  bring  people  inside...  Our  main  aim  was  to  activate  the  local  community 
regarding creativity. We saw that creative hubs and other similar institutions was a trend in 
Romania, so we tried to do something similar in Alba Iulia, having this great privilege to be 
in a historical city with a very different type of heritage. (Mladin 2019/2). 
The  current president  and  program  manager of Carolina  Creative  Quarter  Radu 
Cadinoiu dreams about  the Citadel as  a  place  for  the  community  where  civic 
movement and public engagement flourishing: 
Our  obsession  for  the  future  is  to  be  considered  the  home  of  all  the  creatives  of  our 
community who accept us, who are able to do something for the community and who are 
willing to develop a more meaningful approach to the Citadel instead of seeing it as a dead 
monument, going there from time to time to place a flower but without understanding that 
it  is  a  part  of  our  identity.  I  would  like  to  have  a  common  space,  some  kind  of  hub, 
makerspace, offering them all the main facilities they need, and they do need those facilities. 
We would like to be the home for our creatives. We would like to have spaces even if they 
are  not  owned by us as an  NGO but only administered  or  managed,  in  order  to  help  the 
authorities, the municipality, to have a better interaction with the teenagers, meaning the 
next generation. (Cadinoiu 2019/2) 
Already  in  2016,  the founders  of  the  future NGO  brought  together  all  creatives 
from Alba Iulia and organized an exhibition in the Citadel, combining architectural 
plans, design objects, jewelry, works of arts, and many other things. In 2017, they 
won funding for a program from the national program directed by the Ministry of 
Culture called ACCES dedicated to the centenary of 1 December 1918, the 100
th
 
anniversary  of  the  Great  Union  of  the  Romanian  territories. They  developed  an 
urban game combined with urban art using various spaces in the Citadel, the aim 
of which was to bring together the locals and heritage. In 2018, they organized an 
international  event  series  called  Creative  Hubs.  They  collected  people  with 
experience  in  the  field  from  all  over  Europe  to  have  a  brainstorming  on  how  a 
creative hub could be established in Alba Iulia. This was combined with workshops 
for  local  young  people  in  various  creative  fields:  DJ-ing, video and light design, 
cultural  marketing,  modern  design,  and  photography,  which  took  place in  the 
Palace of the Princes and space in the walls called Caponiera in the Citadel. In the 
end, the  results  of  the programs were presented  for  the  broader public  and  the 
city management in the Principia Museum. The Caponiera was renovated by that 
time  by  the  municipality  to  be  used  as  a  community  space  by  various  civic 
organizations.

Though the activists of Creative Quarter Carolina are satisfied with the results of 
these events, and they very much value the supportive attitude and openness of 
the  city  management,  they  urge  for  a  more  intense  cooperation  since  they  feel 
that they could do much more in developing the cultural and creative sector in the 
city, in involving and mobilizing the local community, and in bringing life into the 
empty walls of the Citadel. Radu Cadinoiu emphasizes: 
From  the  very  beginning, we  cannot  imagine  our  activity  without  the  support  of  the 
municipality,  that  is  very  clear.  We  really  appreciate  that  there  is  a  team  who is always 
supporting us... For those two projects we have to thank the municipality; without them the 
project  would  not have  happened... We  would  expect  more  in  terms  of  an  official  policy 
regarding our interests and activities ... We expect that in the next few years they would be 
more open just asking us what we expect to see here, what would be the experience we are 
able to propose for our Citadel, not even only their citadel but our Citadel. (Cadinoiu 2019/2) 
The main issues seen by the activists are the slow rhythm of bureaucracy, the lack 
of inclusion of civic initiatives in terms of mid- and long-term  strategy,  and  the 
fear of giving away a part of the control in the case of such an important national 
monument as the Citadel. They feel that the municipality does not recognize the 
full potential of civic initiatives and temporary reuse, and they too much insist on 
keeping the  control in  the  management  of  the  site (Cadinoiu  2019/1,  2019/2). 
Cristian Mladin thinks that more empowerment could help the decision-makers to 
understand the prospective direction for the site’s development: 
I, as a major or council president, would choose a month, let’s say July or August, to let all 
the spaces in the Citadel occupied by some activity. What is the profile of your NGO? Go

there  and  play  cards  or  have  a  musical  event,  have  some  movie 
projections, whatever. Go wild! Have rock or hip-hop music there; I don’t care, but populate 
that space. Give it a life. Bring people here. If things go well, I will help you from our budget. 
(Mladin 2019/1) 
8 Actors and governance  
The main actor is the municipality of Alba Iulia as the owner of most of the Citadel. 
They  set  up  the  relevant  strategies,  do  the  planning  at  the  level  of  the  Citadel, 
provide access to financial resources, control the partnerships, and dominate the 
public discourse. The Council of Alba County is one of their most important partners 
and  co-owner  of  the  Citadel.  The  two,  Greek  Orthodox  and  Roman  Catholic 
churches  are  responsible  for  the  management  of  their  own  assets  within  the 
Citadel. Their cooperation with the city and each other is reduced to the necessary 
minimum, but the churches have a decisive role in the discourse about the Citadel, 
and there is clear competition for the ownership of the past where heritage serves 
as an argument. Since religion is interlinked with ethnicities, in this case, they also 
represent  two,  Romanian  and  Hungarian  ethnic  groups  in  the  Citadel. The 
University and the Museum are also among the main partners of the municipality 
in  understanding  and  communicating  what  heritage  means  in  the  case  of  the 
Citadel. Nicolae Moldovan, as a representative of the municipality acknowledges 
the importance of contribution of the abovementioned institutes:  
We had a good and strong and active partnership with these organizations. We were working 
together to restore and to valorize our properties and to manage to attract funds. A process 
over 15 years, all those having properties here worked together to change, to open them. 
(Moldovan 2019) 
The private sector in HORECA industry and services is considered as an important 
stakeholder  by  the  city  management. Civic  organizations,  NGOs  have  had  a 
relatively  small  role  by  now, but  there  is  a  segment  in  this  field that urges  for 
deeper  involvement. Both  the  activists  and  the  representative  of  the  city agree 
that  all  this  is  not  enough, partnerships should be broadened and strengthened 
between all actors, and new partnerships should be established (Mladin 2019/2, 
Moldovan 2019). Nicolae  Moldovan indicates  that  the  municipality wishes to 
intensify the partnership:  
Alba Iulia and the fortress needs different institutional partners, some of them are already 
here, others could be attracted in order to help us to promote the potential of the city outside 
its   boundaries.   National   Government, through   the   Ministry   of   Culture,   Ministry   of 
Development, Ministry of Tourism, could be a strong partner for Alba Iulia. Also, international 
tour  operators  could  be  attracted  here  as  stakeholders.  Relevant  transnational  networks 
promoting cultural heritage, such as the Cultural Routes organized by the Council of Europe. 
Also, a network  of universities, cultural  and creative  industry  hubs,  from all  over Europe. 
(Moldovan 2019) 
To  coordinate  all  processed  related  to  the  Citadel, the  municipality  raised  for 
consideration  the  idea  of  creating  a  special organization  called  Citadel  Heritage 
Management (Project Prioritization 2014-2020, 111).

Between 2016 and 2019, the  Alba  Iulia  Smart  City  Pilot  Project  runs  within  the 
European  Innovation  Partnership  on  Smart  Cities  and  Communities (“Alba  Iulia 
Smart  City”).  The  initiative  supported  by  the  European  Commission  bringing 
together cities, industry, SMEs, banks, research, and other smart city actors. The 
outputs of the project are based on partnerships with the private creative sector, 
such as an app to explore the Citadel, wifi hotspots in public areas, an e-Albaiulia 
app  developed  in  partnership  with  Orange.  A  web  application  called  Local 
Community  Barometer  is  in  the  testing  phase  now,  designed  to  consult  city 
residents  on  selecting  community-relevant  objectives  and  projects  proposed  for 
funding or other topics of general interest. 
The municipality experimented with some methods to involve the local public into 
the decision-making processes.  In  2007,  before  starting  the  project,  the  town 
leadership conducted a sociological survey asking people what they wanted them 
to do with the fortress. The results showed that they wanted to see it as a space 
for leisure activities (walking, biking) and cultural events (Moldovan 2019). After 
the project started, the town leadership organized annual surveys together with 
the university to measure the level of satisfaction, four times between 2014 and 
2018 (“Barometrul” 2014, 2015). Participatory processes were also initiated during 
the  preparations  of  the  Integrated  Development  Strategy  2014-2023,  facilitated 
by the inter-community development association Alba Iulia – AIDA. They set up 
an Urban Working Group from local actors from civil society, institutions, private 
investors and in the field of research and development. Public consultations were 
also organized during the preparation of the document (Strategia Integrată 2014-
2023, 444-452). However, some feel that these participatory initiatives were more 
formal and not effective (Ciuta 2019). Despite the attempts by the municipality to 
initiate participative processes and community involvement, the role of the local 
community in general as an actor is undefined and ineffective. Their role is mostly 
to  act  along  the  initiatives  of  the  government,  provide  support, and  to  give 
feedback  in  a  form  also  organized  by  the  city  leadership.  They have acted 
independently in a few isolated cases, such as by demonstrating – unsuccessfully 
– for  keeping  the  old  trees  in  the  Citadel. The  identification  and  inclusion  of 
marginalized  groups  into  decision  making  do  not  appear explicitly in  the 
participatory processes.

9 Financial framework 
The primary financial  resource  for  the  Citadel  project  came  from  the  Regional 
Operational  Program  of  the  EU. Projects  were  submitted  for  international  and 
national funds and in various partnerships: European Commission (Horizon 2020, 
Interreg, European Social Funds), Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Education of 
the national government, Kingdom of Norway, and also private investment. These 
were  complemented  from  local  and  county  budgets (Strategia  Integrată  2014-
2023,   343,   358-359). Totally   more   than   60   million   euros   were   gained, 
implemented in several projects. (Moldovan 2019). From the works done on the 
fortress  in  the  period  of  the  Regional  Operational  Fund  2007-2013,  76%  of  the 
investments  were  funded  from  EU  resources,  9%  from  national  resources,  and 
15%  from  the  local  budget (Project  Prioritization  2014-2020,  22). For  a  list  of 
projects with the amounts of funding, see App. 1. 
Construction works financed by partners in the Citadel include the reconstruction 
of the Union Hall and former War Commissariat buildings (App. 2, No. 17 and 2) 
financed by Alba County. The establishment  of  a  cultural  center  around  the 
Museicon Museum, in the place of the present psychiatric hospital (App. 2, No. 47 
and 48), will  also  be  financed  from  the  county  budget. The  University was also 
able to attract funding from the Regional Operational Program 2014-2020 for its 
buildings (see App. 1). The Romanian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic 
Bishopric funded the renovation of their building complexes, the latter financed by 
the Romanian state, the Hungarian state, the Catholic Church, and from private 
donations. 
The financial sustainability of the Citadel program is embedded into the economy 
of the city and the related strategy, but no detailed plans are openly accessible in 
this respect. In this respect, the main value of the Citadel is defined by the city 
management as its touristic potential.  
10 Communication  
The city leadership has put a great emphasis on the efficient communication of the 
project and city branding in general, which is largely based on the historical past 
and the Citadel as heritage. On the site, billboards were set up about the phases 
of the projects, and a permanent pyramid-shaped public monument was installed 
on  Piaţa  Cetatii  displaying  before-after  images. The city  leadership regularly 
informs the local public on the plans, the attained funding, and the steps in the 
realization  of  the  conservation  and  renovation  project.  They  use  a  variety  of 
communication channels:  the  website  of  the  municipality,  six local  television 
channels, three local radio channels, as well as the local newspaper and six online 
local news sites (Strategia Integrată 2014-2023, 239-246).
 
The municipality also 
has its own Facebook page. They use various events and actions to popularize the 
project, such as two Guinness record attempts initiated by the town leadership to 
create  a  sense  of  pride  among  the  residents.  In  2009,  Alba  Iulia  entered  the 
Guinness  Book  with  the  largest  human hug  in  the  world  around  the  fortress 

H2020 PROJECT

embraced  by  10.000  inhabitants,  and  in  2018,  a  similar  action 
was  organized  on  the  occasion  of  the  100
th
 anniversary  of  modern  Romania 
(Moldovan 2019). 
In 2010, the city started to develop a branding strategy focused on the Citadel in 
the framework of the URBACT project (“City branding” 2017; Docea, “City logo”). 
They  had  a  city  logo designed which consists of four elements: the  star-shaped 
ground plan of the Citadel, the name of the city and the new slogan at the top 
("the  other  capital"),  and a message at  the  bottom  under  the  name  of  the  city 
("welcome  to  the  largest  citadel  in  Romania"). The  site  visitalbaiulia.com  was 
created as part of the branding project. In 2011, the city started the project called 
"Breathe the air of history" financed by the Ministry of Regional Development and 
Tourism.  The  project  aims  to  promote  the  tourism  potential  of  the  Citadel  by 
creating an integrated package of marketing activities (“Referat” 2019).

11 Values and identity  
The  revitalization  project  focuses  on  the  conservation  and  renovation  of  the 
buildings and  their  utilization  to  attract  visitors  to  the  Citadel. The core values 
perceived by the Municipality as manifest in the planning documents is that Alba 
Iulia is a unique city in Romania with the largest fortress in Southeastern Europe. 
The Zonal  Urban  Plan refers  not  just  to  the  fortification  itself  but  also  to  “the 
remarkable  building  stock  of  the  fortress  comprised  of  fortifications,  secular, 
ecclesiastical  and  administrative  buildings.”  (PUZ 2013, 177: Study  of  the 
historical, architectural and urban values) The official communication emphasizes 
that this is also the place where modern Romania was born 100 years ago. The 
strong partnership they were able to establish between different stakeholders and 
work together in order to change the image of the fortress and to create a new 
atmosphere  based  on  the 18
th
-century  one  is  also  a  value that  is emphasized 
(Moldovan 2019). The  branding  strategy  of  the  city  presents  Alba  Iulia  as  a 
modern, fast-developing town which “might be small” but “rock & roll” (“The Other 
Capital”). It is presented as “the other capital” contrasted with Bucharest based 
on its historical significance and heritage, the center of which is the Citadel.

The narrative of the Citadel presented by the city on the site and 
in various media is based on three historical phases: the ancient Roman military 
fort, the Habsburg era, and the creation of the modern Romanian state in 1918. 
The  period  of  the  Transylvanian  Principality  appears  in  the  concept  of  “three 
fortifications,” which would be the Roman castrum, the medieval fortress, and the 
“Alba  Carolina  Citadel”  built  in  the  18
th
 century (App.  2.  No.  7;  “Alba  Iulia 
Fortress.”). Medieval, in  this  case, does  not  include  the  real Middle  Ages  of  the 
town when it was an important regional and ecclesiastical center in the Hungarian 
Kingdom. This   periodization   does   not   correspond   to   the archaeological 
interpretation of the built heritage here, which, before the 18
th
 century, suggests 
more  and  continuous  use  and  reuse  of  the  site  with minor  phases  architectural 
transformations  from  time  to  time (Ciuta 2019,  see  also Rusu  2010). The 
Principality era will receive more emphasis when, according to the plans, the Palace 
of  the  Princes  will  be  turned  into  such  a  thematic  museum. In  the  Principality 
period, Michael the Brave Prince of Walachia and Moldavia had the Transylvanian 
throne  in  Alba  Iulia  as  well  for  a  brief  time,  so  his  rule  is  regarded  as  the 
predecessor of the modern Romanian state, and he himself celebrated as one of 
the  main  national  heroes (See  PUZ 2013, 88-89;  “The  Other  Capital” ). The 
exhibition  in the  National  Museum of  the  Union  is  still  based  on  the  historical 
narrative  of  the  Socialist  era;  the  curators  modernized only  the  ancient  Roman 
section.

Kulikov, 2019. 
Built heritage and history is emphasized in the modern presentation of the Citadel, 
intangible heritage is not explored. The historical narrative focuses on the political 
and ecclesiastical history, while the everyday life of various layers of the population 
hardly appears. The multiethnic and multicultural character specific for Alba Iulia 
since the beginnings is not present. There are minority ethnic groups who once 
lived or still live in the city – Germans, Jews, Hungarians, Roma, etc. – are poorly 
represented in the narrative. The Hungarian minority is kept present in the Citadel 
by the Hungarian Catholic bishopric. The heritage represented by their sites, the

medieval  cathedral, and  the  bishop’s  palace  are  targeted  by 
tourists from Hungary, who, however, do not connect to the narrative presented 
by  the  city. An  archaeologist  and  heritage  expert Marius  Ciuta think that more 
inclusive historical narrative can contribute to heritage value of the Citadel:  
This  is  not  tourism  but a pilgrimage.  There  is  more  here:  many  monasteries,  the 
Batthanyeum, the old streets. The tourists do not know that the streets today are the same 
streets as in the Roman military camp. Nobody knows that medieval streets had names like 
Italian (Olasz), German (Szász), Jewish (Zsidó) Streets. It is beautiful, and you should tell 
them the story of how multicultural was once this city.... If we want to put the Citadel in its 
real value, we need to assume all moments of its history. Not only Roman history, not only 
Austrian history, not only Michael the Brave. The kind of history with big jumps is not a good 
one because frustration will appear on behalf of the minorities. (Ciuta 2019) 
CONTESTED HERITAGE 
There is also a long ongoing contest for the ownership of the past in the fort, 
which is also present in the interpretation of the built heritage. Since ethnicity in 
Transylvania is interwoven not just with language but also with religion, the 
recent archaeological excavation of a 10th century church in the southwestern 
part of the fort has again brought to surface the question of who was first here: 
the western or the eastern church and various historical interpretations connect 
the ruins to various ethnic groups present in the area (Marcu Istrate 2015). 
A research project financed by the Local Council and the City Hall of Alba Iulia in 
2014-2019  and  implemented  by  the  Department  of  History,  Archaeology  and 
Museology of the 1 December 1918 University in cooperation with the Museum of 
the Union presents a different and much more inclusive version of the city’s past. 
The output of the project called Memoria Urbis is a website and a book. Various 
layers of the history, as well as the minority groups, appear in it, though mostly 
related  to  the  districts  surrounding  the  Citadel (Anghel  et  al.  2018;  “Memoria 
Urbis”). These perspectives still need to find their way to the story presented in 
and  about  the  Citadel. Cristian  Mladin is  sure that more  sophisticated  historical 
narrative is important not only due to the public curiosity, but it can also be a part 
of the sustainable approach: 
The  Citadel  in  the  next  10  or  15  years  could  have  or  could  add  other  stories  besides the 
principal story, the historical one. We always see it, that is here, that is a fact. But I think 
we  need  to  add  to  the  Citadel  other  stories,  maybe  unpopular  or  untraditional  stories 
regarding, of course, the civil society, the arts, crafts, and other similar domains. The only 
chance for the Citadel to survive and not in the touristic way. (Mladin 2019/2) 
12 Impact  
The Citadel project, embedded into the context of other EU funded development 
projects in the city, was able to stop the population decrease in Alba Iulia, which 
is  otherwise  the  national  trend. Moreover,  it  attracted  many visitors,  whose 
number  has doubled since 2013. With a population 66,369 residents, Alba Iulia 
welcomes some 400,000 visitors per year, out of whom 14% come from abroad. 
Nicolae Moldovan sees it as a positive trend which has direct impact on the quality 
of life of Alba Iulia residents:

The recent growth of the population shows that we increased the quality 
of  life  here, and  people  moved  here.  There  are  also many foreign, national,  and  private 
investments in Alba Iulia and the surrounding area, which attracted many labor forces here 
who decided to stay here. (Moldovan 2019)

The mayor who lead the entire process was elected and re-elected by the citizens 
of Alba Iulia six times, which, as the city management interpreted it, indicates that 
most people were satisfied with the results (Moldovan 2019). The results of the 
surveys also indicate general satisfaction despite the occasional criticism. 
The Alba Iulia's success was also recognized on the national and EU level. In 2012, 
Alba Iulia was chosen as one of Romania's Destinations of Excellence under the 
EU's  EDEN  tourism  project. The  European  Commission  launched  the  EDEN 
Destinations of Excellence project in 2006 aimed to promote sustainable tourism 
and  unknown  or  underdeveloped  areas. Romania’s  Ministry  of  Communication 
chose Alba Iulia in 2016 to be the first smart city in Romania because it is one of 
the first cities to have a long-term development strategy, launched in 2002-2003 
and implemented since then. It is also the city that attracted the highest rate of 
EU funds and started to develop a smart transport system (Vasilache 2016). This 
award brought  to  the  city prominent technology companies,  such  as  Siemens, 
Microsoft, Google and Orange (Moldovan 2019). 
13 The model  
• The municipality is the primary owner, decision-maker, and investor. 
• A high level of protection of the entire site and buildings as monuments at 
the national level. 
• Substantial limitations concerning the functions of the building defined by 
the local municipality: public and cultural functions, tourism. 
• Emphasis  on  tourism  and  creative  industries  as  a  leveler to  revitalize  the 
city. Orientation  towards  modern  technologies,  interest  in  using  big  data, 
flirting with the concept of urban digitalization, presenting itself as “smart 
city”. 
• Project-based  long-term  developments  along with a  mid-term  strategy. 
Building  new  projects  on  the  previous  successful  ones,  e.g., building  a 
branding strategy on the city logo project.

• Financed mostly from  EU  funds. A  desire  to increase  the 
share  of the private  financing which  is  low  compared  to  the  public 
investments. 
• Top-down model, strong administrative  and  political  leadership  for  a long 
period. 
• Increasing  the  level  of  citizen  participation,  but the  potential  is  still  high. 
The stakeholders believe that inclusiveness should be increased. Controlled 
participation, a fair level of public empowerment. 
14 Recommendation 
In addition to moving public institutions into the buildings, community initiatives 
for the temporary reuse of various parts of the sites could be actively encouraged 
by  the  municipality – it  would  increase  the  attractiveness  and  the  value  of  the 
place (Plevoets and Sowińska-Heim 2018). In general, this is  understood in  the 
context of elevating underdeveloped parts of the cities to generate a process of 
physical restoration, but in this case the method could be adapted to bring life into 
a  highly  protected  and  recently  renovated  district.  The  presence  of  the  local 
communities would increase the touristic attractiveness of the Citadel since this 
would mean a shift from looking at heritage as a “thing to conserve and protect” 
to “heritage as a process,” an active creation of heritage, in a broader sense than 
just presenting historical monuments. To reach its vision and have a livable urban 
space which economically contributes to the city, the municipality should give up 
the control of defining the heritage values, and instead, open up the field for value 
creation  for  various,  even  marginalized  groups  by  inviting  them  and  offering 
partnership.  Thus,  they  would  be  involved  in  the  creation  of  the  new  Citadel 
understood  as  a  functional  site  and  become a part  of  its  story  (Plevoets and 
Sowińska-Heim 2018, 137).

Summary    of    revitalization    plans    in    the 
documents PUZ 2013: 1.1-1.2 and RLU-PUG 2014 
The most important urban planning document explicitly dealing with the Citadel is 
the  Zonal  Urban  Plan and  the  related Local  Norms  of Urbanism created in  2013 
(PUZ  2013).  According  to  Law  350/2001  on  spatial  and  urban  planning,  the 
relevant PUZ must be aligned with the General Urban Plan, which is mandatory to 
create for all administrative units in Romania. In Alba Iulia, the revision of the PUG 
from 1996 went parallel with the elaboration of the PUZ, and it was accepted in 
2014  (RLU-PUG  2014).  Parallel  with  these,  several  Detailed  Urban  Plans  were 
created  from  2015  for  various  parts  of  the  Citadel, which  regulated  specific 
construction activities in detail (for the complete list, see PUZ 2013, 1.1-1.2). 
The RLU-PUG 2014 introduced a new zoning system in the city which was based 
on four factors: 1) the functions permitted in the zone; 2) the mode of construction 
(continuous, discontinuous, etc.), 3) the height of the buildings, and 4) the level 
of historical or natural protection. The Citadel located in the Central Protected zone 
was covered by two sub-zones: CP1 (the territory surrounded by the 18th-century 
fortifications)  and  CP2  (the  zone  of  the  fortifications),  both  protected  historical 
monuments  in  the  highest,  A  category.  The  RLU-PUG  2014  prescribed  the 
conditions of any developments within this area. 
The RLU-PUG 2014 defined which functions are permitted for the buildings in the 
Citadel: only representative public functions, administrative functions, museums, 
libraries,    cultural    centers,    educational    and    cultural    functions,    student 
accommodation and  other  functions  related  to  the  university  campus,  galleries, 
shops  selling  religious  objects,  antiques,  art,  books,  handicraft  products,  public 
catering and accommodation for tourists, fine art workshops, and organized and 
planted public spaces. For the zone of the fortifications, the following functions are 
permitted: planted public spaces, also with some specific uses, such as outdoor 
exhibitions,  botanic  gardens,  landscape  models;  spaces  for  sport  and  cultural 
activities,  information  services,  public sanitary  facilities,  arts,  medieval  crafts, 
exhibitions,  shops,  public  catering  such  as  clubs,  pubs,  confectioneries,  bars, 
seasonal terraces, as well as travel agencies and guide services. The operation of 
the  kindergarten  or  the  already  existing  healthcare  services  are  permitted 
conditionally, until their relocation. Outdoor activities are allowed in the zone of 
the fortifications in case they do not disturb the neighboring functions and do not 
damage  the  vegetation.  There  is  also  a  list  of  prohibited  functions,  which  is 
especially restrictive in the case of the fortification zone: everything is prohibited 
which is not connected to leisure or tourism.
