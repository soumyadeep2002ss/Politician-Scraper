Towards Inquiry-Based Learning in Spatial Development and Heritage Conservation: A Workshop at Corviale, Rome
Giovanni Caudo

Sustainability

Situated local knowledge and co-evolutionary processes overtake certitude and formal planning, challenging the way (cultural) heritage is produced in terms of both space and knowledge. This article contributes to the debate surrounding planning education and research by exploring the potential of inquiry-based learning (IBL) in spatial development and heritage conservation. The main argument is that the IBL format presented herein enables interaction and cooperation between various groups and their diverse sets of knowledge. To that end, the IBL approach was implemented both through project work and by creating a specific learning environment encompassing theory, exhibition, places, and people, and in which a research process was realised by students through iteration and reflection. The contribution systematises the results of a 2021 workshop held in Venice and Rome, including at the Corviale housing complex (Rome). In seeking to respond to the title-theme of the Venice Biennale, H...

Learning from Modern Heritage: Methodological Tools for Re-thinking Education in Conservation

Andrea Canziani, Andrea Luciani, Margherita Pedroni

The paper is based on experience developed in several years of teaching conservation of modern heritage in schools of architecture, international Erasmus workshops and doco- momo workshops to students coming from all over the world, with different cultural and educational backgrounds. Modern architectural heritage masterpieces have a high potential for pedagogic purposes, especially in helping students to develop a critical thinking on (modern) heritage preservation. During these courses students are guided through an in-depth analysis of a speci c building, or buildings, in order to de ne intervention strategies and to develop a preservation project. The analysis of the buildings – ranging from historical understanding of the radical ideas of modern architects to eld survey, archival and bibliographical research, and analysis of uses, problems, materials and decay – is the starting point of a continuous challenge to common- place, standard solutions, to established beliefs about the modern heritage and about the contemporary role of the architect. All this is made possible through the application of a teaching method within which the theory of conservation and practice of design proceed at the same pace, in a spiral process of mutual awareness. This method is the most appropriate to engage students with preser- vation and reuse of modern architecture, meant as essential tools for their future profes- sional background, rather than as separate elds of action. The project is a mean to pinpoint the subtle contradictions of the discipline and an occasion to develop the required critical knowledge to translate theoretical positions in a sound approach to the transformation/ evolution of built heritage.

City Walls as Historic Urban Landscape: a Case Study on Participatory Education

2017 •

Margherita Cisani

The concept of Historic Urban Landscape, which now guides the conservation and promotion of numerous heritage sites across the world, is based on the recognition of the complexity of the urban environment, seen as a dynamic system of cultural and natural features. This paper aims at presenting an ongoing reassessment of the meaning of a historic artefact in the city of Bergamo, Italy, which is part of a broader system of defence built by the Venetian Republic between the 15th and 17th centuries. Among the many related initiatives, one was launched by the University of Bergamo and involved nearly a hundred primary school children in a series of multidisciplinary workshops. Children worked to produce a guidebook and a short animated film aimed at reconstructing the meanings and the values embodied by the Venetian Walls, an enduring cultural icon surrounding the medieval upper town. This project is triggering both downscaling and upscaling dynamics in the regeneration process of this historic urban infrastructure. It also contributes to the creation and sharing of new meanings around this heritage, which are strongly related to its value for the citizenship as well as for the visitors.

In this article, written within the framework of the European Curbatheri-Deep Cities project, we explain our thoughts on new ways of approaching the conservation of urban heritage in the cities of Barcelona (Sant Andreu) and London (Woolwich). Although special emphasis has been placed on historical methods to describe, interpret and evaluate the urban heritage defined by historical transformations, less attention has been paid to the way in which the knowledge and uses contributed by society can be integrated. In this sense, the use of different ethnographic methodologies as an instrument for fostering dialogue between stakeholders.

Reflecting on the Legacy of Kevin Lynch's Cognitive Approach to City Design through Italian Didactic Experiences

2018 •

Journal of Civil Engineering and Architecture DPC

In Italy, the writings of Kevin Lynch (1918-1984) have had great influence. However, if The Image of the City (1960, trans. 1964) enjoyed a prolonged success, other texts attracted a fluctuating attention. The reasons for this variable interest help reflect on the current usability of Lynch's lesson: the relevance given to social perception; the need to give voice to citizens' needs; a performance approach to the project as a participatory process. The ability to stimulate a reflective attitude explains why, in Italy, Lynch's legacy has found its major expression in teaching. Recent experiences at the Universities of Rome and Trieste-also suggested by the Lynch's centennial-show how his texts still constitute a reference to approach urban analysis and design, being completely involved in the physical perception of the places and listening to the inhabitants' stories. Didactic activities highlight further exploitation of Lynch's theory in terms of: the importance of learning by interaction; a better understanding of urban space and social practices; the drawing of projects from mental maps. Nonetheless, when working in the historical parts of Italian cities, the character and uses of urban spaces urge us to adjust Lynch's categories, thus, in fact, confirming their critical capacity and timeliness.

Planning and heritage

2013 •

Luca Zan

Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to introduce the papers selected for the present special issue on planning and heritage. This paper aims at advancing knowledge about the variety of uses and meanings of planning tools and practices in the cultural heritage field, by bridging disciplines and by building on evidence from the studies composing the special issue. Design/methodology/approach – After a review of the debate on planning in management studies, the paper briefly outlines the features of the five selected papers and it reconstructs a composite narrative on planning in cultural heritage, as it emerges from the collected papers taken together. Findings – In the fields of both management and urban studies a similar trajectory of “rise and fall” of rationalistic views of planning has taken place. Today&#39;s discourse of planning in urban studies is strongly dominated by the issue of inclusiveness and participation. When looking at “who” really participates in these processe...

Interacting future visions and decisions in World Heritage management and spatial planning: a case study of the Antonine Wall World Heritage

Interacting future visions and decisions in World Heritage management and spatial planning: a case study of the Antonine Wall World Heritage

2020 •

Roland Láposi

Through the case study of Antonine Wall, this Covid-19 adjusted exploratory research attempts to draw light upon how interacting future visions in world heritage management and local level spatial planning influence each other and the development decisions in planning and heritage. The main goal was to understand ‘how’ and ‘why’ interactions between different actors and stakeholders shape the scene. By using the perspectives of a heritage student, a community member and a planner, it went beyond the rhetoric of strategies, policies and guidelines. For politicians, World Heritage may mainly mean economic success, for planners it is about the act of balancing competing interests in the built and natural environment, while for the public it is about connecting to their heritage and gaining benefits for the society. For the coordinators of World Heritage sites, the main objective is the effective protection ‘for present and future generations’ (UNESCO, 2019b, paragraph 109.). Within World Heritage, there are large, complex serial transnational designations such as the Frontiers of the Roman Empire, which are representing unique cases as their elements stretch over long distances, cross over local administrative boundaries, touch many different landscapes and distinctive built up areas, belonging to multiple communities and operating within various legal frameworks. The research explored the stakeholder ecology of the Antonine Wall in Scotland, to understand the relationships and connections shaping the future visions. It found that trust and cooperation; meaning, awareness and engagement; OUV and place identity as well as benefits, drives and funding are the key themes influencing most the fate of the Antonine Wall WHS. Review of relevant literature showed how the process of giving meaning to a heritage place works through memory and heritage, identity construction, place and belonging and leads to ownership. It revealed that giving meaning lays foundation to narratives, that connects to people. The qualitative research included interviews with stakeholders about their experiences, motivations and considerations in heritage development decisions and a non-participant, ethnographic observation to capture what users experienced at the Antonine Wall posted on YouTube. The research outlines recommendations for nominated FRE sites and identifies potential areas of further research.
