ABSTRACT 
This thesis argues for the significance of castellated civic palaces in shaping and consolidating 
Florence’s  territorial  hegemony  during  the  fifteenth  century.  Although  fortress-like  civic 
palaces were a predominant architectural type in Tuscan communes from the twelfth century 
onwards, it is an understudied field. In the literature of Italian Renaissance civic and military 
architecture, the castellated motifs of civic palaces have either been marginalised as an outdated 
and anti-classical form opposing Quattrocento all’antica taste, or have been oversimplified as 
a  redundant  object  lacking  defensive  functionality.  By  analysing  Michelozzo’s  Palazzo 
Comunale  in  Montepulciano,  a  fifteenth-century  castellated  palace  resembling  Florence’s 
thirteenth-century Palazzo dei Priori, this thesis seeks to address the ways in which castellated 
forms substantially legitimised Florence’s political, military and cultural supremacy.  
Chapter One examines textual  and pictorial representations of Florence’s castellation  civic 
palaces  and fortifications  in  order  to  capture  Florentine  perceptions  of  castellation.  This 
investigation offers a conceptual framework, interpreting the profile of castellated civic palaces 
as an effective architectural affirmation of the contemporary idea of a powerful city-republic 
rather than being a symbol of despotism as it has been previously understood. Chapters Two 
and Three examine Montepulciano’s renovation project for the Palazzo Comunale within local 
and  central  administrative,  socio-political,  and  military  contexts  during  the  first  half  of  the 
fifteenth century, highlighting the Florentine features of Montepulciano’s town hall despite the 
town’s peripheral  location  within  the  Florentine  dominion.  Chapter  Four  casts  light  on  the 
effective  agency  of  Michelozzo’s castellated design in facilitating an architectural dialogue 
between  civic  and  military,  medieval  and  Renaissance,  classical  and  modern,  and  centre and 
periphery, enhancing civic coherence in the town, as well as across the whole Florentine state.

By looking  at  Michelozzo’s  mid-fifteenth  century  design,  this  thesis  demonstrates  the 
interdependence of communal palaces’ castellated forms and their civic functions.
