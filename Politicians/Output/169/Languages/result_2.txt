Constitutional provisions relating to Eighth Schedule 
 
The  Constitutional  provisions  relating  to  the  Eighth  Schedule  occur  in 
article 344(1)  and  351  of  the  Constitution.  Article  344(1)  provides  for  the 
constitution of a Commission by the President on expiration of five years from the 
commencement  of  the  Constitution  and  thereafter  at  the  expiration  of  ten  years 
from such  commencement,  which  shall  consist  of  a  Chairman  and  such  other 
members representing the different languages specified in the Eighth Schedule to 
make recommendations to the President for the progressive use of Hindi for official 
purposes of the Union. Article 351 of the Constitution provides that it shall be the 
duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language to develop it so that 
it may  serve  as  a  medium  of  expression  for  all  the  elements  of  the  composite 
culture  of India  and  to  secure  its  enrichment  by  assimilating  without  interfering 
with  its  genius, the  forms,  style  and  expressions  used  in  Hindustani  and  in  the 
other  languages  of India  specified  in  the  Eighth  Schedule,  and  by  drawing, 
wherever  necessary  or desirable,  for  its  vocabulary,  primarily,  on  Sanskrit  and 
secondarily  on  other languages.  It  would  thus  appear  that  the  Eighth  Schedule 
was intended to promote the progressive use of Hindi and for the enrichment and 
promotion of that language.

Present status on inclusion of languages in the Eighth Schedule 
 
“As the evolution of dialects and languages is dynamic, influenced by socio-
eco-political developments, it is difficult to fix any criterion for languages, whether 
to  distinguish them  from  dialects,  or  for  inclusion  in  the  Eighth  Schedule  to  the 
Constitution  of  India.  Thus,  both  attempts,  through  the  Pahwa  (1996)  and 
Sitakant  Mohapatra  (2003)  Committees  to  evolve  such  fixed  criteria  have  not 
borne fruit. The Government is conscious of the sentiments and requirements for 
inclusion of other languages in the Eighth Schedule and will examine the requests 
keeping in mind these sentiments, and other considerations such as evolution of 
dialects into language, widespread use of a language etc.”
