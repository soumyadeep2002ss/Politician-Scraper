History[edit]

Aizawl Theological College was started by Rev. D.E. Jones, popularly known as Pu Zosaphluia among the Mizos, in 1907 as a humble theological school to train native Christians for various ministries of the church. It was originally named "Aijal Theological School". In 1924, the theological school was shifted from Aizawl to Durtlang at the present site of the Presbyterian Hospital. Rev. F.J. Sandy managed the administration. But Sandy unexpectedly died and the school was moved back to Aizawl proper and headed by Rev. E.L. Mendus. The school was closed in 1937 affected by circumstances of the Second World War. It was revived in 1951 to become a proper theological college. Rev. J.M. Lloyd became the first designated Principal and the college was located at Mission Vengthlang, Aizawl. The Senate of Serampore College granted affiliation to the college at the level of Licentiate in Theology (L.Th.) in 1965. The college was then officially named "Aizawl Theological College." When Rev. J.M. Lloyd returned to Wales he was succeeded by Rev. C. Pazawna who became the first Mizo Principal of the College. He remained in office for seventeen years. In 1971, the College was upgraded to the B. Th. level by the Senate of Serampore College, replacing the L. Th. diploma course programme. In 1994 that the Senate of Serampore College allowed Aizawl Theological College to start the B.D. programme. In June 1998 the Council for Academic Affairs of the Senate of Serampore College granted Aizawl Theological College the status of a full-fledged B.D. College. The Master of Theology (M.Th) programme in Christian Theology had been introduced since 2002 and M.Th. (New Testament and Missiology) and Doctor of Ministry (D.Min) respectively are also being introduced from 2007 academic session.[3]
