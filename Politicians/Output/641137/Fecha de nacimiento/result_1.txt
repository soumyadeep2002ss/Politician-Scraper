Montxo Armendariz (born as Juan Ramón Armendariz Barrios; 27 January 1949 in Olleta, Navarra, Spain)[1] is a Spanish film director and screenwriter. His film Las cartas de Alou won at the San Sebastian Film Festival. His next film, Historias del Kronen, was entered into the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.[2] Secretos del corazón won several Goya Awards, the Blue Angel Award at the Berlin Film Festival[3] and received the Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film.

Early life and work[edit]

Born on 27 January 1949 in Olleta, Navarra.[4] He was the last hope for his parents, who had already lost three baby sons.[5] His father was a farmhand and blacksmith and Armendáriz spent his first year in rural Basque Country, a landscape that would reappear repeatedly in his filmography.[5] He was six years old when, in 1955, he moved with his parents to Pamplona in search of a better life.[5] At age eighteen, he discovered existentialism in the works of foreign authors. After completing his mandatory military service, he studied electronics, a subject he taught as university professor at the Instituto politecnico de Pamplona.[6] Interested in filmmaking, he joined a film club, studied folklore, wrote and performed protest songs and bought a Super 8 camera to make his own short films. In 1975 he was arrested for protesting the killing of a Basque activist and faced trial on charges of conspiracy; this coincided with Franco's death and a subsequent amnesty was declared.[7]

Eventually Armendáriz left his teaching profession behind to follow a career as film director.[8] He joined Euskal Zinegille Elkartea, a new association of Basque filmmakers and made a series of documentary shorts on Basque topics including: Barregarriaren Dantza (Funny Dance) (1979) and Ikusmena (Landscape) (1980).[8]

Ikusmena presents a ten-year-old girl winning a prize in a school painting competition in a narrative disruptive by flashbacks that reveal how her artistic creativity had already been stifled by censorship and social pressures. Ikusmena was a success at festivals, but it suffered the inevitability limited distribution of short films.[7] Armendáriz turned towards the more socially relevant documentary genre and made the eleventh episode in the Ikuska series: La ribera de Navarra (The Riberbanks of Navarre) ( 1981). This he followed with Nafarrako Ikazkinack in 1981 (The Charcoal workers of Navarre), a portrait of the hard life of charcoal burners. It was while making this project that the director met Tasio Ochoa, who inspired his first feature-length film.[7]

Feature films[edit]

Tasio (1984), Armendáriz's debut as full-length feature film director, traces the generational history of the title character, a charcoal burner in the Urbasa mountains, whose threaten way of life is detail in a series of elliptical sequences in a visual style that approximates ethnographic cinema. Produced by Elias Querejeta, who also worked on the screenplay, Tasio is played by three actors at different ages. Tasio's realism demanded a three months shoot that involved the actors living and working in primitive conditions.[9] Tasio won critical praise and placed Armendáriz as an emerging talented director to be considered.
