20this reason, when studying medieval law, it is necessary to refer to the local charters reference letter .

In the case of the Iberian Peninsula, there was an important factor to take into account, which did not occur in other parts of Europe: the Reconquest. The disappearance of the Visigothic kingdom and the emergence of the new political centres that were formed as it progressed, determined the emergence of a new law, of course inspired by traditional law, already known and practised, but also with its own elements, differential to each place or human group .

One of the three political nuclei that emerged on the Iberian Peninsula after the Reconquest, together with the kingdom of Asturias and the Catalan counties, was precisely the kingdom of Pamplona. For this reason, it is possible to refer to reference letter as Navarre's own right from the moment it was constituted as a distinct political entity, first called the Kingdom of Pamplona and, from 1162, the Kingdom of Navarre.

Since its emergence as a kingdom, Navarre has gone through four stages in its constitutional history, in the sense that its political structure or status has changed over time.

These four stages are as follows:

Navarre, independent kingdom (905-1512)

Navarre, a separate kingdom within the Crown of Castile (1515-1841)

Navarre, from kingdom to province (1841-1978)

Navarra, Comunidad Foral ( 1978-present)
