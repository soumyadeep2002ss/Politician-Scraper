MEMBER PARTIES AND MEMBERSHIP

IDLO is composed of 38 Member Parties. As a treaty-based organization, membership in IDLO can be achieved through accession to the Establishment Agreement. The first step to initiate the membership process is for a country or organization to convey to IDLO Headquarters in Rome an expression of interest in becoming a member, through a formal statement addressed to the President of the Assembly of Parties. The expression of interest is then submitted to the Assembly for approval by simple majority. 

Following approval by the Assembly of Parties and upon completion of the relevant domestic legal process for accession to an international treaty, the Country concerned deposits the instrument of accession to the Italian Foreign Ministry as the official depository of IDLO’s Establishment Agreement. Membership becomes effective upon the deposit of the instrument of accession.

Membership enables a party to participate in IDLO’s governing bodies and decision-making, and provide leadership in shaping the strategic direction, policies and operational priorities of the organization. IDLO members can count on a unique network of in-country and international rule of law experts, participate in the international policy debate on emerging trends in the rule of law and share best practices and expertise to address common challenges.

The procedure to become a Member Party of IDLO is outlined here.

For more information about the membership process, please contact the Secretariat: secretariat[at]idlo.int.
