It was an honor and a pleasure to speak at the panel on International Crimes Across an Emerging Accountability Ecosystem during the conference Stand Tall for the Rule of Law, co-organized by the American Society of International Law and the Ukrainian International Law Association in the beautiful city of Lviv this weekend. Reaffirming the importance of international law and the commitment to stand by those who suffer as a result of its flagrant violation was a fitting way to mark the 75th anniversary of both the Genocide Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
