Expert Explains: How the Northeast was ‚Äòinvented‚Äô, 52 years ago
The North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act and the North-Eastern Council Act were enacted by Parliament on December 30, 1971. Together, they gave birth to Northeast India as an officially recognised and named entity that we know today.

The Northeast was 'invented' via a series of ad hoc decisions aimed at governing the erstwhile frontier region. (Ministry of Home Affairs)

On December 30, 1971, two laws ‚Äî the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act and the North-Eastern Council Act ‚Äî were enacted by Parliament.

With these, Northeast India ‚Äúemerged as a significant administrative concept replacing the hitherto more familiar unit of public imagination, Assam,‚Äù B P Singh, a former senior bureaucrat who served as the Governor of Sikkim from 2008-13, wrote in The Problem of Change: A Study of North-East India (1997).

Today, ‚ÄòNortheast India‚Äô, or just ‚Äòthe Northeast‚Äô, is commonly used by Indians to refer to the diverse region, with its inhabitants becoming ‚ÄòNortheasterners‚Äô, regardless of how they themselves self-identify. Yet the term took root only in the 1970s.

Here is the story of the ‚Äòinvention‚Äô of Northeast India.

The Northeast

Northeast India officially comprises eights states ‚Äî Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura ‚Äî which are a part of the North-Eastern Council, a statutory advisory body that plays a role in development planning, and region-level policy making.

Pre-Independence, five of these eight present-day states (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Mizoram) were a part of colonial Assam. Manipur and Tripura were princely states, with resident British political officers answering to the governor of Assam.

Sikkim, the most unique of the eight, was juridically independent but under British paramountcy. It became an independent country in 1947, before being annexed by India in 1975. In 2001 Sikkim was made a member of the North Eastern Council, and thus officially a part of the Northeast.

Part of the colonial ‚Äúfrontier‚Äù

Colonial Assam was a ‚Äúfrontier province‚Äù in British India. Like the North West Frontier Province (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in present-day Pakistan), the political legal setup in the province was very different from the rest of the country.

Direct rule was limited to territories behind the administrative border, known as the ‚Äòsettled districts‚Äô of Assam (most of present-day Assam and Sylhet, now in Bangladesh). These densely populated districts were ‚Äî and still are ‚Äî the region‚Äôs economic heartland, with thriving tea, cOAL%2C%20and%20Oil%20INDUSTRIES%20MERGING 20In%20THE%20NinEEETETH%20CENTURY.%0a%0ABEYOND%20Theese%20districts%20Lay%20The%20So-Callled%20%E2%80%98Excluded%20AREAS%E2%8% 0 99%202%20The%20%e2%80%98hill%20AREAS%E2%80%99%2C%20Controlled%20BY%20various%20TRIBES%2c 20Withs 20MINIMALAS 20presense%20Oof%20The%20colonial%20state%. 20These%20AREAS%20Were%20 (and%20still%20RE%2C%20RATIVELY%20Speaking) 20Sparsley 20POPOPULATED%2c 20A%20provided%20A%20Buffer%20Zone%20Between%20The%20%E2%80%98Sttl ED%20districts %E2%80%99%20and%20The%20internoteal%20border.%0%0afor%20instance%2c%20Like%20The%20FEDERLLY%20ADININIDIDIDISID%20TRIBAL%20AREA%20 (Fata)%20LOCATED%20BETWEEN%20The%20%E2 80%98SettLed%20Districts%E2%80%99%20OF%20The%20NWFP%20and%20The%20internoteal 20Border%20with%20AFGHANISTAN%2C%20The%20NONTH 20EAST 20EAST 20FRORTIRER%20TRACTRATRACTRACTRACTRATRACTSS 20%20 (Modern-Day% 20Arunachal 20pradesh 20AD%20A%20part%20NAGALAND) 20was%20carved 20%20in%201914%2c 20SSAM%2C%20AD%20The%20internoteal%20Border%20with%20TIBET%20and%20Burma.

Moreover, Northeasterners have long complained of being subjected to racial slurs based on phenotypic stereotypes. Many find themselves non-recognized and misrecognized, hailing from places such as China, Nepal, Thailand, or Japan, or as ‚Äòlesser Indians‚Äô rather than as equal citizens.

Since the new governance structure and its naming were the result of a process of muddling through ‚Äî and not much thought was given to its possible consequences ‚Äî it was perhaps inevitable that it would create as many new problems as it would solve.
