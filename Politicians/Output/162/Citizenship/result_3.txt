Yes, a Pakistani can marry and settle in India, but it is not a straightforward process.

Is it OK for a Pakistani to settle in India for a job?

It is ok for a citizens of Pakistan to work and settle in India as long as they condemn the terror attacks perpeterated by their country in India and pay their taxes. Otherwise, it is advised that they find some other country. India will not tolerate their hypocrisy anymore.
