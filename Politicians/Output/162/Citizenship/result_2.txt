However, things have changed now. If you want to settle in a country other than yours, you are required to get citizenship, which is quite a complicated and time-consuming process.

But there are some countries offering easy-to-apply citizenship to Indian nationals. So, if you are planning to settle abroad and wondering which is the easiest country to get citizenship for Indians, we have got you covered.

Read on to find out a list of beautiful countries that are offering easy permanent residency and citizenship for Indians.

Top Countries Offering Permanent Residence and Citizenship for Indians

Following are the top easy citizenship countries for Indians:

Dominican Republic

To begin with, one of the countries that offers the easiest citizenship for Indians is the Dominican Republic. It is a popular Caribbean country known for its serene beaches, luxury resorts, and laid-back lifestyle.

Coming to the best part, this nation has very straightforward citizenship requirements. You just need to live two years in the country as a PR to be eligible for citizenship.

Note that to become a permanent resident in DR, you must have a minimum income of $2,000 USD per month. Further, if you are married to a citizen of the Dominican Republic, you can apply for citizenship right after six months of living together.

Talking about the citizenship process, the applicants need to go through a medical examination, a Spanish language test, and a final interview.

Peru

Peru is another country where you can get citizenship after living in it for two continuous years. It is an ancient and culturally rich South American country known for its awe-inspiring beauty. The process begins with acquiring a residency visa, which gets approved in just three months.

Once approved, you get six months to finalise your visit. After completing two years in the country as a permanent resident, you become eligible for citizenship application.

Further, the process includes passing multiple tests on the culture and history of Peru along with clearing a mandatory Spanish language test.

Talking about the citizenship cost, it is typically around $25,000 USD, which can be paid in instalments.

Ireland

Ireland is named as the easiest country to get PR for Indians. It is among the highly sought-after destinations for work, study, and permanent settlement.

Macedonia

Macedonia is a European country best known for its natural beauty. Indians can get Macedonian citizenship very quickly.

All you need to do is start a business in the country and employ at least 10 people; this is enough to show your purpose to settle in the country.

Ecuador

Situated on the west coast of South America, Ecuador is named among the countries offering citizenship for free. It is a developed country that holds great growth potential and a thriving tourism sector.

Indians can get citizenship in this country through an investment programme that requires them to invest $25,000 USD in a Certificate of Deposit (CD) offered by a financial institution in Ecuador.

Apart from this requirement, you need to stay for at least three years before applying for citizenship. Here comes the most highlighting part — you can travel visa-free to over 80 countries with an Ecuadorian passport. This includes Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America.

Antigua and Barbuda

The list of free citizenship countries is incomplete without a special mention of Antigua and Barbuda — a beautiful island country in the Caribbean. It is notably one of the richest Caribbean countries.

Similar to Ecuador, you can get citizenship in A&B through an investment program. You need to invest about $4,00,000 USD in real estate to be eligible for citizenship.
