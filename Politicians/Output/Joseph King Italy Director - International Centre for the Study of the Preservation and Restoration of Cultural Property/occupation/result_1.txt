Enhancing Our Heritage Toolkit 2.0
UNESCO and the Advisory Bodies to the World Heritage Committee - ICCROM, ICOMOS and IUCN - have released a newly revised toolkit for assessing the effectiveness of management systems of World Heritage properties. Enhancing Our Heritage Toolkit 2.0 offers a World Heritage-specific methodology of management effectiveness assessment that can be applied to cultural, natural and mixed sites.  
	
Guidance and Toolkit for Impact Assessment in a World Heritage Context
The Guidance and Toolkit for Impact Assessments in a World Heritage Context is the go-to reference that explains the process for achieving these goals. Offering practical tips and tools including checklists and a glossary, it provides a framework for conducting impact assessments for cultural and natural heritage sites.
Anticipating Futures for Heritage
In July 2021, as part of its Foresight Initiative, ICCROM launched a horizon scan study to gather intelligence about possible macro-environmental changes that might affect cultural heritage in the future. To undertake this work, the project engaged an interdisciplinary team of 18 researchers and two advisors from different world regions who collectively generated over 60 research reports looking out over a 15-year horizon. The study intends to serve as a starting point for an ongoing foresight process to inform the development of ICCROM’s longer-term strategy, and particularly its strategic orientations for the next planning cycle (2026–2031).
