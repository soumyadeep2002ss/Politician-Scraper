The historical University of Alcalá (1499-1836) received numerous reformers who changed its internal regulations and organization over the course of four centuries.[7] A reformation ordered by Philip IV was carried out at the University of Alcalá de Henares.

The overseer and reformer for this task was Doctor Don Garcia de Medrano, a member of His Majesty's council and chamber, and of the Supreme Council and General Inquisition. Medrano was tasked with executing the reformation and fulfilling the visitation in the year 1665, with the implementation being carried out in the subsequent year, 1666.

For at least about 160 years, many members in the House of Medrano were linked to the University of Salamanca: in 1508, Don Luis de Medrano was the rector and his sister Luisa de Medrano was the first female professor at the University of Salamanca and potentially all of Europe.[14] The next generation of the Medrano family also produced two rectors at the University of Salamanca: Domingo and García de Medrano y Mendizábal, both fourth nephews of Luisa de Medrano and knights of the Order of Calatrava. The Book of the university's Claustro for the year 1668-1669 describes Domingo's abdication and García's election for the rest of the year very clearly. The Book of the university's Claustro of 1668-1669 indicates that Domingo de Medrano, due to urgent business in Madrid, was forced to resign, and was succeeded by García de Medrano y Mendizábal, undoubtedly his brother. The younger sons of this family were also there, studying scholarship, while the eldest son, Andrés, Count of Torrubia, held the title of Lord of San Gregorio.[15]
