ECMWF

European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts

ECMWF headquarters

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is an independent intergovernmental organisation supported by 23 European Member States and 11 Co-operating States with its headquarters in Reading, United Kingdom.

Established in 1975, the ECMWF is renowned worldwide for providing the most accurate medium-range global weather forecasts (up to 10 days ahead), monthly forecasts and seasonal outlooks (up to six months ahead). Its products are provided to the European national meteorological services and complement national short-range as well as climate-related activities.


A high-performance computer (HPC) system is linked by high-speed telecommunication lines to the computer systems of the national meteorological services of the organisation's Member and Co-operating States. On its HPC, the ECMWF holds the world's largest archive of numerical weather prediction data as the basis for the world's most sophisticated medium-range global atmosphere and ocean forecasting model. The ECMWF provides most advanced data assimilation systems and global models for the dynamics, thermodynamics and composition of the Earth's fluid envelope and the interacting parts of the earth system, all run on one of the world’s most powerful computer systems. A selection of particularly useful products of the ECMWF forecasting system is made available to all meteorological services worldwide via the WMO's Global Telecommunications System.

The ECMWF offers an extensive education and training programme to assist its Member and Co-operating States with the training of scientists in numerical weather forecasting and on how to use the ECMWF's computer facilities.

Additional premises of ECMWF
In June 2017 it was decided to build a new ECWMF data centre in Bologna. It will open in 2021 and become fully operational in 2022.

On 9th December 2020 the ECMWF Council has decided that Bonn, Germany will be the new location for the European authority with about 150 employees from 2021. From the new location, the tasks related to the EU earth observation pro-gramme “Copernicus” and, in the future, the DEU (Destination Earth) digital strategy are to be implemented. These are vital programmes for the observation of and adaptation to climate change that Germany comprehensively supports both with expertise and funds also at the national level.
