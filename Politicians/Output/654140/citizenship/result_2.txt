Introduction

A Police Clearance Certificate also known as Criminal Record Check in Italy, is issued by the Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) in Italy. In Italy, a centralized database of criminal record information is maintained at the Criminal Records Bureau. PCC certifies that the applicant has never taken part in any criminal activity that led to the involvement of the CRB in Italy and is also required when you apply for immigration, work, or study purposes to other countries.

You are required to state the period of stay in Italy, provide documentary proof of stay, the first entry and last exit date stamp, and all pages of the visa (color copy). It is issued to any individual who resides in Italy for more than six months.




How to Obtain a Police Clearance Certificate from Italy?

You are required to submit a completed application form with all sections duly filled in block letters using black ink; original signatures scanned or facsimile signatures will not be accepted; and a set of 10 fingerprint impressions taken by a qualified fingerprint officer at our lab. After all the formalities are completed, the processing starts. The current processing time is 3 to 4 weeks for PCC.

The certificates will be posted to the forwarding address as indicated by you in the application form. You may apply in writing to the Procura della Repubblica only. The nearest Italian consulate or embassy does not issue a police clearance certificate for Italy. The application has to be sent in hard copy to Rome.
