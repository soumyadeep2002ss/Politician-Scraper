Introduction

The Constitution of India does not allow holding Indian citizenship and citizenship of a foreign country simultaneously. Based on the recommendation of the High Level committee on Indian Diaspora, the Government of India decided to grant Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) commonly known as "dual citizenship". Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) of certain category as has been specified in the column "eligibility criteria" who migrated from India and acquired citizenship of a foreign country other than Pakistan and Bangladesh, are eligible for grant of OCI as long as their home countries allow dual citizenship in some form or the other under their local laws.

Eligibility criteria

A foreign national, who was eligible to become citizen of India on 26.01.1950 or was a citizen of India on or at anytime after 26.01.1950 or belonged to a territory that became part of India after 15.08.1947 and his/her children and grand children, provided his/her country of citizenship allows dual citizenship in some form or other under the local laws, is eligible for registration as Overseas Citizen of India (OCI). Minor children of such person are also eligible for OCI. However, if the applicant had ever been a citizen of Pakistan or Bangladesh, he/she will not be eligible for OCI.

What benefits accrue to an OCI card holder?

Registered OCIs shall be entitled to following benefits:

Multiple entry, multi-purpose life long visa to visit India;
Exemption from reporting to Police authorities for any length of stay in India; and
Parity with NRIs in financial, economic and educational fields except in the acquisition of agricultural or plantation properties.

Persons registered as OCI have not been given any voting rights, election to Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha/Legislative Assembly/Council, holding Constitutional posts such as President, Vice President, Judge of Supreme Court/High Court etc. 
Any further benefits to OCIs will be notified by the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA) under section 7B(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955. 
A person registered as OCI is eligible to apply for grant of Indian citizenship under section 5(1)(g) of the Citizenship Act, 1955 if he/she is registered as OCI for five years and has been residing in India for one year out of the five years before making the application.

Where to apply for the OCI Card?

To the Indian Mission/Post in the country where the applicant is ordinarily resident. 
If the applicant is not living in the country of his/her citizenship, to the Indian Mission/Post having jurisdiction over the country of which the applicant is ordinarily resident. 
If in India on long term visa (more than one year), to the FRRO, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkatta, Amritsar, Chennai or the Joint Secretary (Foreigners), Ministry of Home Affairs.

What is the validity of the OCI Card?

An OCI Card is a life time document. It allows multiple entry multi-purpose life long visa for visiting India.

Procedure for granting registration

The Indian Mission will register a person as OCI within 2 days of the receipt of application and the case shall be referred to the concerned authorities in India for preparation of OCI Card. The whole process takes six weeks approximately.
