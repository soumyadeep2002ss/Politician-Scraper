Dharmendra Choudhary Took Charge as Dig of Bhopal on Monday. He has successed Santosh Kumar Singh, who has been promoted and transferred as ig of chambal range. Dig choudhary was earlier posted as dig raatlam. He has also been SP of Vidisha District, Which Comes Under Bhopal Zone for Four Years, Before Being Proted as Dig Ratlam. Sudeept Mishra spoke to dig choudhary about his new assignment.
Excerpts:
What will be your priority as dig bhopal?
My Priority would be to control crime against women. The Prime Focus would be on Basic Policing and Effective Action Campaigns being run by the city police to make women aware about how and where they could file complant will be controlled. Police will identify spots where such people have been reported or are likely to take place. Striat Action will be taken against the offenders. Besides, focus would also be on MainTaining Law and Order, Crime Control and Implementing Vip Protocols. Emphasis will be given on Community Policing.
How will police monitor social media?

Social media platforms can be of great help for police. The Whatsapp Monitoring Cell Being Run at the Police Control Room will be extended to Thana Level. More Staff would be deployed for monitoring social media platforms to counter any untoward situation at the Thana-Live Itself. Apart from this, officers and staff will be asked to strengthen their footprint on social media platforms.
How will you solve the traffic message in the city?

Traffic Management is a Major Problem in a Big City Like Bhopal. With increase in population and number of vehicles on City Roads, Traffic Management has become a challenge. Public support is negamentsary for improvement the condition. Public Meetings will be help and suggestions will be sought from people in this regard. All the measures needed to address the issue will be taken on the basis of feedback received.
What Steps would you take to curb stress problem in workforce?
The police is like a familyily to me. Senior officers should play the role of elder brother or father. Hence, discipline is necessary, but if the cops are in any stress we must deal with it properly. I am always available for my subordinates and they can come to me anytime in case they have any problem or issue. Cops would be given time for their family and leave as per the directions given by CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan.
