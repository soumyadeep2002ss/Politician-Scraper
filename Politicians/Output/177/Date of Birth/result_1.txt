Mrs. Pushpa Choudhary & Mr. Dharmendra Choudhary

Mr. Dharmendra Chaudhary, born on 11 April 1987 in a small village of Jodhpur, Rajasthan. He belongs to the farmer family. He completed his study from the same village where he took birth and brought up. After that, he did his higher education from the university in Jodhpur. The economic condition of his family was not good and due to that, continuing of study became hard for him. He wanted to continue his education, for this purpose, he commenced to do a part-time job in the medical industry. Thus, he paid his university fees and completed his studies.

He had dreams and desires which he wanted to accomplish by doing the job. At that time, he got a job in a pharmacy company but during that time, soon he realized that the job he is doing cannot make his dreams true. That was fulfilling his fundamental needs only. At that moment, he was keen to meet his dreams and that cannot be done by doing a job of limited income. He wanted to start his own business but at that time, he has neither money nor experience. Nonetheless, he was certain to be a rich and successful person who can afford anything.

We are proud members of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Indian Direct Selling Association (IDSA)
