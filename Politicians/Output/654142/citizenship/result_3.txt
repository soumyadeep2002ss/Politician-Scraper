It was an honour to meet the Minister of Public Administration, Paolo Zangrillo, in the Marengo Auditorium. 

I thank the Minister for his speech on the importance of the Public Administration, because the #efficiency of a country depends as well on the efficiency of the Public Administration. 

Minister Zangrillo discussed the national recovery and resilience plan, focusing on the importance of skills and #human #resources in the implementation of the #PNRR, which is a major challenge. 

The minister's focus on the importance of #investing in #skills and #human #resources is fundamental and essential to ensure the success and effectiveness of any economic recovery and development plan.

I thank all the speakers and the President of the Piedmont Region, Alberto Cirio:

I express my sincere gratitude and honor for meeting with the Albanian Ambassador to Abu Dhabi H.E. Ridi Kurtezi.

Your cordial welcome was the perfect setting for a collaboration to promote #Albania internationally, an endeavor I am enthusiastically pursuing after signing with Laura Plaku, Director of AIDA - Albanian Investment Development Agency. 

I appreciate your leadership and dedication to this cause and look forward to developing a successful collaboration based on the topics discussed with the hope of achieving significant results together. 

I look forward to materializing the commitment made into concrete actions, and I am proud to make my contribution to the development of Albania internationally, a country that has always been a close friend of Italy.
