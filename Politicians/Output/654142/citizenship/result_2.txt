The future is now, and giving it shape and meaning is a priority. This is the proposition on which the 14th edition of Brera Design Week is structured, scheduled from April 17th to April 23rd with over 240 events scheduled. This edition officially marks the event's complete return to a live in-person event. Promoting the theme proposed by Fuorisalone, “Future Lab”, Brera Design Week 2023 stimulates thought on the challenges of contemporaneity, giving space to projects and practices capable of triggering positive change. The future is not something abstract and intangible, rather it is built with the quality of our present.
Brera Design Week 2023 will be a lens on the topical issues that most interest the design industry, from material innovation to circular economy, passing through new market challenges between online and offline experiences, with a focus on fresh ways of involving and capturing the interest of the new generations
“The events and installations of the Brera Design District contribute to enriching the schedule of the Milan Design Week, which takes place from April 17th to April 23rd. This is an important appointment for professionals, but also for simple design lovers: an initiative that introduces the world of design to the whole city, bringing citizens closer to the beauty, the genius, and the culture of design. Design is not only a pillar of our Made in Italy, but it is a fundamental sector thanks to which our city is recognised all over the world, capable of generating new ideas, employment and development of the territory. With the initiatives of the Brera Design District, one of the most important districts of the Milan Design Week, we enhance Italian know-how and creativity, sustainability and circular economy" says Alessia Cappello, Councillor for Labour and Economic Development responsible also for the Fashion and Design sector.
