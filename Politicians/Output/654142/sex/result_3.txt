The most anticipated edition of Fuorisalone at Milan Design Week will be back to play a leading role on the international design scene with events, exhibitions and installations that will photograph the future through the lens of the present. Backing its foundation from the 2022’s edition, the event themes sustainability as its larger focus. The design fair will be on ground from April 17, 2023 to April 23, 2023. With the idea of translating the present and imagining the future and focusing on the themes of circular economy, reuse, sustainability, Fuorisalone will be held in conjunction with the Salone del Mobile.Milano. For the 12th consecutive year, Hyundai Italia will be the main sponsor of Fuorisalone, 2023.

"Fuorisalone is not only a reference point for a sector of excellence that represents the quality of Made in Italy in the world, but also a great opportunity for Milan. Installations, exhibitions, and events spread throughout the city will rekindle the streets, districts, and neighbourhoods of the city, confirming its role as the capital of design and enhancing its image on an international level. I am certain that this edition of Fuorisalone will also be a not-to-be missed event,” says Alessia Cappello, Assessor for Labour and Economic Development with responsibility for Fashion and Design of the Municipality of Milan.

This 2023 edition of Fuorisalone will be offering a stage for debate, to imagine and build alternative ideas through moments of collective dialogue with a theme entitled ‘Laboratorio Futuro.’ It will highlight the themes of sustainable design, circular economy, innovative materials, urban regeneration and artificial intelligence. “The Fuorisalone represents an opportunity for networking and sharing, a collective lab of experiences. This is the inspiration for this year's theme: by lab we mean an active space where knowledge is shared. It is essential to unite skills in order to lay the foundations for a better future,” says Paolo Casati, co-founder and creative director of Studiolabo.

Making its second edition, the leading manufacturer of multimedia installations and interactive experiences, STARK will be dedicating an interactive project of Trame to the theme of the design event. By means of an interactive sound and visual installation, the project will invite us to rely on holistic understanding making us realise how actions are intertwined with those of others. On the other hand the Fuorisalone Award will also make its second edition acknowledging the most celebrated projects at the Milan Design Week. The selected projects will compete for four special mentions in the categories: interaction, sustainability, technology and communication. “Once again this year, the Fuorisalone Award confirms its mission to identify the most relevant projects for the design world. In addition, the new Special Mention by Salone Del Mobile.Milano demonstrates the will to create a system and enhance the city of Milan, a reference point for the furniture and design sector,” says Cristian Confalonieri, founder of Studiolabo.

In the previews of the design districts the Tortona District will present a communication proposal which aims at bringing together and narrating the different realities. It will reflect the current issues seen through the lens of design, with the aim of responding to the challenges of tomorrow. Milano Durini Design will propose the fil rouge “Urban Metamorphosis”, among installations with a strong evocative character that extends to all the valuable companies present in the city centre. 5VIE will be presenting a proposal with the theme “Design for Good” having an intent to create and cultivate deep human connections through design. Isola Design District with the seventh edition of Isola Design Festival including six group exhibitions will be focusing on themes such as circular and regenerative furniture, collectible design and new craftsmanship, design tech and wellness. Amongst the various projects that are running in sync with the theme of Fuorisalone, let's look at some of them in detail.

Padiglione Visconti on Via Tortona will host the brand's exhibition with iconic products that shaped each decade of the brand’s history. Similar to its events last year, which encouraged the evolution of relationships between people and their homes, the 2023 edition will also showcase new products with its research on life at home captured through the lens of photography. Fuorisalone with its theme of ‘Laboratorio Futuro’ not only awakens the art enthusiasts, designers, artists, brands and galleries to think about the future while having a vision of the present but also invites them to reflect on the changes occurring today that could lead towards a sustainable tomorrow.
