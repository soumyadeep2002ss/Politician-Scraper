Congratulations to our new graduates! 

Our 82 military and civilian members of Senior Course 143 successfully completed the NDC Flagship course. 🎓 💪

In the words of the Commandant of the NATO Defense College, Lieutenant General Max A.L.T. Nielsen: "You have displayed a passion for learning; a commitment to strategic thinking; and the cultivation of a risk-informed mindset. Your collaborative efforts, attention to detail, and consensus-building skills set a high standard for effective leadership." 🤝

Our Course Members are now ready to face the challenges that will arise during their future NATO and national positions.

After an inspiring address by our guest speaker, the Ambassador of France in Italy, H.E. Mr Martin Briens, Course Members received their diplomas.

We are proud to contribute to the effectiveness and cohesion of the Alliance by preparing future leaders. 🌐

Congratulations to our newly minted NDC Anciens! 🎉

This week marked an exciting collaboration as we hosted 5 Fellows from the George C. Marshall Center European Center for Security Studies at the NATO Defense College (NDC). 🤝

The visit was an opportunity to foster stronger ties between the two institutions. The visiting Fellows engaged in enriching discussions with the NDC Dean, Dr Chris Schnaubelt, exploring their research topics, focused on political and military strategic challenges. 🗣️💡

But that's not all – they also had the chance to connect with the bright minds of Senior Course 143, shedding light on the academic activities of the NATO Defense College and its pivotal role in preparing our future senior leaders. 🎓🌍

Here is to fostering knowledge, building connections, and advancing shared goals! 🚀

As the NATO Defense College, we take immense pride in the accomplishments of Senior Course 143. 
Today, we're thrilled to announce the successful presentation of their Committee Study Projects. 

These projects are the result of months of group discussions and dedicated teamwork among Course Members, divided in Committees comprising different nationalities.

❔ What is a Committee Study Project “CSP”?
A CSP consists in developing a consensus paper that answers a research question on topics of strategic relevance to NATO, as proposed by the NDC Research Division. Some examples are NATO and strategic competition, crisis prevention & management, and cooperative security, as well as innovation and the future of warfare.

🔎 The primary gains of this exercise include putting into practice strategic thinking skills when choosing a relevant research question, and developing consensus-building techniques to developing an answer.

The best project is awarded the “#Eisenhower Prize”, which will be announced upon graduation of Senior Course 143. Join us in celebrating the hard work and dedication of our graduates. Stay tuned in the coming days as we share more in-depth insights!

Defence Attachés’ Day at the NDC

Today, the NATO Defense College welcomed Defence Attachés from the embassies of NATO Allies and #Sweden in Rome. This served as a valuable opportunity to introduce them to the NDC's activities and to demonstrate how these efforts underpin the College's fundamental mission of enhancing Alliance cohesion through senior education and engagement.

🤝 Defence Attachés’ Day is a unique occasion, contributing to maintaining strong ties with our stakeholders. Together, we strengthen the bonds that fortify our collective commitment to peace and security.
