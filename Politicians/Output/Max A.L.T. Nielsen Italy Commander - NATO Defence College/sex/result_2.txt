Security of Western Balkans is key for both NATO and üá∑üá∏ Serbia. Senior Course 143 visited Belgrade as the last stop of their Field Study journey. A chance to gain a deeper understanding of this Western Balkan Partner. ¬† The stop in Serbia marked the final chapter of the Field Study programme for SC 143, which offered in-depth insights on the defence stances of various Allies and a partner. This experience shed light on each of their significant contributions to fortifying the Alliance's security. https://lnkd.in/ewD2rk9H #Education #Engagement #WeAreNATO

"Who controls the past controls the future", wrote George Orwell, in his dystopian novel, "1984", that portrays a totalitarian society where personal freedom is non-existent. Have a close look at this analysis, and take a renewed look around in the current security landscape. https://lnkd.in/gq8JeW69
