The President of the 🇨🇿 Czech Republic, H.E. Mr Petr Pavel, addressed the Senior Course and NATO Ambassadors from NATO and selected partners at the NATO Defense College. Understanding the positions of NATO Allies is key for NATO and the NATO Defense College. This occasion was a remarkable opportunity to learn more about and discuss Czechia’s security strategy and the importance of collective security. https://lnkd.in/dt-6yUfR #Education #WeAreNATO

Security of Western Balkans is key for both NATO and 🇷🇸 Serbia. Senior Course 143 visited Belgrade as the last stop of their Field Study journey. A chance to gain a deeper understanding of this Western Balkan Partner.   The stop in Serbia marked the final chapter of the Field Study programme for SC 143, which offered in-depth insights on the defence stances of various Allies and a partner. This experience shed light on each of their significant contributions to fortifying the Alliance's security. https://lnkd.in/ewD2rk9H #Education #Engagement #WeAreNATO

"Who controls the past controls the future", wrote George Orwell, in his dystopian novel, "1984", that portrays a totalitarian society where personal freedom is non-existent. Have a close look at this analysis, and take a renewed look around in the current security landscape. https://lnkd.in/gq8JeW69
