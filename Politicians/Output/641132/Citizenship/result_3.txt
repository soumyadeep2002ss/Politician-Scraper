A second lesson is how liability and duty can activate an institution and squeeze staff capacity and hunger for innovation, implementing new facilities with demanding timing and objectives. This backup countercyclical potential reinforces the relevance of having a solid, active and innovative NPB (national promotional bank) that is ready to step in. For the recovery phase, after creating leverage with working capital liquidity, NPBs might play an important role in the need to capitalise that many companies will have, fostering the private equity markets in specific high potential sectors. Furthermore, future finance should focus on long term investments, increasing productivity and efficiency while deepening the Green Deal, addressing new projects and investments as a part of a new economy under sustainable principles.
