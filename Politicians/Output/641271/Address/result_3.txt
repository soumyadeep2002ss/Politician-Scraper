OFFICIAL REQUEST FROM THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA TO JOIN THE IOC 
MADRID /On 15 March 2022, the Executive Director of the IOC welcomed H.E. Azzam Abdulkarim Al Qaim, 
the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Spain, who came to officially deliver the Kingdom’s ap‐
plication to join the IOC.
The Executive Director congratulated his guest for the initiative taken by his government and assured him 
of the full support of the Executive Secretariat in his administrative efforts to finalise the Kingdom’s 
membership.
The Ambassador said he was proud to see his 
country join the IOC family, especially as the olive 
tree has a privileged place in Arab-Muslim culture 
and has an almost sacred meaning. He then asked 
about the next steps, since his government would 
like to become a member before the November 
2022 session.
The Executive Director and the Head of the Legal 
Affairs Department outlined the technical details 
and the steps to be taken and undertook to assist 
the Saudi party if necessary.
At the end of the meeting, the ED gave a tour of the 
headquarters and souvenir photos were taken to 
commemorate the event.
