THE IOC AND GEORGIA: A TEAM EFFORT
 BRUSSELS  / Six minutes well spent and worth listening to in full. Janusz Wojciechowski, European Com-
missioner for Agriculture, gave a speech during World Olive Day celebrations in Tblisi, Georgia, on 26 No-
vember 2021. He outlined the key objectives for the European and global olive sector: market stabilisation, 
more  transparent  rules,  a  global  vision  and  sharing  standards  to  bolster  quality,  facilitate  work  and  help  
markets grow.
‘A    symbolic    product    in    many    
countries  for  historical,  cultural  
and  economic  reasons,  olive  oil  
has  a  prominent  position  in  the  
European  Union’s  agricultural 
policies. We are firm supporters 
of the work of the Executive Sec-
retariat,’ says Commissioner Wo-
jciechowski.  ‘We  firmly  believe 
that    this    cooperation    should    
continue to bear fruit for the sec-
tor and for the people who derive 
their  livelihood  and  wealth  from  
olive growing.’
‘For this reason, the EU’s New Deal, represented by Next Generation EU, is also geared towards guaran-
teeing safe and healthy food for future generations, but to do this we must work together with the IOC to 
modernise and simplify standards and guarantee consumers more quality and food safety.’
It is worth listening to his speech again and again: it’s like a wish for the end of the year and a good start to 
2022.  A wish that we accept with great pleasure and that the IOC family extends with thanks to Commis-
sioner Wojciechowski.
TBILISI, GEORGIA  / The 114th session of the Council of Members, held in Tbilisi, Georgia in November 2021, 
created a space for the Executive Secretariat, member countries and the Georgian Chair to share ideas and 
intentions. A local news channel did a detailed report on exactly this, in which it stated that when the com-
mon objectives of the International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives 2015 are shared, cooperation 
bears fruit. A link to the full report can be found below.
