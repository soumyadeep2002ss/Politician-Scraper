A councilor (of "Council", and this one of Latin Concilium, 'Assembly'), mayor1 (from Latin Aedīlis, Roman magistrate) or councilor2 (from Latin regere, 'govern' and -dor) is a member selected for the Political administration of Spanish -speaking municipalities. These form the collegiate body that acts as a municipal government, and which receives different names according to the country and historical period (Municipal Council, City Council, Municipal Corporation, etc.).

The councilor is the elected member of a municipal entity, he exercises his mandate for a period whose duration is usually three to four years. The conditions of the election, the exercise, the continuity in the position and the possibility of re -election is at the end of each legislature, they depend on the electoral legislation and the local regime of each country.

Functions [edit]

The councilor has as a function the promotion of the development of the municipality within various areas (education, culture, health, transport, economy, farm, parks and gardens, public works, urban planning, etc.), for which it usually specializes as “councilors of area". It can also specialize in a district or other local spatial division. In addition, it plays the work of the work of the mayor of the city or population. Another position that usually exists is that of deputy mayor or vicealcalde. In some countries, the councilors, at the beginning of each municipal legislature, name among them who will be held by the mayor, and can even subsequently depose it and before their mandate ends through a motion of censure.

Terminology [edit]

In the Middle Ages and the Old Regime, both in Spain and in Latin America, the name of "councilor" was used because they exercised the regiment of their municipality, being between them two mayors: one by the plain state and one by the noble state.

Currently, in Spain the word "councilor" is usually used as an epithet to designate the mayor more than the councilors. In El Salvador, the councils are made up of mayor, trustee, and a number of councilors that varies between six and fourteen, according to the census; 3 However, the term councilors is usually used when referring generically to the members of the Council.4

Until 1973, in Chile it was called the councilor to the position today exercised by the councilor. Between 1927 and 1935, during and after the dictatorship of Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, they were called "Vocal." [Required event]

In Chile, there are a commission of councilors under the Chilean Association of Municipalities and a private proposal for the work with International Orb councilors, in which they show, through a councilor website, the issues of interest, work areas, information, information Legal, videos for candidates, etc. With a broad approach to councilors for Latin America, they also have a virtual magazine with issues of interest to councilors, it is the only magazine specialized in this issue in Chile and Latin America.
