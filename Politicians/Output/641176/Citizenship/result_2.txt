History links. Magazine of the Department of History of the University of Castilla-La Mancha
Juan Sisinio Pérez Garzón

We have defined the magazine with the name of links, because we think that all the social processes developed on the planet, whether economic, political or cultural, are interconnected in such a way that the best understanding of the past can only be done from that methodological starting point . A challenge that, therefore, links us to those who share, by trade, the desire to build a scientific-humanist knowledge of the past that allows contextualizing the present and guiding the future. The historical reason, in effect, can provide the different social groups and each of us both the understanding of the cultural legacy received and the socio -economic inheritances that their respective presents configure, as well as the existence of critical limits to credulity or mythical fantasy about the past. They are tasks of pedagogy, illustration and critical filter that must support the construction of new goals of human coexistence, settled on the progress of justice.
