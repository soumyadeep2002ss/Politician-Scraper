Italian Jewish realities are about to collect a complex challenge. What rules, what balances
assign to the way of being together and being rapresent? The themes of democracy, of the plurality of opinions, of
correct representativeness have always been very dear to a small reality in numbers, but bearer of ideas and cultures
important for the whole of the community. Many feel the need to adapt rules conceived in distant times.
Redise mechanisms and balances, increase the possibility of comparison, enhance local autonomies without for
this having to give up the national dimension. The challenges that must be addressed and the solutions that will be
freely adopted by the delegates of the Straodinario Congress of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities have a
meaning that goes beyond the dimensions of the Italian Jewish minority. To understand the elements in the center of the
Debate, Jewish pages offers the reader, starting from this number, elements of knowledge and comparison. To co-
minciance from the presentation of the first results of the work of the Commission for the reform of the statute.

The Council Ucei, in the meeting of 20 December 2009,
hto deliberate to submit to an extraordinary congress,
to be convened by June, the proposals for amendment
guy prepared by the Commission for the purpose established on the 8th
December 2008, which I have the honor of coordinating.
To share the decision it is necessary to answer affirmative-
mind to two basic questions:
1. It makes sense to convene, just at the expiry of the four -year period
of charge and on the eve of the useful date to keep the congress
ordinary delegates elected four years ago?
2. Does it make sense to change the statute so deeply?
The first question can be answered that only in this

the strengths of the reform project of the Statute
of Italian Judaism is undoubtedly counted the
new structure of relations between the distributed communities
on the territory and the central government bodies of the Union; rap-
ports that in the current statute are almost non -existent, in
how much the congress, despite being a widely rap-
presentative, does not ensure a stable and continuous connection-
between the electoral body, the councils of the communities and the junta
of the Union. One of the objectives of the reform is precisely that
to fill this gap, creating a permanent channel of
communication, direction and control between the various
territorial cation of Italian Judaism and the Union Council.

n. 3 | March 2010 Jewish part
way, even if not exempt from criticism, it can be concluded
A work that began - at the request of the 2006 congress
- in the current four -year period. Postpone everything to the new
congress and a new council would mean
from the begining. The second question requires a re-
move more articulated. Already Anselmo Calò, on these pa-
gine, showed the historical context in which the current was born
Statute, in the now distant 1987, and the substantial stability
Compared to the past of the most flashy aspects:
the organizational and territorial structure of the communities e
of the Union, remained in substance that of 1930,
as reviewed and corrected in 1968.
In the meantime, the world has changed and the baby too
Italian Jewish world has undergone changes
incisive, for better or for worse. I limit myself to two factors:
1. Participation in the 8 per thousand allocation has
brought a new vitality of the communities and a strong
dialectical tension between these and the union, with a request
of the communities to count more in decision -making processes
Ucei;
2. The historical compactness of Italian Judaism has made
feel some crews, with the appearance, so far em-
Brionale or a little more, of new movements, of the most different
religious approach.
The proposals developed by the Commission try to
sponde to the first question, acting on the com-
nity-union, while they basically ignore the second
from, which, sooner or later, will have to face: the advice
Ucei, also here at the request of the last congress, has
established a commission that carried out an interesting
investigation into non -orthodox realities present in the context
Italian Jewish. We therefore preferred to wait for that
The conclusions of the investigation are made public for
dere if it is necessary to adapt, even under this
profile, the organizational structures of Italian Judaism.
The revision proposal developed by the Commission
It is as a whole very organic. I limit myself to treating
the institutional structure of the Union and its relations with
the communities. The structure of the Union changes radically:
The congress that is held every four years disappears;
Instead of electing delegates to the congress, every four
nio the voters will be called to elect directly
a conspicuous part (36 out of 60) of the members of the Council
of the Union. In essence, between the electoral body and the
Siglio no longer interprets the congress, which elects in
seconddegree the advice, but this is partially elected
directly from the voters, partly composed of everyone
the presidents of the Italian communities, who acquire this
full voice in the chapter, becoming part of the
Menino of the Union, where 21 of the 60 represent
many. To get to the 60 members of the new organ,
Four rabbis must be added, two of which
they will elective and two of law: the chief rabbini of Rome
and Milan. It is a choice that has been contrasted, but
which responds to the need to strengthen representativeness
of the rabbinic component within the Council,
delay the chief rabbins of the two largest by right
community, so that the four rabbis (which
they will, as already today, the rabbinic council) are
at the representative of the reality of Italian Judaism.
The advice should meet - like the current one
- three or four times a year. With an important novelty
Compared to today, the Council, in the first meeting of
each year will form the calendar of their meetings,
also deciding the seat between the communities they have
declared his willingness to host him. It's a
way to further approach the communities to
the Union. The overall picture of the proposals formulated
from the commission it is, as I mentioned, very complex
and still in formation on some crucial points (such as
that of the relations between community and rabbed) but in
This location, with the little space available, limit myself
to emphasize as the new structure of the Union - with
a tip of about sixty components and one
junta of nine components plus the president, elected by
advice - goes in the sense of a stronger participation
of communities in the decision -making processes of Judaism
Italian and greater democraticity of the
feeling, through the direct election of the remaining part
of the councilors.

What would change if the reform proposal was implemented,
small and medium-sized communities could count on 6
Elected related and 19 presidents: 25 delegates out of 56, equal to 44.64
percent of the total not to mention the rabbis, or 27 delegates
out of 60 if you count two of the four rabbis, equal to 45 per
one hundred of the total.
The current situation the proposal was approved the
Major communities (Rome and Milan, which represent
Over 80 percent of Italian Jews) would sell one
share of representation to minor realities by decreasing the
own incidence. In the current Rome and Milan congress
control 64.71 percent of delegates (43.54+21.17
percent) and the 19 minor realities 35.29 percent. The new
structure provides for the presence in the council as a Mem-
Bri of the right of all the presidents of the Italian communities.

Local communities. The relationship between
Rome and Milan (the art realities

mouta is made more complex by profound differences in the di-
Mensions and in local characteristics. The distribution of
Jews in Italy in numerous small and very small communities

Trosatrists and testify to an ancient history e
glorious, deeply linked to the complex events that the
Peninsula has crossed over the millennia) constitutes a
value capable of giving the oldest reality of the diaspora
