World economic growth may slow from 2.7 per cent in 2023 to 2.4 per cent in 2024.

This was stated at a briefing by Shantanu Mukherjee, Director of the Economic Analysis and Policy Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, APA reported, citing TASS.

“Our report revealed that global growth will be 2.7 per cent in 2023. However, our forecast for 2024 has been reduced to 2.4 per cent,” Mukherjee said.

Mukherjee also said inflation should “come down to the 2 per cent target” in 2024. However, he added that the global economy is not yet out of the “danger zone” that could lead to recession.
