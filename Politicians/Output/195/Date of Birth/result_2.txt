Politicisation of the Attorney General[edit]

It has evolved into a customary practice for the Attorney General to submit their resignation upon the inception of a new government. As the appointee of the government, the Attorney General serves as its advocate, implying a lack of complete neutrality. Nevertheless, holding a constitutional mandate, the Attorney General's viewpoints are subject to public scrutiny. Nonetheless, instances have arisen where the Attorney General's positions appear to have been notably influenced by political considerations.[4]

During some of the AG tenures, it has been felt that the attorney general has gone too far. Niren De during Indira Gandhi replied to a question by Hans Raj Khanna stating that even the right to life can be suspended during emergency.[citation needed]

Similarly, in 2005, when the UPA government was planning a possible coalition with Mayawati, Milon K. Banerjee's opinion absolving Mayawati in the Taj corridor case was ignored by the Supreme Court.[5] In a direct condemnation of the government which asked the CBI to heed attorney general Milon Banerjee's opinion and close the case against Mayawati, the Supreme Court told the agency not to go solely on the AG's opinion and place all evidence before it.[6]

In 2009, Milon K. Banerjee's opinion absolving Ottavio Quattrocchi in the Bofors scandal has also been viewed as "devaluing and eroding the Attorney General's position".[4]

During the UPA-II government (2009–2014), the conduct of Attorney General Goolam Vahanvati was criticised in a number of cases. In 2G spectrum case, he became the first attorney general in India's history who had to testify as a witness in a corruption case in a trial court.[7][8] In late April 2013, in coal-gate scandal, Vahanvati was accused of misrepresenting facts in the top-most court of India.[9] Again in the same case, Vahanvati's role came under scrutiny after allegations of impropriety and coercion emerged from his junior law officer, Harin P. Raval, who resigned from the post of Additional Solicitor General as a result.[10]
