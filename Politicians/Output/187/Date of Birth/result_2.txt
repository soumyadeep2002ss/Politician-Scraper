Indubala (1898 – 30 November 1984), sometimes credited as Miss Indubala, Indubālā Debī, or Indubala Devi, was a Bengali singer and actress. She received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1975.

Early life[edit]

Indubala was born in Amritsar, the daughter of Motilal Bose and Rajabala. Her parents were with the Great Bengal Circus,[1] and separated soon after her birth. She lived with her mother in Calcutta. She trained as a singer in Calcutta with several teachers, including Gauhar Jaan,[2] Kamal Dasgupta, and Kazi Nazrul Islam.[3]

Career[edit]

Indubala is considered one of the great Bengali women singers.[4][5] She made her first of hundreds of recordings for Gramaphone Records in 1915 or 1916.[6][7] She performed on stage with her mother's company, the Rambagan Female Kali Theatre,[8] and at the Star Theatre. She sang on All India Radio beginning in 1927, on the broadcaster's second day on the air, and regularly through the 1930s.[9] In 1936 she was appointed court musician to the Maharaja of Mysore.[10] Beginning in the 1930s she provided playback vocals for sound films, and she acted on-screen in more than two dozen films, including Rajrani Meera (1933), Sati Sulochana (1934), and Naveena Sarangadhara (1936).[11] She retired from the stage in 1950. She received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1975.[1]

Indubala lived most of her life in the Rambagan neighborhood of Calcutta,[12] and was concerned for the welfare of the actresses and sex workers concentrated in that district. "I am Rambagan's Indu," she declared. "Here I have learnt music, established myself, and got respect."[8]

Personal life[edit]

After several years of declining health, Indubala died in 1984, in Calcutta, in her mid-eighties.[3] She is one of the title characters of Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's short story "Einstein and Indubala" (2016).[13] In 2020 a compilation album of Indubala's recordings was released on vinyl, by Tara Disc.[14]
