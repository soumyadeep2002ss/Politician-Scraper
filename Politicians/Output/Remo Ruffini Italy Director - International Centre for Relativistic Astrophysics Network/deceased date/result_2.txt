Special Issue Information

Dear Colleagues,

Remo Ruffini received his doctorate at Sapienza University of Rome, in 1967. Since then, he has become the director of ICRANet, the president of ICRA, and the coauthor of more than 650 scientific publications and 13 books. He has taught in Hamburg, at Princeton University, at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Japan, China (at USTC), Australia, and CBPF (Brazil). One of his major works concerned boson stars, named, “Introducing the Black Hole” with J.A. Wheeler, which focused on the limiting critical mass of NS. He identified the first black hole (BH) in our galaxy (Cignus X-1) using UHURU satellite data with Riccardo Giacconi and consequentially, he received the Cressy Morrison Award in 1973. He returned to Sapienza University in 1978, and he promoted a Rome–Stanford collaboration on the subject of gravitational wave detectors. Together with European, US, and Chinese institutions, he established ICRA and later ICRANet, in Italy, Armenia, France, and Brazil in 2005. He developed the understanding of GRBs, confirmed by the largest telescopes on Earth from their discovery in 1973, to their cosmological origin in 1997, and to the determination of seven different GRB families and their conceptual understanding in 2018.

This Special Issue will collect original and review papers written by distinguished scholars and dedicated to Remo Ruffini on the above mentioned topics.

The deadline for paper submission is April 30, 2023.

Manuscript Submission Information

Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website. Once you are registered, click here to go to the submission form. Manuscripts can be submitted until the deadline. All submissions that pass pre-check are peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will be published continuously in the journal (as soon as accepted) and will be listed together on the special issue website. Research articles, review articles as well as short communications are invited. For planned papers, a title and short abstract (about 100 words) can be sent to the Editorial Office for announcement on this website.

Submitted manuscripts should not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere (except conference proceedings papers). All manuscripts are thoroughly refereed through a single-blind peer-review process. A guide for authors and other relevant information for submission of manuscripts is available on the Instructions for Authors page. Universe is an international peer-reviewed open access monthly journal published by MDPI.

Please visit the Instructions for Authors page before submitting a manuscript. Submitted papers should be well formatted and use good English. Authors may use MDPI's English editing service prior to publication or during author revisions.

Spherically Symmetric C3 Matching in General Relativity
by Hernando Quevedo
Universe 2023, 9(9), 419; https://doi.org/10.3390/universe9090419 - 14 Sep 2023
Viewed by 688
Abstract We study the problem of matching interior and exterior solutions to Einstein’s equations along a particular hypersurface. We present the main aspects of the C3 matching approach that involve third-order derivatives of the corresponding metric tensors in contrast to the standard [...] Read more.

Binary Neutron-Star Mergers with a Crossover Transition to Quark Matter
by Grant J. Mathews,Atul Kedia,Hee Il Kim andIn-Saeng Suh
Universe 2023, 9(9), 410; https://doi.org/10.3390/universe9090410 - 07 Sep 2023
Viewed by 745
Abstract This paper summarizes recent work on the possible gravitational-wave signal from binary neutron-star mergers in which there is a crossover transition to quark matter. Although this is a small piece of a much more complicated problem, we discuss how the power spectral density [...] Read more.

Galaxy Rotation Curve Fitting Using Machine Learning Tools
by Carlos R. Argüelles andSantiago Collazo
Universe 2023, 9(8), 372; https://doi.org/10.3390/universe9080372 - 16 Aug 2023
Viewed by 858
Abstract Galaxy rotation curve (RC) fitting is an important technique which allows the placement of constraints on different kinds of dark matter (DM) halo models. In the case of non-phenomenological DM profiles with no analytic expressions, the art of finding RC best-fits including the [...] Read more.

Estimates of the Surface Magnetic Field Strength of Radio Pulsars

Abstract We investigate the geometry of the magnetic field of rotation-powered pulsars. A new method for calculating an angle (β) between the spin and magnetic dipole axes of a neutron star (NS) in the ejector stage is considered within the frame of [...] Read more.

Neutron Star Binaries Produced by Binary-Driven Hypernovae, Their Mergers, and the Link between Long and Short GRBs
by Laura M. Becerra,Chris Fryer,Jose F. Rodriguez,Jorge A. Rueda andRemo. Ruffini

Abstract The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model explains long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated with supernovae (SNe) Ic through physical episodes that occur in a binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion in close orbit. The CO core collapse triggers [...] Read more.

A Wheeler–DeWitt Quantum Approach to the Branch-Cut Gravitation with Ordering Parameters
by Benno August Ludwig Bodmann,César Augusto Zen Vasconcellos,Peter Otto Hess Bechstedt,José Antonio de Freitas Pacheco,Dimiter Hadjimichef,Moisés Razeira andGervásio Annes Degrazia

Abstract In this contribution to the Festschrift for Prof. Remo Ruffini, we investigate a formulation of quantum gravity using the Hořava–Lifshitz theory of gravity, which is General Relativity augmented by counter-terms to render the theory regularized. We are then led to the Wheeler–DeWitt (WDW) [...] Read more.

Abstract As with many fields from fashion to politics, science is susceptible to “bandwagon”-driven research where an idea becomes increasingly popular, garnering a growing amount of “scientific” support. Bandwagons allow scientists to converge on a solution, but when the prevailing bandwagon is incorrect or [...] Read more.
