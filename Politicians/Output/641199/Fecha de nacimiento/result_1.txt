"There is a boom in the practical application of AI and the part of R&D", Javier Muñoz-Gallego (Councilor for Digital Transformation and New Technologies of the City of Talavera de la Reina)
Protagonists Aapp
Dec 2123

  Javier Muñoz-Gallego and the Department of Computer Science of the City of Talavera

Talavera de la Reina has become one of the great headlights of digitalization in Spain. The Celebration of the Constituent Assembly of Gaia-X Spain or the Quatic 2022 International Conference is a good sample of this. But there is much more, as Javier Muñoz-Gallego, councilor for digital transformation and new technologies of the Consistory, who focuses on trends such as artificial intelligence to explain the modernization of his city.
Aappdigital: Talavera de la Reina has undoubtedly become one of the neuralgic centers of national digitalization. Not surprisingly, there were, for example, the Constituent Assembly of Gaia-X Spain or the Quatic 2022 International Conference. What do you think the city offers to the Nation as a whole and how it is affecting all this commitment to digitalization to development Talavera individual?

Javier Muñoz-Gallego: All these initiatives that you comment have put us on the national and international map, which implies that the city, in particular, has managed to arouse a talent. However, these types of tools, which help us so much, remain insufficient to be able to get a local development of talent for its volume and access difficulty. From the City Council we work, together with the Department of Computer Science, to enhance local projects from the beginning, so that we can keep them hand in hand to develop their entire panties and thus be able to use these national levers later. In this sense, I would like to highlight the work of the councilors who preceded me, fundamental for Talavera to be so well in the national digital ecosystem.


Aappdigital: In this work you comment, what trends are the most remarkable?

Javier Muñoz-Gallego: Many very interesting local ideas and initiatives are being born that, thanks to the aforementioned environment, they find professionals who dare to raise them. So we are in Talavera with projects applied to business, with innovative ideas for cable -free energy transmission or with the applied to bees, among the many proposals we have on the table today. As you can see, there is an boom in the practical application of AI and the R&D part.


Aappdigital: All these technologies already result in the constitution of what has come to call the smart city. What can we expect from Talavera as a smart city? Is there any project, in this area, which would like to stand out?

Javier Muñoz-Gallego: Yes. This journey to become Smart City has several already palpable conquests. I would highlight the following:
- The implementation of the Space Data Infrastructure (IDE) of Talavera, which ends this year and is already%A1%C2%A0a%20disposici%C3%B3n%20del%20ciudadano%2C%20pues%20queremos%20que%20todo%20el%20mundo%20sea%20part%C3%ADcipe%20y%C2%A0disfrute%20de%20unas%20verdaderas%20aplicaciones%20pr%C3%A1cticas.%0A-%20La%20sensorizaci%C3%B3n%20de%20contenedores%20de%20selectiva%20con%20GPS%20en%20los%20camiones%2C%20que%20permite%20el%C2%A0c%C3%A1lculo%20de%20rutas.%C2%A0%0A-%20Las%20luminarias%20inteligentes%2C%20con%20las%20que%20ahorramos%20energ%C3%ADa.%0A-%20El%20plan%20director%20de%20Smartcity%2C%20que%20marca%20las%20l%C3%ADneas%20a%20seguir%20a%20futuro.%0A%C2%A0%0A%0A%22Desde%20el%20Ayuntamiento%20trabajamos%20para%20potenciar%20los%20proyectos%20desde%20el%20inicio%2C%20de%20modo%20que%20podamos%20llevarlos%20de%20la%20mano%20para%20que%20desarrollen%20todo%20su%20potencial%22.%0A%0AAparte%2C%20tenemos%20como%20objetico%20este%20a%C3%B1o%20buscar%20una%20APP%2C%20que%20pueda%20usar%20el%20ciudadano%2C%20donde%20se%20puedan%20centrar%20las%20utilidades%20para%20que%20puedan%20ser%20usadas%C2%A0de%20manera%20eficiente%20en%20una%20misma%20plataforma.%0A%C2%A0%0A%C2%A0%0AAAPPDigital%3A%20Ya%20que%20hablamos%20de%20iniciativas%20de%20futuro%2C%20el%20%C3%BAltimo%20gran%20proyecto%C2%A0venido%C2%A0de%20su%20administraci%C3%B3n%20es%20la%20incubadora%20para%20startups%20llamada%20Talavera%20Tecnol%C3%B3gica.%20%C2%BFPuede%20explicarnos%20brevemente%20en%20qu%C3%A9%20consiste%20y%20tambi%C3%A9n%20de%20qu%C3%A9%20manera%20pondr%C3%A1%20a%20dialogar%20Talavera%20con%20el%20tejido%20empresarial%20nacional%3F%0A%C2%A0%0AJavier%20Mu%C3%B1oz-Gallego%3A%C2%A0Lo%20que%20queremos%C2%A0es%20que%C2%A0las%20startups%20no%20tengan%20que%20salir%20del%20entorno.%20En%20la%20actualidad%20esta%20iniciativa%20cuenta%20ya%20con%C2%A030%20proyectos%2C%20que%20estar%C3%A1n%20alojados%20en%20un%20edificio%20que%20inauguramos%20a%C2%A0final%20de%20a%C3%B1o.%20Es%20una%20iniciativa%20muy%20ilusionante.%20Se%20ha%20conseguido%20una%20gran%20colaboraci%C3%B3n%20con%20la%20RED%20de%20incubadoras%20de%20INCYDE%20y%20estamos%20seguros%20de%20que%20el%20proyecto%20va%20a%20dar%20que%20hablar%20a%20nivel%20nacional.%C2%A0%0A%C2%A0%0AEn%20este%20contexto%2C%20nuestro%20trabajo%20espec%C3%ADfico%20con%20los%20incubados%C2%A0es%2C%20una%20vez%20que%20hayan%20pasado%C2%A0por%20la%20mentorizacion%2C%20ayudarlos%20a%20sacar%20un%20MPV%20y%20ponerlo%20en%20marcha%20en%20la%20ciudad%20con%20clientes%20locales%20para%20mejorar%20la%20parte%20del%20tejido%20empresarial.%20Les%20ayudamos%20a%C2%A0hacer%20el%20banco%20de%20pruebas%20del%20producto%20de%20manera%20controlada%20para%20que%20asienten%C2%A0las%20bases.%0A%C2%A0%0A%C2%A0%0AAAPPDigital%3A%20Estos%20avances%20son%20s%C3%B3lo%20posibles%20mediante%20el%C2%A0di%C3%A1logo%20entre%20las%20administraciones%20y%20la%20empresa%20privada.%20%C2%BFTrabajan%20este%20di%C3%A1logo%20entre%20lo%20p%C3%BAblico%20y%20lo%20privado%20desde%20el%20Ayuntamiento%20de%20alguna%20forma%20en%20particular%3F%20%C2%BFHay%20alguna%20colaboraci%C3%B3n%20en%20el%20horizonte%20que%20nos%20pueda%20anticipar%3F%0A%C2%A0%0AJavier%20Mu%C3%B1oz-Gallego%3A%C2%A0Aqu%C3%AD%20s%C3%B3lo%20puedo%20decir%20que%2C%20efectivamente%2C%20hay%C2%A0grandes%20empresas%20interesadas%20en%20generar%20sinergias%20activas%20entre%20las%20administraciones%2C%20la%20UCLM%20y%20la%20comunidad%20local%2C%20y%20que%2C%20dentro%20de%20poco%2C%20vamos%20a%20alojar%20alg%C3%BAn%20piloto%20de%20producto%20de%20alguna%20operadora%20nacional%20que%20anunciaremos%C2%A0cuando%20lo%20tengamos%20preparado.%0A%C2%A0%0AAAPPDigital%3A%20Si%20esta%20comunicaci%C3%B3n%20entre%20la%20administraci%C3%B3n%20y%20la%20organizaci%C3%B3n%20privada%20es%20importante%2C%20no%20lo%20es%20menos%20la%20que%20surge%20entre%20administraciones.%20En%20este%20sentido%2C%20quer%C3%ADa%20preguntarle%20si%20hay%20alguna%20iniciativa%20a%20subrayar%20entre%20Talavera%20y%20otras%20localidades%20manchegas%2C%20as%C3%AD%20como%20entre%20su%20administraci%C3%B3n%20y%20otros%20ayuntamientos%2C%20cabildos%20o%20diputaciones%20nacionales.%0A%C2%A0%0AJavier%20Mu%C3%B1oz-Gallego%3A%C2%A0Nosotros%20compartimos%20informaci%C3%B3n%20por%20los%20medios%20que%20ya%20se%20crearon%20desde%20los%20ministerios%3A%20Red%20SARA%20para%20las%20comunicaciones%20seguras%20entre%20administraciones%2C%20plataforma%20de%20intermediaci%C3%B3n%20de%20datos%2C%20SIR%20para%20el%20intercambio%20registral%20con%20otras%20administraciones%20o%C2%A0Notific%40%20para%20notificaciones%20en%20DEH%C3%BA%20(direcci%C3%B3n%20electr%C3%B3nica%20habilitada%20%C3%BAnica).%C2%A0Ya%2C%20en%20particular%2C%20hemos%20hablado%20con%20la%C2%A0Junta%20para%20continuar%20con%20proyectos%20como%20Meta.%0A%C2%A0%0A%C2%A0%0AAAPPDigital%3A%20Y%20ya%20que%20hablamos%20de%20su%20consistorio%2C%20%C2%BFc%C3%B3mo%20se%20est%C3%A1%20modernizando%20el%20Ayuntamiento%20de%20Talavera%20de%20la%20Reina%3F%20%C2%BFQu%C3%A9%20proyectos%20han%20llevado%20a%20cabo%20en%20esta%20transformaci%C3%B3n%20y%20qu%C3%A9%20tecnolog%C3%ADas%20han%20sido%20las%20m%C3%Important?

Javier Muñoz-Gallego: Since the application of electronic administration was implemented in 2018, it has been integrating with different platforms, such as the data intermediation platform through the light client and web coating layer, which allows you to consult data from other administrations , speeding up the procedures and avoiding having to ask for that information from citizens and companies. There is also integration with Sir, the record exchange system, and notification, which generates notifications in electronic headquarters in Dehú.

We have also recently updated the municipal CPD, which has allowed us to increase our capacity both in process and storage. And we have improved availability, providing the system with a backup CPD in another location to maintain operability in case of contingency in the principal.


"A great collaboration has been achieved with the Incyde Incubators Network and we are sure that the project is going to speak at the national level."

Another very important point that we have updated is security. The system has been equipped with a double Firewall barrier and other advanced security elements. The 24x7x365 system is monitored from a SOC (Security Operations Center) that is integrated into the National Soc.

Other internal developments of interest are the new application of human resources or the IDE Talavera that was already summoned before. Currently the application we work with is an expert, of the company SPAI Innova. We have been working with her since 2018. In 2017 the tender was awarded and the implementation was made to start working in 2018. It is a gradual process in which it continually progresses. New procedures are still added to citizens and internal processes to expedite the processing to officials.


Aappdigital: Finally, how does this modernization of the City Council in the citizen on foot? What advantages can you already experience and what others think they will come in the near future?

Javier Muñoz-Gallego: On the one hand, from the hand of the electronic administration, a citizenship care office was implemented that improved the face-to-face attention that was carried out in the City Council. On the other, and in the future, the access channels will continue to be expanded. Information and direct participation channels will also be achieved for the user thanks to the bidirectional communication app, a unique tool where the experience of the citizen with Talavera de Reina are combined.
We pursue that in the city there is more digital information updated at street level so that the user has more data, that these are fluid and, incidentally, avoid signage spending.
