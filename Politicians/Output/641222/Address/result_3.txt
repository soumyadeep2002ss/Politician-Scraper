After the plenary session of the City Council of Torrent for the Legislature 2023-2027 that resulted in the proclamation of folk amparo as mayor of Torrent, last Saturday. The new mayor has organized her government team in seven major areas that are: Finance and Economic Development; Urbanism, housing and environment; Administration, information and women; Culture, failures, tourism and participation; Social services; Citizen Security and Mobility. Finally, the area of education, family, sports, parties and health.

Fruit of the agreement and the negotiation between Mayor Amparo Folgado and her first deputy mayor, Guillermo Alonso del Real (Vox), the new councilors already have the delegations in the new municipal government assigned.

Each year will be divided into subereas, among which some Spropios names, as linguistic competence, which will be mired by Vox, which will be in the Department of Family, Childhood and Linguistic Policy that María Angeles Lerma Cervera will direct. Also, as folgado already advanced, parties, also in the hands of the far -right formation, separates from failures and culture, in the hands of the PP. Something logical considering that this area is directed by Aitor Sánchez Collado, linked to the fallero world after being a manager of the Sant Valerià Falla and one of the drivers of the Commission D'Estudis Fallers Torrentins (Comfet).

Curious also the change of denomination of the Department of Equality, which is called the woman, and whose governor will be amparo chust.
