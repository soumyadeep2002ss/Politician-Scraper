Fernández was born in Lima, Peru. She is the daughter of Joffré Fernández Valdivieso, a constitutional lawyer and former Deputy and Minister of Justice from 1985 to 1990.

She studied law at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, ranking first in the 1977 graduating class. She continued advanced studies in Washington, D.C., gaining experience in civil procedure, arbitration, civil law, family law and international law.

Fernández was the vice chairman of the Lima Stock Exchange from 1988 to 1991 and Treasurer of the Board of the Lima Bar Association from 1993 to 1994. During this time, she was also appointed to various committee positions in the Peruvian government, including attorney ad hoc of the Supervisory Agency for Investment in Energy, alternate member of the committee to Protect Minority Shareholders of National Supervisory Commission for Companies and Securities (CONASEV).

In 2007, Fernández was named Minister of Justice, a position that she resigned from in 2009. The following year, she returned to the political scene to replace Víctor García Toma after the turbulence caused by the Legislative Decree No. 1097.[4]

She is married to lawyer Ernest Coz and is the mother of two daughters.
