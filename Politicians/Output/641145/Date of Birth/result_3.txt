Jerez de la Frontera, well known for its wines, its horses and its flamenco, preserves a historic centre that has been declared a historic artistic site.

One of the noblest towns in Cádiz brings together the splendour of aristocratic palaces with the popular flavour of typically Andalusian houses. Features that are shown off every year at the celebration of the Horse Fair, declared of International Tourist Interest. This enormous offer of culture is enriched with the aromas of a regional cuisine in which the Denomination of Origin of Jerez-Xérès-Sherry Manzanilla-Sanlúcar de Barrameda is outstanding. A visit to one of the city's wine cellars will help travellers to get a deeper understanding of its winemaking tradition.
