Jerez de la Frontera
Ciudad del Vino, the horse, the flamenco and the engine

Few places in Spain enjoy international recognition like Jerez enjoyed. Thanks to his wine -The "Jerez" or "Sherry" -, the equestrian and bullfighting tradition, flamenco and the engine, the name of this Andalusian city has long transferred borders.
The Phoenicians arrived 3,000 years ago to found the colony called Xera, the city that was later called Ceret under Roman domain, and Sheres or Xeres when it was Arab strength. With the Catholic Monarchs, the prosperous trade of their famous wines began with the English.

The Muslims left a deep footprint in the city, such as the urban layout of the neighborhoods nestled in the heart of the ancient Arab Medina: San Lucas and San Mateo, which hosts its homonymous church, the market square (headquarters of the Archaeological Museum) and The Riquelme Palace.

But without a doubt the most important Andalusian vestige is the Alcázar de Jerez, finding the mosque, the Arab baths and the garden of the olive trees, with pools and sources that harmonize perfectly with the Baroque Palace of Villavicencio, villavicencio, villavicencio, erected on the ruins of the primitive Islamic palace and in whose tower the visitor can visit the original dark camera.

Also recommended, visits to the Domecq Palace and the Viceroy Laserna Palace, which are part of the history of the Jerez town.

SINGULARITY

From the Gothic, the city has many valuable samples. In the Santiago neighborhood, the cradle of the Bulía, the church of Santiago, of the s. XV, who keeps the image of Jesus of the Prenndimiento, attributed to the Roldana; The Conventual Church of Santo Domingo and Church of San Marcos are also good examples of this style. All house some of the sizes that will process the streets of the city during Holy Week (Great Fiesta de Jerez together with the horse fair).

Very close is the cathedral, a beautiful baroque work of great monumentality. Inside, the choir stalls, the Virgin Girl of Zurbarán, an Immaculate of Vaccaro, a crucified of Juan de Arce and the Christ of the beam, Gothic of the s. XIV. The adjacent tower is built on the old Arab minaret.

San Dionisio. This church is one of the best models of Mudejar Jerez. It is nestled in one of the most charming placitas of Jerez, that of the Assumption, which also hosts the municipal council, splendid Renaissance work.

Cartuja de Santa María de la Defenion. Declared of cultural interest this monastery is considered the most important religious monument in the province. The flaming Gothic, plateresco and baroque rebirth shake hands in a harmonic structure, in which areas such as the entrance porch, the Chapel of Santa María de la Defenpiones or the Patio de los Arrayanes stand out for their beauty and charm. Visitable through concerted appointments or specific days. But in addition to its artistic value, the Cartuja has gone down in history because it is the cradle of the Cartujan horse. From the centuries. XVI and XVII The city acquires an economic thrust that attracts Genoese, English, flamingos, French, etc., that drive the city's trade and especially the Vinatero sector. This will mark the physiognomy of the city (when a multitude of wineries and houses are erectedrials).

But if what we want is to know Jerez and the Jerez, nothing better than a good walk along the long street, shopping and nerve center of the city. In it beats the pulse of the city, here the best stores and many terraces meet where to enjoy a copita and the rich Jerez caps. We can approach the Plaza del Arenal, the most emblematic of Jerez, to Mamelón, to the bench's placita, which boils of life and activity, to the Plaza Plateros or that of Rafael Rivero, cozy and full of terraces where to savor the rich gastronomy from the city.

Several options are raised for leisure time: the speed circuit, which usually hosts some test of the Motorcycling World Cup, the zoo, which houses the botanical garden inside. Not forgetting the museum centers such as the Atalaya, also known as the Time Palace, which collects a good number of watches of all time.

SAN MIGUEL. Gypsy flavor neighborhood, cradle of Lola Flores, is one of the most stately Jerez and at the same time of the most popular. Las Casas Palacio, such as the Villapanese Palace, make up the special idiosyncrasy of the neighborhood. In the heart of this one, the church of the same name rises, which began to be built in the s. XV, in Gothic style, although its facade is a good sample of the Baroque. He is worth seeing the main altarpiece, the work of Martínez Montañés and Juan de Arce.
