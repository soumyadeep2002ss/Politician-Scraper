A little history
History of the Alcazar

The origin of the city of Jerez is medieval. The appellation "of the border" was granted by King Juan I in 1380. In Muslim era it was called Sharish Saduna. With the updated data we have we can go back at the end of the ninth century or early X, although most Islamic constructions that are preserved correspond to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

Jerez is located on the left bank of the Guadalete River. Endowed with a large municipal term, one of the largest in Spain with 1189 square kilometers, offers a rich variety of reliefs and landscapes: the fertile Jerez countryside, Las Marismas, the Guadalete basin and the Sierra, so it is not Extract that in its term there are testimonies of human life from the most remote antiquity.

This area was intensely Romanized, as evidenced by the existence of the Roman city of Asta governed a few kilometers from Jerez, and which currently constitutes the archaeological site of Asta tables, the most important of the municipality.



First references



We have to go back to 844 to find the first references to Jerez in written sources. With the end of the caliphate and with the appearance of the independent kingdoms of Taifas, Jerez was at this time a small urban nucleus linked to the kingdom of arches. But in the mid -twelfth century, with the decline of the Almoravides, Jerez managed to become independent for a short period of time, until the arrival of the Almohades. With them, the city of Jerez and their Alcazar acquire true political and economic importance, becoming an urban nucleus of considerable dimensions.

It is at this time when the city wall is built (there was an anterior, much smaller walled, and that we do not know where exactly).

The walled enclosure floor is the shape of an irregular square, with four doors that opened on each side of this square. The perimeter of the walled enclosure was 3 kilometers, and was marked from towers to regular sections. The towers were rectangular and solid to the line of the wall, except two octagonal: one located in the southern vertex of the Alc√°zar, which is perfectly preserved, and another in the walled enclosure of the city, in the angle formed by the streets Porvera and Wide

The city was constrained and delimited by the wall, since like any medieval city, regardless of whether it was Muslim or Christian, it had to meet two fundamental requirements: to be fortress and market. The walls were sacred and outside them could not be lived with guarantees. The accesses to the city were done only through the four doors, from which the roads that led to the main cities of the environment and that closed at night for greater security. The doors opened between Torres and never with direct access, were doors in recoding with several turns, so that they were part of the city's defenses.

The quarterdeck



At the southern end of the walled enclosure, on the highest area of the historic center, the Alcazar rises. The location was not randomly chosen, since from here there is a complete domain of the city and its surroundings.
