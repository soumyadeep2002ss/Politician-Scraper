Municipal term of Jerez de la Frontera.
[edit data on wikidata]

Jerez de la Frontera is a municipality and city of Andalusia, Spain. With a population of 213 231 inhabitants in 2023.4 is the 60 largest in Spain, the 5th of Andalusia and the most populous in the province, as well as the Metropolitan Area of the Bay of Cádiz-Jerez, third urban conglomerate of Andalusia with a population of 639 560 inhabitants and an extension of 2026.3 km².5

It is located south of the Iberian Peninsula, 11 km from the Atlantic Ocean and 85 km from the Strait of Gibraltar. In a central and well -communicated position, Jerez has become the main communications knot in the province of Cádiz and one of the logistics and transport centers of Western Andalusia.6 Its size and growth capacity have given it greater dynamism economic than the provincial capital.7 8 9 10

Its municipal term occupies an extension of 1188.14 km² that extend over the Guadalquivir Valley.11 The municipality of Jerez has been the largest in Andalusia until the secession of San José del Valle in 1995, from that moment on the moment It is the second, just behind Córdoba, and sixth in Spain. In addition, it includes a wide extension of the Los Alcornocales Natural Park and the Sierra de Gibalbín, known as Jerez's Montes.12 It is episcopal headquarters of the Diocese of Asidonia-Jerez, taking the Guadalete River as a natural border.

On May 27, 2009, the Parliament of Andalusia unanimously approved the declaration of the municipality under the regime of organization of Law 8/08, of Cities of Great Population, 13 known as Law of Grande Andalusian Cities.14 15 GreatPart of the Historic Center of the city is very of cultural interest with the category of artistic historical complex.16

Toponymy [edit]

The Classic Latin Asta Name, without any connection with the current name, is applied to an old city that is today in Asta tables, about 11 km from the center of Jerez.

From the relative similar to the name, the place name "Jerez" has wanted to be derived from Xera, a supposedly Phoenician city near the Strait of Gibraltar.17 Subsequently, the Romans would have called it ceret, and the Visigoths Seritium or Xeritium.18 But the ancient cities closest to Jerez were the Punic city located in Mrs. Blanca and the Turdetana city of Asta Regia. The name of Seritium or Xeritium is only the Latinization of the Spanish name of Xerez in modern times. The supposed city of Ceret responds to the existence of a Turdetana currency with the Cerit or CERTI legend, and of some historical references to the ceretani, which were actually the inhabitants of the Etrusca city Caere, today Cerveteri. It is possible that the name of Jerez first documented in Arab texts, Šeriš, proceeds from the name of a vicus or industrial village where wines were made in jars or serious, which would have been pronounced seriously in late times.19

With the Muslim invasion, the settlement began to consolidate as a city and its denomination would evolve to the Arab form شريش Sherish.20 When the kingdom of Castile took Jerez on October 9, 1264 to the Muslims, in the period known as the reconquest, The city is called Xerez in medieval Castilian, representing the phoneme / ʃ / (similar to the English SH) with the grapheme «X», as it was a rule at the time. To Xerez would be added soon on the border, when he was on the border with the kingdom of Granada, and be a regular scenario of skirmishes and clashes between both kingdoms. More than two centuries later, after the conquest of Granada in 1492, Xerez loses his status as a border city, but does not lose such denomination. In the 16th century, the phoneme / ʃ / noticed «x» (xerez) evolves to the current phoneme / x / (jota), and in the 18th century the orthographic reform of the Royal Academy replaces the «x» by grapheme « J »(Jerez).

The ancient Xerez form was thus in the name that was given to the city in several foreign languages until a very recent past, and today the name given to Jerez wine continues to influence: in Portuguese and in Galician Xerez [ʃəˈɾ], in Catalan Xerès [ʃəˈɾs], in English Sherry [ˈʃeɹɪ], in French Xérès [gzeʀs], in Italian Xeres [ˈksɾes], etc.

History [edit]
Protohistory and old age [edit]

It is attested human presence in the area from the upper calcolithic or neolithic attracted by the natural wealth of the then existing Lacus ligustinus.21 The identity of those indigenous people with whom the Phoenicians were found, but the tartessos is attributed to the Tartessos, the tartessos is not very clear First major protohistoric settlement of the area around the III Millennium a. C.

In recent excavations carried out in July 2009 at the Alcazar de Jerez they have appearedCabañas funds as well as the footprint of the presence of old silos that seem to correspond to prehistoric vintage settlements, specifically the calcolithic period 5000 years ago.22

Since then seven cultures have passed through the municipality, Tartesia, Phenicia, Roman, Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Christian.

Its territory was exploited by the Phoenicians and then it was intensely Romanized, 23 of which numerous archaeological remains give faith, 24 especially from the city of Asta Regia, whose archaeological remains are found in the rural neighborhood of Tables of Asta.25 But although this territory was given the name of ager ceretanus mentioned by Columela, 26 This name really corresponds to the Etruscan city of Cerere.

Tartessic-Tourdetana [edit]
Main article: Asta Regia
Regia and other cities in the kingdom of Tartessos

Although some scientific base theories are not yet demonstrated to a population in Gibalbín, 27 it seems that the origins of the city of Jerez date back to the city of Asta Regia, founded by the Tartessos. Asta Regia (from Latin regĭus: Real) was an old city located in the rural neighborhood of tables of Asta, 8 km from the center of Jerez. Its origins date back to the final bronze, around 1200 a. C., as settlement founded by the ancient Tartessic civilization, reaching the hypothesis that it could become the ancient capital of the kingdom of Tartessos. Other studies suggest the possibility that it could have been a city of the ancient civilization of Atlantis.

Asta Regia, with an extension of 40 hectares, was located next to Lacus Ligustinus28 and was a coastal city that had its own port. The city was an important cultural and administrative center and acted as a control point of metal cargo

The city joined Gadir's circle through a commercial alliance. It was an emporium open to traffic of merchandise of Punic and Greek origin, and in which trade agreements were established. It is at this time when the name of the city changes to until Regia, for the commercial ties that the city had. The city already extended its influence to much of Western Turdetania. The city was embellished and consolidated its walled enclosure. Until Regia administered the territories of the interior of the province of Cádiz, while the Libiotic Factors of the coast (from Carteia or Baelo) would be in the orbit of Gadir.

After the fall of Tartessos in the year in 500 a. C., the notoriety of the settlement would depend on relations with the city of Gadir. Carthaginians and Greeks would then introduce a new type of exchange relationships, prioritizing raw materials to manufacturing, which would cause the appearance of a new commercial class, to the detriment of the old tartsic aristocracy and developed Gadir until it became polis.

Roman era [edit]
Main article: ager ceretanus

Until the outbreak of the Second Punic War (218 BC.-201 BC), the Turdetan cities, which were under the tutelage of Carthage from the Carthaginian invasion from 241 BC. C. After the defeat in the First Punic War, I do not maintainThere were any commercial relationship with Rome, but this new contest left open the possibility of new trade agreements. In 206 a. C., Gadir opened its doors to Rome, and later Asta, which like the rest of Turdetan cities opposed resistance, would fall before the Roman conquest. Since then Gadir's polis would have a preferential treatment in the region as a prize for its loyalty, although in Roman times the city of Asta was more important than other cities such as Baelo Claudia or Italica, hence its nickname of Regia.28

In 197 a. C., when Rome creates the province of Hispania further, substantially changed the territorial organization of Turdetania: it modified the borders and carried out a new administrative reorganization that meant the progressive incorporation of the territory of Asta Regia to Conventus Gaditanus, which also included the Ancient Punic cities in the south of the province of Cádiz and the Libiotenices of the Mediterranean. Asta Regia would finally be integrated to Gades. The city became a colony from which the development of the Romanization of the Jerez region was promoted.

It is in Roman times when the region becomes important. Its territory was an important agricultural area in the Roman era, within the current term of Jerez de la Frontera. This territory has been given today the name of ager ceretanus mentioned by Columela, attributing it to Jerez with the support of a Turdetana currency with the legend Cerit or CERTI and an image of the goddess Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture, the crops and fertility. Also today we can observe a statue to Ceres in the Alameda Vieja and a Jerez neighborhood is named Ceret Alto.

Many historians support the theory that the Roman urban core ceret, together with the settlement of Asta Regia, is the Roman ancestor of the city of Jerez de la Frontera.30 in addition to the phonetic translation ceret - seritium - sherish - jerez, the Identification also rests on the basis of numismatic testimonies, other possible epigraphic and firm literary documents.31 Another theory argues that the name of Jerez, first documented in Arab texts such as Šeriš, can proceed from the name of a vicus or village of Industrial character where wines were made in jars or serious, pronounced will be in late times.19

With the fall of the Roman Empire, all Hispania was invaded by barbarian peoples of Germanic origin, being Hispania under Visigothic domain since 507. For a brief period of time, areas of the south of the Iberian Peninsula entered the orbit of the Byzantine empire forming Part of the province of Spania, for a short period of time, since the Visigothic kingdom of Toledo with the military campaigns of Leovigildo and Suintila, recovered the Mediterranean coast thus unifying the entire peninsula under the same kingdom.

In full civil war between Rodrigo and Agila II (Witiza Successor), the Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula would begin. General Tarik, with the help of the Visigoth supporters of Agila II, who received the Berbers, filed a battle against Rodrigo in the vicinity of the Guadalete River, near

discovery of America and the conquest of Granada, in 1492, facilitated that Jerez was one of the most prosperous cities of Andalusia thanks to trade and their proximity to the ports of Seville and Cádiz. In fact, the strategic situation of the city caused Felipe II 480 cities of the world that are part of the civitates orbis terrarum.44

During the 16th century, the time of the reign of Felipe II the city had approximately 25,000 inhabitants and was one of the most important cities in peninsular Spain.45 During that century a noble intellectual group highlighted who, together with the clergy, stood out intellectually in the country. 46

Although in the seventeenth century the political, economic and social decline (and even demographic for epidemics) 47 of the Spain of the last Austrias also leaves its mark in the city, this does not prevent that during the next century, the city will continue with Good rhythm a new stage of modernization and development. From then on Jerez becomes worldwide famous and recognized by its wines, especially the wine called Jerez (Sherry, in English), and their numerous wineries are of great recognition.48

In 1810, during the reign of José Bonaparte, and according to the project of the Clerican Clerican, a new administrative division of Spain was carried out in 38 prefectures, 49 equivalent to the current provinces. The new prefectures were carried out based on zero and ignoring previous historical conditions and were governed exclusively for social and economic issues, and thus were called with the name of the nearest geographical accident. Jerez was appointed capital of the "prefecture of the Guadalete", 50 51 49 although it was common to refer to it as "prefecture of Xerez" .49 51 50 The prefecture chancery was in Seville.49 This this Administrative division, still in force at the political level, never became effectively carried out due to the drift of the War of Independence. During this war, Jerez suffered the occupation and looting of local municipal units and churches from February 4, 1810 to the French withdrawal on August 26, 1812, which caused an important resistance among its population, which was organized for fighting the invader

Mendizábal's confiscation meant the sale, in 1837, of the four paintings of the main altar of the monastery of the Cartuja that are now in the Grenoble Museum in France. Even so, most Zurbarán works are preserved in the Cádiz Museum.

The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries took industrialization to the city, and the arrival of the first railway line of Spain that would unite JereZ with in the port of Santa María in 1854 and with the area of the Trocadero, in Puerto Real in 1856.53 54 This line is created in order to transport wine boots from Jerez to the closest ports for later export. In 1870 an urban railway was built that connected several wineries. Since 1860, the city had gas lighting and, since 1869, it had current water brought from Tempul after a great engineering work.55 The Firefighters Consortium was also created, 56 one of the first in Spain before the common Combustion in the warehouses of the wineries when distilled.57 and also emphasizes that the local police body created in 1841, which was the second in the country.58

The 19th -century Jerez Society had a dual structure, a small group of citizens formed the bourgeoisie, in which the great owners, the exporters of wines and much of the nobility were integrated, at the other extreme were the popular classes, the popular classes were, the rural and urban proletarian.59 This duality structure led to several peasant uprisings that the Government tried to control running the rumor of the existence of the black hand (1882-1884), a species anarchist secret society of the Andalusia that He said in Jerez its central nucleus during the second half of the nineteenth century. This was the government excuse that was raised for the repression and exemplary adjustment of several farmers.

On May 21, 1890, in ordinary session, folio 266, of the City of Jerez de la Frontera, it is indicated that after the test of two lamps of four lights each made in front of the town hall, the installation of twenty -two street lamps is approved In two nearby streets that were mounted in July of the same year.60 Jerez is therefore the first city of Spain to have public lighting for electricity, although this historical circumstance is also claimed by the town of Haro, in La Rioja. The truth is that both cities installed the electric lighting almost in unison, although Jerez had the first electric street lamps in its streets, Haro was the first to completely finish the lighting in the framework of its streets.60 one hundred years later, On September 17, 1990, to commemorate this fact, both cities began a twinning process, which did not be completed due to protocol circumstances.61

At the beginning of the 20th century Jerez struggled to fight the plague that destroyed European vines and caused the crisis in the cities that depended on wine almost exclusively. Jerez refused, replanted his vineyards with American vines, integrated new agricultural products in its agricultural structure and diversified its industry. However, the subsequent crisis in the winemaker caused the abandonment of artistic value winery infrastructure.62

After the civil war, the importance of the city in the postwar period was such (with a large number of industry) 63 that the possibility of establishing maritime communication with Cádiz was studied through the port of San Telmo, a project that never came to be consummated. During the Francoist period, the history of the city is parallel to that of the country: economic depression, autarchy, developmentalism of the 1960s and democratic system. Between 1940 and 1950 the ruleor favored the creation of up to eight new villages of colonization in the countryside of Jerez.64

Already in the democratic period, a deep transformation was carried out in the city, making important investments for the outside, such as the Jerez circuit or the presence in Expo 92. Between 2000 and 2002 the elevation works of the railways of the railway tracks are carried out in the northern part of the city and a small underground in the southern zone. In January 2007, the new West Circunvalación of the A-4 highway passes through the city and the first expansion phase of Jerez airport ends. That same year, three new delegations protected by the Law of Grandes cities are created: South District, North District and Granja-Delicias District.

On May 27, 2009, the Parliament of Andalusia unanimously approved the declaration of the municipality under the regime of organization of Law 8/08, of Cities of Great Population, 13 known as Law of Grande Andalusian Cities.14 With the continuation of The reforms at the Jerez airport, in 2010 it was achieved that the terminal will double its capacity and a new building was built to park vehicles.65 The following year, the railroad station next to the airport where they stop near and a half distances came into operation .

Wine [edit]
Main article: Jerez (wine)
Inside a lustau winery
Traditional Tabanco de la Ciudad

The history and development of the city of Jerez (including its architecture) 252 have been historically linked to the wine industry.

The first vines were brought by the Phoenicians to the Jerez area around 1100 a. C. A very imperfect wine was made, which was cooked so that it would not spoil with transport. It had a very high graduation. In 138 a. C. EMILIANO Pacifica the region and begins to export products to Rome: wine, olive oil and garum (a fish paste similar to pickled).

In 711, the Arab domination of Spain begins, but wine is still consumed despite the prohibition of the Quran. In 966, Almanzor, Vizier del Califa Alhaken II, decides to start the vines, but the Jerez convince the caliph that the raisin grapes give energy to the soldiers, and it is possible to keep a third of the vines.

In 1264, with the reconquest of Jerez by Alfonso X the Wise, wine consumption extends. Christians drank wine and ate pork to differentiate themselves from Muslims. They even gave it to drinking horses before battles. Already then, in the twelfth century, wine was sent to England, where it began to be known by the Arab name of the city, Sherish, origin of the word Sherry.

How to take a catavino not to heat the wine with your hand

In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Jerez's wine becomes a source DAnd wealth for the region, is protected by the king and exports to England, France and the Netherlands. As an example, in all the ships that went to America, one third of the load for wine was reserved.

In 1587 Martin Frobisher, from Francis Drake's fleet, attacked Cádiz and Jerez, taking 3000 boots of these wines. This booty put Jerez in the English Court.253

From 1682, after some violent attempts, the English decide to bring the wine peacefully, and English businessmen are established in Jerez, founding wineries such as: Garvey, Duff-Gordon, Wisdom & Warter, Osborne. After them came the repatriated Spanish capitals after the independence of the colonies (González, Marqués de Misa) as well as the French Domecq254 or Lacave.

The denomination of Jerez-Xérès-Sherry origin was created in 1935 (being the first in Spain), and helped popularize wines by Spanish geography during the dictatorship 256

However, in the late 1980s the sector suffered a sharp crisis, mainly due to the decrease in national demand, despite being a worldwide known wine. This crisis affected the city's economy, which has sought to diversify its industrial fabric.

At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a resurgence of tabanco as a place of leisure and wine test.

Related to the production of Jerez are the Brandy of Jerez and the vinegar of Jerez, both protected by the designation of origin. As well as the Race of Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz.

In 2014 it was the European wine city, appointed by Recevin (Network of European Wine Cities) 257

Music [edit]
Moraito Chico

In the field of Jerez popular music, zambombas are characteristic, 258 very lively and busy meetings that are celebrated around Christmas Eve, in which the song of Christmas Christmas carols is essential (normally conditioned by bulerías). Especially characteristic are the repetitive Easter romances. Likewise, flamenco and popular culture often impregnate Christmas celebrations.259

In the field of cultured or academic music, there are several works whose title refers to Jerez. The eleventh piece of the Iberia Suite (1905-1908) by Isaac Albéniz is titled Jerez. Of 1928 are the symphonic notes Jerez Campos of Germán Álvarez Beigbeder, as well as the Jerez Suite for Guitar and Orchestra, a compilation of music of the same composer made by his son José María Álvarez-Beigbeder Pérez. The work Campos Jerez was also reitreed posthumously by his son to Andalusian fields, to make known in our land so excellent work. Likewise, the Cordoba musician Joaquín Villatoro Medina, who was director of the municipal band from 1962 to 1980, composed the work Jerez: singing to wine and work. And more recent, we find the work of the dance of the steeds of Luis Cobos.

Known Jerez artists are the composer Manuel Alejandro (son of also Jerez Álvarez Beigbeder), David Demaría, the Los Delinqüentes group, the tenor Ismael Jordi, José Mercé, Jesús Méndez, María Carrasco or the rap singer La Mala Rodríguez, and the talented Flemish guitarists Manuel Valencia, Menuito and Miguel Salado.

As for the musical offer, the Villa TheaterMarta is an important lyrical theater in Andalusia.

Currently in Jerez has his municipal band, founded in 1930 by the illustrious Jerez composer Germán Álvarez Beigbeder, having been directed throughout his history by famous musicians such as Moisés Davia, Joaquín Villatoro, José Ramón Cabrera or Francisco Orellana. It also has two orchestras: the young Philharmonic Orchestra Campos Andaluces (JOFCA), founded by young musicians of the city, with Pedro Gálvez at the head, and has members from the entire province of Cádiz. Despite its short trajectory, and if much of it has been affected by the Coronavirus pandemic, it has already been awarded in Moscow on the occasion of its representation of the gypsy ballet The love sorcerer of failure.260 This orchestra is associated with the Eurochesties International, whose international festivals of young orchestras and choirs are the longest and most prestigious in the world. We also found in the city the Álvarez Beigbeder orchestra, in operation since 1998, founded by the Georgian violist Archil Pochkua (professor at the Royal Symphony Orchestra of Seville) and the Jerez lawyer Antonio de la Herrán. This orchestra has traveled to France, Canada, China and Russia by the hand of the Eurochetries festivals on numerous occasions, has interpreted numerous zarzuelas in conjunction with the Coral of the UCA (directed by Juan Manuel Pérez Madueño). It has a formative project, the young Jerez Camerata, where smaller musicians learn to form in orchestral practice. It is under the musical direction of José Colomé. There are also various musical groups, such as AM San Juan or the AM The sentence with more than thirty years of history.261

The horse has played a key role in Jerez's story. Since the time of the Phoenicians (IV A. C.) there were already testimonies written by Greek historians about the special care given to horses in the area. The first horsepower that SAnd he gave in Jerez dates from the times of the Muslim conquest, when they crossed their Arab horses, known as pure Arab blood, with the local horse, resulting in the famous Spanish Arab horse, popularly known as pure Spanish blood or Andalusian horse. 269 In the fifteenth century the monks of the Cartuja de Jerez carried out a new crossing has lasted to this day.271

Likewise, the sport of the pole was also very important, which had a club in 1870 (one year after the sport) 272 and the jockey.273 although some infrastructure have been lost (such as the Chapín racecourse), 274, 274 It maintains various infrastructure related to its upbringing and exploitation.

Religion [edit]
Main article: Diocese of Asidonia-Jerez
Easter

Religion with more practitioners in Jerez is, like the rest of Spain, Catholic Christianity. There are numerous temples and sacred places for the cult of this religion in the city. However, in the city there are several non -Catholic temples, such as mosques and evangelical churches. The municipal cemetery of Jerez has facilities for burial through the Islamic rite.287 288

Jerez has great autonomy in its ecclesiastical administration in Andalusia, it is the only non -provincial city, along with Guadix, which is the episcopal headquarters of a Catholic diocese. The Diocese, called Asidonia-Jerez in honor of the former Diocese of the Arab Province of Saris, 289 covers the northern strip of the province of Cádiz, taking the Guadalete River as a natural border to the south.
