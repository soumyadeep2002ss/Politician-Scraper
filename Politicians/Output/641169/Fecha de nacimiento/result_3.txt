0Catalan as their mother tongue.

It has close similarities to both French and Portuguese due to its Roman roots. Catalan was once considered a dialect of either French or Occitan (aka Provençal) rather than its distinct language until the 19th century!

The Catalan Spanish language contains many influences from French, Italian, and Arabic languages which sets it apart from Castilian Spanish. Furthermore, each area within Catalonia where Catalan is spoken has its unique dialects and accents which add even more variety to its already diverse soundscape.

That said, many people consider Catalan a separate Spanish language today - so be sure to brush up if you plan on visiting any Catalan-speaking areas during your stay in Spain.

Basque (Euskera)

Basque (also known as Euskara) is an interesting case because it does not have any clear linguistic relationship with any other language - not even Latin or Iberian like many other Romance languages do.

The Basque language is an ancient language native to the Basque Country in northern Spain and southwestern France. It’s believed to be one of Europe’s oldest living languages with some sources tracing its origin back to over 5000 years ago!

In addition, Basque has three different dialects which can be heard throughout various parts of Northern Spain depending on where exactly you're located!

While only 6% of people in Spain claim Basque as their first language, it remains an important part of Spanish culture and history with many official documents being translated into Basque for use by citizens of both countries.

Galician

Galician is spoken mainly in northwestern Spain and a few areas bordering Portugal. It belongs to the Romance language family and has its distinct grammar, vocabulary, and dialect - which are all very similar to Portuguese. The Galician language also has a rich written tradition that dates back centuries. Interestingly enough, many Spanish people consider Galician an official language; however, the government does not recognize it as such due to its similarities with Portuguese.

Aranese

Aranese is an endangered Spanish language spoken mainly in Catalonia's Val d'Aran region. Aranese is a Romance language with its dialect. It is spoken primarily in the Val d'Aran area of Catalonia and is mutually intelligible with Catalan, although it has some distinct features like its own phonology and grammar. It belongs to the Occitan language family and has been used since at least the 11th century. The language is taught in some schools as part of a program for minorities sponsored by UNESCO.

Aranese has official status in Catalonia as a co-official language along with Catalan and Spanish. Unfortunately, there are fewer than 10 thousand native speakers left - most of whom are elderly - and thus it is considered an endangered language by UNESCO.

Asturian-Leonese Language

The Asturian-Leonese language family is one of several Romance languages spoken in Spain. It is composed of three distinct languages - Asturian, Leonese, and Mirandese (Bable, León, and Mirandés) - all of which are closely related and mutually intelligible. The language is spoken predominantly in northern Spain, particularly in the regions of Asturias and Leon. An estimated 1 million people speak some form of these dialects, making it one of the most widely spoken Romance languages in Europe.

The origins of Asturian-Leonese can be traced back to Latin, which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by Roman settlers around 2,000 years ago. Over time, this language evolved into different dialects due to its geographic isolation from other Romance languages.

Unlike Aranese or Galician which have had a long history of beingused for literary purposes, Asturian-Leonese was mostly used orally until very recently when efforts were made to put it into writing so that it wouldn't become extinct completely. Today, all three dialects are officially recognized by their respective regional governments as co-official with Castilian Spanish.

Aragonese Language Family

Another lesser-known but fascinating Romance language found in Spain is Aragonese. It is closely related to Catalan and Castilian Spanish and is spoken mainly in two autonomous communities - Aragon and Navarre - in northern Spain. It was traditionally only spoken by rural populations living in isolated villages; however, it has become increasingly popular over time due to efforts by local activists and organizations who have worked to preserve that Spanish language. It enjoys official status as a co-official language alongside Spanish in certain areas. An estimated 40 thousand people currently speak Aragonese today.

As you can see, there are a variety of different languages spoken in Spain! From Castilian Spanish which is used as the official language throughout the country to regional dialects such as Catalan and Basque which have been preserved for hundreds if not thousands of years - there's something for everyone when it comes to exploring Spain's linguistic diversity! Whether you're a linguistics enthusiast or just looking for something new to learn while visiting - learning about these different languages can help you gain a deeper appreciation for Spanish culture!
