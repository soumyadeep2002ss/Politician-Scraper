Do you know the difference between Gender Equality and Gender Parity? 

Although often used interchangeably, these terms hold distinct meanings. Gender Equality implies equal rights, opportunities, and treatment for all individuals, regardless of gender. 
Conversely, Gender Parity focuses on achieving equal representation of men and women in specific areas like #education, workforce, or #leadership roles. While Gender Equality is the broader goal, Gender Parity is a crucial step toward its realization.
