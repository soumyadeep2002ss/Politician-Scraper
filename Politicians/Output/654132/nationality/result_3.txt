It has been inspiring to witness the incredible participation today, as we marked this #UNDay and kicked off the year of the United Nations Global Service Centre‚Äôs 30th anniversary.¬†
¬†
From the dedicated personnel of #UNGSC and partner organizations who walked side by side in #Brindisi, to the hundreds of students, #UN entities, local, and international NGOs who gathered at the City of Arts and Sciences in #Valencia, today‚Äôs events have been heartening, for us all.¬†
¬†
Even amid great challenges and divisions, we can find strength and unity in our shared mission to build a more inclusive, innovative, and peaceful world.

Yesterday marked a significant milestone for the United Nations Global Service Centre, as we had the honour of hosting a pivotal technical roundtable chaired by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Ministero degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale, bringing together over 30 key strategic stakeholders.
This forum served as a crucial platform, fostering the enduring dialogue that the UN has maintained with local and national entities for nearly three decades while providing an invaluable opportunity to align on future synergies.
We explored avenues to enhance the #UN support capabilities, to increase local infrastructures and services, as well as to strengthen the strategic positioning of the UN Hub and the city of #Brindisi, responding to the needs of the international community.
I extend my sincere gratitude to the representatives from the Ministero degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale, Ministero della Difesa, Ministero delle Infrastrutture e dei Trasporti, Agenzia Dogane e Monopoli - ADM, Autorit√† di Sistema Portuale del Mar Adriatico Meridionale, Capitaneria di Porto di Brindisi, Comune di Brindisi, Provincia di Brindisi, Regione Puglia, ENAC - Ente Nazionale per l'Aviazione Civile, AEROPORTI DI PUGLIA SPA, Aeronautica Militare, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane S.p.A., Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, ANAS SpA, Mercitalia Logistics, for their active participation and for reaffirming the importance of the #UNGSC as a unicum whose permanence and development is fundamentally interlinked with its territory and host country. Thanks also to #UNHRD/World Food Programme colleagues, for the cooperation and critical partnership. 
Together, we can pave the way for a future marked by collaboration, growth, and shared progress, for a long-lasting impact on a global scale.

A warm thank you to all the charities and social associations for joining us today at the United Nations Global Service Centre's Solidary Fair.
¬†
In a world marked by division, challenges and conflicts, this year we chose #solidarity to be our guiding principle. As we acknowledge the shared responsibility we bear in shaping a world that is just, compassionate, and united, we want solidarity to be not only a theme but a daily call to action.
¬†
Thanks also to all #UNGSC colleagues, friends and families for their presence today, in the spirit of sharing and giving that binds us together as a global community.¬†¬†

It was encouraging to hear chiefs of missions coming from the field say, while having a tour of our base in Brindisi, that ‚Äúa full day is not enough to see all the innovative solutions and services that the United Nations Global Service Centre provides‚Äù.¬†From containerized renewable energy solutions to 3D-printed accommodation that uses local soil and can be designed to blend into the local communities, to mobile repair workshops and much more, our #SolutionFactory serves the needs of the field.

I would like to thank the Chiefs of Mission Support Mr. Andrew Brimelow (#UNMHA), Mr. Jorge Goncalves (#UNAMA), and Mr. Robert Kirkwood (#UNISFA) for their visit to #UNGSC and the great two-way exchange. It was a pleasure having them here, listening to their experience and discussing how to concretely tailor solutions for operations in Yemen, Afghanistan and Abyei. I look forward to continuing these inspiring conversations to shape the future of our service provision.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy, H.E. Antonio Tajani, and counterparts from Bulgaria, and North Macedonia visited the United Nations Global Service Centre (#UNGSC), Brindisi, on 27 July.

On behalf of the host country, Minister Tajani reiterated Italy's dedication to the United Nations and support for UNGSC‚Äôs presence in Brindisi. ‚ÄúYou can count on us‚Äù, Minister Tajani said.

The high-level visit concluded a series of activities in the city of Brindisi, building on the momentum of the pan-European Corridor 8, which links the Italian ports of Brindisi and Bari to Western Balkan and Eastern European nations.

The Director of UNGSC was joined by the Coordinator of the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot /¬†World Food Programme¬†(#UNHRD/WFP), in greeting the delegation and presenting the Base, highlighting UNGSC‚Äôs role as an integrated hub for peace, security, and humanitarian operations, as well as its capabilities for global crisis response.

It was my pleasure to meet with Mr. Giuseppe Marchionna, the newly elected Mayor of Brindisi. 
We are and have always been grateful to the City of Brindisi which, since 1994, has welcomed the United Nations Global Service Centre and its vibrant international community.
We will work together on the many areas of common interest so that Brindisi can be recognized worldwide as the ‚ÄúCity of Peace‚Äù.
