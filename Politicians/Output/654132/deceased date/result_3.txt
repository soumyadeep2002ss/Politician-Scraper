Yesterday marked a significant milestone for the United Nations Global Service Centre, as we had the honour of hosting a pivotal technical roundtable chaired by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Ministero degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale, bringing together over 30 key strategic stakeholders.
This forum served as a crucial platform, fostering the enduring dialogue that the UN has maintained with local and national entities for nearly three decades while providing an invaluable opportunity to align on future synergies.
We explored avenues to enhance the #UN support capabilities, to increase local infrastructures and services, as well as to strengthen the strategic positioning of the UN Hub and the city of #Brindisi, responding to the needs of the international community.
I extend my sincere gratitude to the representatives from the Ministero degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale, Ministero della Difesa, Ministero delle Infrastrutture e dei Trasporti, Agenzia Dogane e Monopoli - ADM, Autorità di Sistema Portuale del Mar Adriatico Meridionale, Capitaneria di Porto di Brindisi, Comune di Brindisi, Provincia di Brindisi, Regione Puglia, ENAC - Ente Nazionale per l'Aviazione Civile, AEROPORTI DI PUGLIA SPA, Aeronautica Militare, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane S.p.A., Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, ANAS SpA, Mercitalia Logistics, for their active participation and for reaffirming the importance of the #UNGSC as a unicum whose permanence and development is fundamentally interlinked with its territory and host country. Thanks also to #UNHRD/World Food Programme colleagues, for the cooperation and critical partnership. 
Together, we can pave the way for a future marked by collaboration, growth, and shared progress, for a long-lasting impact on a global scale.

Do you know the difference between Gender Equality and Gender Parity? 

Although often used interchangeably, these terms hold distinct meanings. Gender Equality implies equal rights, opportunities, and treatment for all individuals, regardless of gender. 
Conversely, Gender Parity focuses on achieving equal representation of men and women in specific areas like #education, workforce, or #leadership roles. While Gender Equality is the broader goal, Gender Parity is a crucial step toward its realization.
