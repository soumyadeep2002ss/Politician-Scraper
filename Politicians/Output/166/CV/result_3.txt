THE TRAINED  NURSES’  ASSOCIATION  OF  INDIA
Empowering Nurses, for Better Patient Outcomes
O
nly the one endowed with power can help another one who has little or no power! It is by being
empowered that nurses can perform their role more effectively. At the same time, powerless
nurses find it difficult to put in their best in discharge of their performance and do not show
excellent results. Consequently they themselves do not derive as much satisfaction as others from the
job at  hand, so do  the patients they  are required to take  care of. They  are also likely  to undergo
monotony or burn outs more frequently. Lack of nursing power may also contribute to poorer patient
outcomes, as Manojlovich & DeCicco said.
As in other aspects of life, advances in technology shall render many of the traditional nursing ways
and practices redundant. If we have to keep going and grow, there is no option but to embrace the new
technology and knowhow. Further, this learning spirit has to be maintained. Else we shall have little or
no role, like the body parts not being used can become dysfunctional over years.
In  broad terms,  power is  "the  ability to  get things  done, to  mobilise  resources, to  get and  use
whatever it is that a person needs for the goals he or she is attempting to meet". Nurses can be said to
stay powerful by gaining control over the content of practice and demonstrating their competence. Of
course, it presupposes that nurses have mindset to adopt the best practices in their daily job. Dealing
with daily stresses shall not be an issue with such mindset. A natural corollary is, of course a better
nursing career. No mission can be achieved in isolation. For the desired objective to be achieved, one
has also feel comfortable in networking and seeking support from outside sources. Empowerment of
nurses also necessitates that they remain united for their cause.
   I repeat what we have been emphasising in these pages, a bright future awaits the aspiring
nurses who have pride in Nursing profession, confident of their academic base and imbued with ‘to
do’ spirit.
   Let me also inform you about the next SNA Bi-
ennial  Conference  on  the  theme,  Empowering
Nurses  through  Advanced  Technology  shall  be
hosted by TNAI Andhra Pradesh. Please also note
that Government of India has issued notification

ingale Nurses Awards 2017, with 31 March 2017
as last date for receipt of entries (details are given

World Cancer Day:  4 February
World Cancer Day (WCD) on 4 February is the initiative of Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)
to raise awareness of cancer and to encourage its prevention, detection and treatment. Presently
around 8.2 million people die from cancer worldwide every year; out of these some 4 million people
mostly aged 30 to 69 years, die prematurely. World Cancer Day, a truly global event, an opportunity to
spread the word and raise the profile of this desease in mind of people and in the media. It is a Day to
unite the world’s population in the fight against cancer.
Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells. WHO holds that a significant proportion of
cancers can be cured, by surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, especially if they are detected early.
The growth of cancer often invades surrounding tissues and can metastasise to distant sites. However,
many cancers can be prevented by avoiding exposure to common risk factors, such as tobacco smoke.
The tagline of World Cancer Day 2016-2018 i.e. ‘We can. I can’ suggests that as a collective or as
individuals – can do their part to reduce the global burden of cancer. Just as cancer can affect everyone
in different ways, all people have the power to take various actions to reduce the impact that cancer has
on individuals, families and communities. Collectively we can inspire action, take action, prevent can-
cer, create healthy schools, workplaces and cities, support others to return to work, challenge percep-
tions, improve access to cancer care, shape policy change, etc. At individual level, one can make
healthy lifestyle choices, understand that early detection saves lives, ask for support, return to work,
take control of cancer journey, and so on.
World Encephalitis Day:  22 February
World Encephalitis Day on 22 February every year was established in 2014 by the Encephalitis Society
(founded in 1994) to increase global awareness towards people who have been affected by encephalitis.
The Encephalitis Society has a vision to have a world where encephalitis is as rare as possible, and that
those affected and their families are enabled to seek early diagnosis, and proper management of their
condition.
Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain marked by high fever, headache, vomiting, confusion and, in
severe cases, seizures, paralysis and coma. The disease can result in brain damage. Children and
elderly people are particularly susceptible to severe encephalitis. It is fatal in up to 60 percent of cases.
It can be caused by infections of various descriptions: such as the cold sore virus; it can also develop
due to body's own immune system attacking the brain. The condition can affect anyone irrespective of
age, gender, ethnic origin or geographic location. Survival rate is low and the survivors suffer from brain
injury to varying levels of disability.
