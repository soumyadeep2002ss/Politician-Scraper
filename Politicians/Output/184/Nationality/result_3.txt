Notes
On 75th Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav , let's explore the unheard contribution of Princess Surya Devi , the daughter of Raja Dahir Sen. For those who don't know , Raja Dahir Sen was the last Hindu ruler of Sindh under whom the entire Sindhu kingdom entered a golden age . There was progress , unity , and stability in the region under Raja Dahir . Sadly , Sindh was invaded by Muhammad Bin Qasim , and despite a promising battle , Raja Dahir was defeated .His body was then decapitated , and his head was sent to the governor of Basra , Al - Hajjaj ibn Yusuf . His two young daughters , princess Surya Devi and the younger one , princess Parimal Devi were captured by Muhammad Bin Qasim and sent to the Caliph ( Religious Ruler ) in Damascus as gifts . Damascus Ruler wanted to rape Raja Dahir's young virgin daughters and enslave them for life .When Surya Devi and her sister were taken to Damascus as gifts , she decided to seek revenge against Muhammad Bin Qasim for murdering his father and trying to destroy their religion in the region .At night when the Damascus Ruler entered the bedroom of their gifts Surya and her sister , Surya Devi , conveyed that she was no longer pure for the Caliph . She informed that Mummamad Bin Qasim raped her , and she is no longer a virgin . The ruler was enraged , and he immediately wrote an order that Mohammad bin Qasim be wrapped alive in raw leather , put in a box , and sent to the kingdom of Damascus immediately .On receiving the orders , the surprised ye lost Mohammad bin Qasim was treated the way it was written in the letter , and he died a very brutal , torturous , terrible death en route to Damascus . When his body came to Damascus , the ruler opened the box and showed Surya Devi what happens when somebody disgraces the Caliph and does not obey demands .She informed the Damascus ruler of how he was tricked and how this was all revenge . She wanted to protect herself and her young sister from being enslaved in the harem and being dishonored . The ruler was furious because he was indeed tricked into killing one of his most successful and so - called able generals Mohammad Bin Qasim .He ordered Princess Surya Devi and her younger sister to be ruthlessly tied to a horse's tail and run through the streets of Damascus until their last breath . The ruthless army carried out his orders immediately . Suryadevi and her sister died a bad death , but revenge was taken . She got Qasim killed and saved herself from being a slave to her father's murderers . The two girls , who were proud of having avenged her father's murder , did not have a single tear in their eyes as they embraced martyrdom .
