Murcia (EFE). The holder of the Contentious-Administrative Court number two of Murcia, Manuel Luna Carbonell, has been appointed general secretary of the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ) by agreement of the plenary session of the Government Body of the Judges.

The appointment is published on Monday in the Official State Gazette (BOE) through a resolution indicating that it will continue in the administrative situation of special services.

Natural of the Llano de Molina, Luna Carbonell was for several years judge of first instance and instruction in Molina de Segura and was then appointed for a Contentious Court of Elche.

In September 2022 he was destined for the Contentious Court number two of Murcia, although he did not take possession of the square when he was already in a situation of special services for exercising as a lawyer of CGPJ himself. EFE
