Dimensions

Jesus	and	Mary	College	was	founded	with	the	vision	of	empowering	young	girls.	We	are	committed	to	nurture	in	our	
students	the	ability	to	recognise	the	Divine	in	themselves	and	in	their	fellow	beings	and	thus	to	respect	and	embrace	
the	dignity	and	uniqueness	of	each	individual.	Our	endeavour	has	been	to	an	integrated,	all	round	value	based	
education	that	focuses	on	the	intellectual,	social,	and	spiritual	development	of	our	students	to	make	them	
compassionate	and	committed	human	beings.	We	are	committed	to	the	creation	of	a	just,	humane	and	inclusive	
society	through	transformative	education.	This	is	brought	about	by	our	competent	and	dedicated	faculty,	and		
efficient	and	committed	non-	teaching	staff.	
Education	helps	to	develop	not	only	our	personality,	thought,	behavour	and	competency	but	also	enables	us	to	
contribute	in	building	up	of	our		society,	country	and	the	world.	We	are		global	citizens.	Today	the	transport	and	
communication	network	has	brought	us	closer	to	each	other	blurring		physical	and	social	boundaries.	We	share	the	
ideas,	values	and			technologies	with		other	countries	of	the	world.	
Last	year	the	pandemic		brought	the	entire	world	to	a	standstill,	where	nothing	else	mattered	as	the	biggest	challenge	
was	to	be	alive.	Biggest	weapons,	machines	and	wealth	were	not	enough	to	fight	for	life	.	During	these	testing	times	
many	people,	forgetting	their	differences	cared	for	each	other	and	shared	whatever	they	had	with	others.	We		realised	
that	we	depend	on	each	other	for	our	health,	wealth	and	even	survival.	
This	has	been	a	very	challenging	time.	It	has	brought	us	closer	to	our	families	and	humanity	at	large	emotionally.	We	
had	to	create	new	avenues	to	reach	out	to	our	students	and	create	opportunities	for	their	mental	health	and	
education.	During	this	Pandemic	we	learnt	humbly		to	join	our	hands	in	the	presence	of	our	Creator.		Let	the	education	
we	receive		help	us	to	be	more	human	and	humane	and		continue	to	care	for	others	specially	the	old	and			the	sick.
In	our	pursuit	of	inclusive	development	we	shall	continue	to	nurture	our	institutional	ethos	for	multicultural	
thinking,	freedom	to	learn,	experiment,	question	and	innovate	through	our	processes.
I	congratulate	and	thank		the	Editorial	team	for	their	hard	work	to	bring	out	this	copy	of	the	College	Magazine.
I	entrust	you	and	all	your	families	to	the	care	of	the	Almighty.
