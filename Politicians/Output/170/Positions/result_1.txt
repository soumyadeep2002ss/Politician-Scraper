Meet Dan! üåü Training and working at Chillibreeze isn't easy, just ask Danastrum Warjri who faced similar challenges as a graphic designer. His teammates and leader pushed him for personal growth, even though he didn't understand it at first. But Dan persevered through tough times and is now leading a team, ensuring our customers are always satisfied with our work. üôå Cheers to Dan for his inspiring journey! üéâ

Short Tata Stories (SHO-T-S)

106. Together we soar

Sometimes, a beautiful film just takes your breath away.

Here is the film that Air India created to celebrate India's 75th Republic Day last week.

This film celebrates an India on the rise, a beautiful and diverse land that Air India is proud to take to the world.

It shows a nation on the rise, with its people looking up, looking forward to so much more.  It celebrates the people of our nation.

And it also showcases Air India's new A-350 aircraft, flying across the length and breadth of the country, representing a new standard that the airline looks up to.

JRD Tata, who founded Air India over 90 years ago, wanted this airline to take the best of India to the world.  It is the same dream that drives the airline today, as it moves forward on a path of rapid transformation.

I hope you enjoy this film, which has been conceptualised by the in-house Air India creative team, scripted and produced along with Supari Studios.

The opportunity Chillibreeze - Overnight PowerPoint Design Services gave me to organize events has changed my life, I never thought I would be able to do so. And I love it!

Love this financial literacy kick-off. English Tea Shop you're a #rolemodel in the The Great Game of Business community!

We kicked off the initial Huddle of the year with a financial trivia to reinforce learning and test financial literacy knowledge using terms and definitions.¬†¬†üí°

It was an exercise by The Great Game of Business centered around defining and understanding financial terms. In groups, they were tasked with defining financial words like income statement, liability, gross margin, revenue, and other. Not only did this engage everyone's financial literacy and thinking, but it also ensured that each person understood these terms precisely.

At English Tea Shop, financial literacy is pivotal in our Open Book Management practice. We eagerly anticipate doing such exercises to improve knowledge and literacy on finance. üí∞
