WRI India is an independent charity, legally registered in India, driving transformative solutions through five inter-related programs: Sustainable Cities, Climate, Energy, Sustainable Landscapes and Restoration and Climate Resilience. Our work focuses on building sustainable and liveable cities and working towards a low carbon economy.


As a think and do tank, we seek thoughtful, enterprise-minded, and sensitive individuals who can help us support India’s growth journey and make a positive difference to citizens’ everyday lives. We are inspired by and associated with World Resources Institute (WRI), a global research organisation with more than 1000 experts and other staff around the world.





WRI India programs are led by an interdisciplinary team of over 140 researchers who draw upon four cross-cutting disciplines – business, governance, finance and economics – to further their analysis and recommendations.
