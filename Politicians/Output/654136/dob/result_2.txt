Cindy Lou Hensley McCain (born May 20, 1954) is an American businesswoman and politician. McCain is the Executive Director of the World Food Programme since 2023. She was the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture from 2021 to 2023. She was the wife of Republican Senator John McCain. During the Donald Trump presidency, she became a critic of the president and the Republican Party.

In the 2020 presidential election, she was one of the few key Republicans who supported form Vice President Joe Biden over President Trump.[1]

In late November 2020, McCain was seen as a possible pick for an ambassador role in the Biden administration.[2] In May 2021, it was reported that President Biden would nominate McCain to be the United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture.[3][4] McCain was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on October 26, 2021.[5]

In April 2023, McCain became the Executive Director of the World Food Programme.
