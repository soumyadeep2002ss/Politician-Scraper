ROME - The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director, Cindy McCain, has assumed the role of Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) principals Champion on Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassment (PSEAH), taking over from Andrew Morley, President of World Vision International.

McCain takes up the vital role at a time when the unprecedented global food crisis is pushing millions of people deeper into hunger, with a particular impact on the lives of women and girls.

“Hunger puts more people- particularly women and children - at risk of sexual exploitation and abuse,” said McCain and stressed that "Seeking food or humanitarian assistance should never be a choice to sacrifice safety.”

McCain has a significant history of working on issues of PSEAH in previous positions, including advocating against human trafficking and sexual exploitation. Building on the work of her predecessor, McCain has identified three key priorities at the core of her championship, which ends in December 2024:

1) Operationalize a victim- and survivor-centered approach.

2) Promote organizational culture change through leadership and partnerships.

3) Continue support for capacity strengthening across the humanitarian sector.
