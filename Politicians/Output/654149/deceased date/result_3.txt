Benito Mussolini

How did Benito Mussolini rise to power?

Mussolini amassed a large following as an editor of a popular socialist magazine. During World War I his politics took a hard right turn as he stopped decrying the war and instead started advocating for it. After the war, he organized groups to wage campaigns of terrorism and intimidation against Italy's leftist institutions.

In 1922 Mussolini led a coalition of fascist leaders to Rome and forced the king to yield the government. Mussolini was appointed prime minister. By 1925 he had dismantled Italy's democratic government and, acting as a dictator, declared himself Il Duce ("The Leader").

What were Benito Mussolini’s political beliefs?

Mussolini was a Fascist dictator. However, initially his work was primarily socialist, organizing with trade unions and writing for leftist publications. During World War I, his politics shifted right and were characterized by themes of racial superiority, xenophobia, and imperialism.

Where did the word fascism come from?

Mussolini's paramilitary groups were called fasci di combattimento, from which his movement derived its own name, fascismo. This came from the Latin word fasces, a bundle of wooden sticks topped with an ax-head that ancient Roman authority figures’ attendants would carry to distinguish their rank.

What was Benito Mussolini’s role in World War II?

In 1939 the Pact of Steel was formalized between Mussolini and Hitler. Later that year, at the onset of World War II, Mussolini was hesitant to join the fighting. However, he entered the war in 1940. Due to preexisting resource scarcity and economic constraint, Italy fared poorly. When the Allies invaded Sicily in 1943, Mussolini's own government arrested him.

What was Benito Mussolini’s personal life like?

Mussolini was born poor, to working-class parents in northern Italy. He had two wives and many mistresses. He abandoned his first wife and their child and had five children with his second wife. He was executed in 1943 alongside his mistress Clara Petacci while attempting to flee to Switzerland. Their bodies were hung upside down in Milan.
