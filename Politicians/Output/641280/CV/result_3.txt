UfM Conference on Greening Maritime Transport in the Mediterranean  
8-9 June 2023, Barcelona, Spain. 
 
 
Recent   changes   in   global   trends,   geopolitics   and   geo-economics,   climate,   digital   technologies,   and 
infrastructure, are having a profound effect on trade, global and regional supply chains, as well as passenger 
transport  and  tourism,  and  create  uncertainties  and  have  significant  impact  on  maritime  transport  in  the 
Mediterranean region. 
A  solid  response  to  these  new  requirements,  while  achieving  a  more  sustainable  and  climate-friendly 
performance, can only be provided by the maritime sector by introducing more ambitious policies, in synergy 
with zero pollution efforts to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.  
In this framework, the UfM Conference on “Greening Maritime Transport in the Mediterranean”, co-organized 
by  the UfM  Secretariat,  the MEDports  Association and  the  Association  of  the  Mediterranean  Chambers  of 
Commerce  and  Industry  (ASCAME)  aims  to  share  knowledge  and  strengthen  cooperation  between  UfM 
countries and to explore the way forward for this green transition, in particular in the light of the renewed UfM 
mandate as endorsed by UfM Ministers of Transport on 9 February 2023..
