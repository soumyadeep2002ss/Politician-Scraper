"It's a pleasure, once again, present your memory
scientist from our research institute,
memory that reflects much more than a mere
Inventory of projects, works and articles.
It constitutes the part, probably more vocational and
disinterested in the work of our colleagues,
made in a frequently dribbled time to
His personal life, almost never paid and not
sufficiently valued globally.
In times of clinical management, waiting lists and
efficiency, we frequently ask ourselves where
The research activity is really in the
Frame of our hospitals and our profession.
And the answer is often not simple. It is clear that research is expensive:
expensive in time, in personal wear, economically ... and that is a commitment to
long term in the search for solutions to the problems posed by practice

In times of overload, rather avalanche of care activity, it is easy to fall
In discouragement, in chasticism that invested others, but the obligation of all
Those who in one way or another have responsibility in the framework of the investigation,
is trying to encourage, favor and facilitate the activity of our

During 2021 the accreditation of our institute within of
The IDEPAZ structure, as well as the integration of our researchers in different
Committees of said Institute. The future leads us to actively participate in renewal
and creation of new research support structures in its bosom.
Regarding scientific production, for the second consecutive year we have
managed to exceed 2000 points of impact factor in our publications
(2256), with practically 1500 points (1460) due to originals and reviews. This
It represents the stabilization of a trend that has been managed in recent years.
In addition, in the face of the future it is of the utmost importance that in this scientific production it is
