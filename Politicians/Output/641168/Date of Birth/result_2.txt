Together with the Irish poet and translator Michael Smith she has selected and translated poems by Juan Antonio Villacañas, Selected Poems, Shearsman Books.

Work[edit]

Beatriz Villacañas's work comprises books of poetry, short stories, articles and essays. Lyrical reflection and probing into themes such as love, death, life and suffering are characteristic of Beatriz Villacañas' poetry, together with a marked preoccupation about transcendence and spiritual questions: "El tiempo nos esculpe y nos destruye, / la eternidad aguarda y nos rescata."("Time sculptures and destroys us/ Eternity awaits and rescues")[1] "Tierra, voy a dormir contigo,/ si alguna vez despierto,/ compartiremos juntos/ la inmortalidad" (Earth, I am going to sleep with you/ If I wake up some day/ We will together share/ immortality"[2] "Cada descubrimiento alimenta un enigma nuevo" ("Each discovery nourishes a new enigma")[3] Critics have singled out the liric personality of her poetry as well as her mastery of poetic forms. Some examples: Antonio González-Guerrero wrote of Jazz: "In this world of poetry, where deceit and enmity often abound and where many are called but few chosen, such a personal and melodious voice as that of Beatriz Villacañas is a joy to the ear of the critic."[4] On Dublín, José María Balcells wrote: "The book Dublín was awarded the prize of the I Bienal Internacional de Poesía Eugenio de Nora and this will come as no surprise to its readers since they will find the book a highly original creation both in so far as the rhymical techniques deployed as also in the tone and points of view presented".[5] See also "El ángel y la física de Beatriz Villacañas". Diario Lanza (Ángel Las Navas Pagán)[6] and "Venciendo la gravedad" (Carmelo López-Arias)[7]
