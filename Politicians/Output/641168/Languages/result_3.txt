The first democratic elections, held in 1979, were won by the UCD with 11 seats, by 7 of the PSOE, 5 of the PCE and one of the Democratic Coalition and New Force. In this first stage a coalition government was formed led by the centrist Juan Ignacio de Mesa.

The PCE, already turned into the United Left could not improve its results, remaining with three councilors.
