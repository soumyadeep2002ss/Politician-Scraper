The Plenary is the body of maximum political representation of citizens in the municipal government, exercises the powers that are expressly assigned to it and is made up of the Mayor and the councillors. The councillors are elected on the basis of universal suffrage in a secret ballot, and in turn they determine the Mayor of Madrid. Plenary sessions are public. The Plenary can operate in Committees, which will be formed by the Councillors who designate the political groups in proportion to their representation in the Plenary.[3]

The Plenary (Pleno del Ayuntamiento de Madrid) is the body formed by the elected councillors. The passing of by-laws, annual budget and taxes; the scrutiny of the council of government and the motion of no confidenceon the Mayor are tasks assigned to this entity in Spain.[4]

The Plenary of the City Council of Madrid is formed by the following groups for the period 2023–2027:
