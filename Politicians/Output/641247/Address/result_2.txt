The 29 faces of capitular

The PP has won the elections in Córdoba by the hand of José María Bellido, who has obtained nine councilors with 43,434 votes and recovers the mayor's office for the popular ones if the Pact of the Junta de Andalucía is reissued in Capitular.

Isabel Ambrosio's PSOE has failed to capitalize on four years as mayor and stays with eight councilors. CS has been the party that has grown the most with five mayor while IU has sunk into the worst result in history with three representatives. Podemos and Vox, the two parties that were presented for the first time to elections in Córdoba, have obtained two councilors.

Design and programming: José Antonio Sánchez and Ángel J Cachón de Elías.
Drafting: Anabel Calero.

PP councilors

The list of José María Bellido has achieved more than 43,000 votes, about 11,000 less than four years ago, but with the new political panorama it can be said that it is a forceful victory that has earned him nine councilors.

PSOE councilors

Isabel Ambrosio's list wins almost 9,000 votes compared to four years and one more act - until reaching eight - but the accounts do not come out to reissue a government agreement with the leftist parties,

CS councilors

Citizens has been another great winner of the elections. Its mayor, Isabel Albás, has achieved 9,000 ballots more than in 2015 and passes from two councilors to five, which makes it a determinant for the relay in Capitular

United Left Councilors

IU, add and follow your debacle with Pedro García at the head. He has lost 2,000 votes regarding the municipal 2011 and has reaped the worst result in its history.

Vox councilors

Santiago Abascal's party, despite the nationwide boom, has achieved 11,788 votes in Córdoba, which gives him two councilors and places them as a governance key.

Councilors of Podemos

The purple formation of Cristina Pedrajas has achieved 9,144 votes, an achievement if what happened in the purple formation in recent months, with splits, internal division and low social visibility.
