Publications
National Conservation Policy in Asia
This volume is a collection of papers from the 2016 ICCROM-CHA Forum on National Conservation Policy. It was the fourth in a series of five forums from 2013–2017 and resulted from an ongoing collaborative effort between ICCROM and the Cultural Heritage Administration (CHA) of the Republic of Korea. This volume provides a glimpse into some of the region’s diverse national policies governing heritage conservation, from Pakistan to New Zealand. As Adeni Masni (this volume) states, “The heritage of Malaysia is an embodiment of the history, culture and values representing the Malaysian people”, and the national policies which govern its identification, protection, use and conservation demonstrate the importance of heritage to a national psyche.
