40 years
Activity monitor in social intervention with older people
Voluntary, social activist and for animal rights

Biography

I have been able to work, study and participate in various places and spaces: I started as a professional military, having the opportunity to participate in peace missions. I worked as aquatic and emergency technician. In hospitality I have been a lifetime. As a monitor and coordinator of activities, free time schools.

Currently work in the Red Cross. For six years I did it with children and young people in school support, participation and environment. I'm still working there but now with older people. This last years, I was the opportunity to work as a monitor of activities in St. Pelayo, that little town of our province so recognized, a vital experience. And sometimes ... I do almost everything together, and life ... is very tired but wonderful at the same time. And with the little time I still have left, study political sciences for UNED and participate in the circle of Podemos Valladolid.

Participation in organizations

Since childhood I liked to be part of things. Things I consider, they are important. As soon as I arrived in Valladolid I began to participate as a volunteer person in the Red Cross, where I now continue as labor personnel. More than 15 years ago I joined a group of mountain and diving called "Zceos", more than a group, my second family in this city. In 2012, friends we decided to create an association we call "smile chain", very small in size but with wonderful social projects and activities. The name may sound, perhaps ... once at the Clinical Hospital, some or some of us approached you a reading book in the room.

For 5 years he also participated in the association "The Station of Los Cats", in which we are dedicated to the management of feline colonies of the city. A great job of many hours that gives you unimaginable levels of humanity and empathy. Finally, it has already passed more than a year that we form the "Green Cricket", in which friends we develop environmental activities, with the aim of sensitizing and participating together with other associations and groups in the improvement of our environment and planet . Do not forget ... I am a militant of Podemos and now, for this 2023 we go together in VTLP.

Motivational guideline

Like many of my generation, 15M made me start worrying more about what surrounded me. I woke up with a reality slap in the middle of a crisis, surrounded by people who were tired of what was happening.

Thus, I began to participate in forums and movements that, little by little they were forming my way of thinking and doing. More critical capacity and eager to invest time and energy in working to improve people's lives. I have achieved some objectives, perhaps, for my way of doing. But there is always a horizon. It is time to step and assume responsibilities. It will be a hard commitment, but I feel the need to tell myself: today is the day, today we do it.The time has come to take a twist more to your life.
