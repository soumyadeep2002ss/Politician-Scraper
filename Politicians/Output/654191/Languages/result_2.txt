ABSTRACT
The aim of this thesis is to assess attitudes of speakers towards their local or regional 
variety.  Research in the field of sociolinguistics has shown that factors such as gender, 
age, place of residence, and social status affect linguistic behaviour and perception of 
local and regional varieties.
This thesis consists of three main parts.  In the first part the concept of language, 
minority  language,  and  dialect  is  discussed;  in  the  second  part  the  official  position 
towards local or regional varieties in Europe and in Italy is considered; in the third part 
attitudes  of speakers  towards  actions  aimed  at  safeguarding  their  local  or  regional 
varieties are analyzed.  The conclusion offers a comparison of the results of the surveys 
and a discussion on how things may develop in the future.
This  thesis  is  carried  out  within  the  framework  of  the  discipline  of 
sociolinguistics.
