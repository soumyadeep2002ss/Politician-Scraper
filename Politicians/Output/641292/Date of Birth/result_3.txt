Chairman & Commissioners

The Commission consists of five Commissioners appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to serve staggered five-year terms. The President, with the consent of the Senate, designates one of the Commissioners to serve as Chairman. No more than three Commissioners at any one time may be from the same political party.

In the absence of a Senate-confirmed Chairman, the Commission will vote to select one of the sitting Commissioners as Acting Chairman.
