PRODUCT INTRODUCTION
Rostin 10mg Tablet belongs to a group of medicines called statins. It is used to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease. Cholesterol is a fatty substance that builds up in your blood vessels and causes narrowing, which may lead to a heart attack or stroke.

Rostin 10mg Tablet is a widely prescribed medicine and is regarded as safe for long-term use. It can be taken with a meal or on an empty stomach. You can take it at any time of the day but try to take it at the same time each day. Most people with high cholesterol do not feel ill, but stopping your medicine may increase your cholesterol levels, making your condition worse and increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke.

It is important to have your cholesterol levels checked regularly. This medicine is only one part of the treatment program which should also include a healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and weight reduction. You can eat normally while taking this medicine, but try to avoid foods that are high in fat.

Common side effects of this medicine include muscle pain, weakness, nausea, headache, and stomach pain. These are usually mild and disappear after a short time. Consult your doctor if they persist or if you notice any yellowing of your eyes or get repeated or unexplained muscle pains.

This medicine should not be used in conditions such as liver disease. Also, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers should not take this medicine as it may harm the developing baby. Diabetic patients should monitor their blood sugar levels while taking this medicine, as it may lead to an increase in blood sugar levels.

BENEFITS OF ROSTIN TABLET
In Treatment of High cholesterol
Rostin 10mg Tablet belongs to a group of medicines called statins. It works by reducing the amount of “bad” cholesterol (LDL) and raising the amount of “good” cholesterol (HDL) in your blood. Lowering the amount of cholesterol reduces the chances of heart diseases and helps you remain healthier for longer.

Take it regularly and make appropriate lifestyle changes (such as eating healthy and staying active) to maximize the effectiveness of this medicine. Keep taking it even if you feel well.
In Prevention of heart attack and stroke
High levels of cholesterol can cause your blood vessels to narrow (atherosclerosis) and put you at risk of having a stroke or heart disease. Lowering the amount of this fat reduces the chances of this happening and helps you remain healthier for longer. Keep taking this medicine even if you feel well.
