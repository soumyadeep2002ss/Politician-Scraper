From the dedicated personnel of #UNGSC and partner organizations who walked side by side in #Brindisi, to the hundreds of students, #UN entities, local, and international NGOs who gathered at the City of Arts and Sciences in #Valencia, today‚Äôs events have been heartening, for us all.¬†
¬†
Even amid great challenges and divisions, we can find strength and unity in our shared mission to build a more inclusive, innovative, and peaceful world.

A warm thank you to all the charities and social associations for joining us today at the United Nations Global Service Centre's Solidary Fair.
¬†
In a world marked by division, challenges and conflicts, this year we chose #solidarity to be our guiding principle. As we acknowledge the shared responsibility we bear in shaping a world that is just, compassionate, and united, we want solidarity to be not only a theme but a daily call to action.
¬†
Thanks also to all #UNGSC colleagues, friends and families for their presence today, in the spirit of sharing and giving that binds us together as a global community.¬†¬†

It was encouraging to hear chiefs of missions coming from the field say, while having a tour of our base in Brindisi, that ‚Äúa full day is not enough to see all the innovative solutions and services that the United Nations Global Service Centre provides‚Äù.¬†From containerized renewable energy solutions to 3D-printed accommodation that uses local soil and can be designed to blend into the local communities, to mobile repair workshops and much more, our #SolutionFactory serves the needs of the field.

I would like to thank the Chiefs of Mission Support Mr. Andrew Brimelow (#UNMHA), Mr. Jorge Goncalves (#UNAMA), and Mr. Robert Kirkwood (#UNISFA) for their visit to #UNGSC and the great two-way exchange. It was a pleasure having them here, listening to their experience and discussing how to concretely tailor solutions for operations in Yemen, Afghanistan and Abyei. I look forward to continuing these inspiring conversations to shape the future of our service provision.

It was my pleasure to meet with Mr. Giuseppe Marchionna, the newly elected Mayor of Brindisi. 
We are and have always been grateful to the City of Brindisi which, since 1994, has welcomed the United Nations Global Service Centre and its vibrant international community.
We will work together on the many areas of common interest so that Brindisi can be recognized worldwide as the ‚ÄúCity of Peace‚Äù.
