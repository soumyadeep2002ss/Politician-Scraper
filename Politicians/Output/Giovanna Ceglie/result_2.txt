Do you know the difference between Gender Equality and Gender Parity? 

Although often used interchangeably, these terms hold distinct meanings. Gender Equality implies equal rights, opportunities, and treatment for all individuals, regardless of gender. 
Conversely, Gender Parity focuses on achieving equal representation of men and women in specific areas like #education, workforce, or #leadership roles. While Gender Equality is the broader goal, Gender Parity is a crucial step toward its realization.

Understanding Parity and Equality

Did you know?
 
Globally, women only make up 22.9%% of parliamentary representatives. 
This lack of representation hinders the ability to address gender equality issues effectively, as governments with gender parity are more likely to prioritize policies that promote gender equality.

To achieve true gender equality, we need to see a significant increase in the number of women in leadership positions. 

Gender equality is a fundamental human right and a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world. As outlined by the UN's SDG 5, it entails the provision of equal opportunities, rights, and treatment to individuals. 
Together, let's work towards a world where all individuals and women have equal opportunities to participate in shaping our collective future.

A warm thank you to all the charities and social associations for joining us today at the United Nations Global Service Centre's Solidary Fair.
 
In a world marked by division, challenges and conflicts, this year we chose #solidarity to be our guiding principle. As we acknowledge the shared responsibility we bear in shaping a world that is just, compassionate, and united, we want solidarity to be not only a theme but a daily call to action.
 
Thanks also to all #UNGSC colleagues, friends and families for their presence today, in the spirit of sharing and giving that binds us together as a global community.
