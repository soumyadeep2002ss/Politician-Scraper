Consuelo Porras has been in charge of the Public Ministry for five years as the Attorney General.

He was appointed in the position in May 2018 by former President Jimmy Morales and in May 2022 President Alejandro Giammattei confirmed it in the position in a second period.

Porras must leave the Attorney General's Office in May 2026.

During this time, every month Porras has received a salary greater than Q50 thousand, according to information access reports.

Previously the Attorney General earned Q48,644.15 as a base salary, more Q3,628.00 in bonds and Q10,000 in representation expenses, for a total of Q62,272.15

But that changed from January 2023, since the same prosecutor prescribed a salary increase, which covered employees of the Public Ministry.

Salary increase

According to Agreement number 41-2022 dated December 29, 2022, the Attorney General agreed to make a salary readjustment for personnel 011, 022 and 031.

Article 2 of that agreement establishes that the increase to the base for line 011, to which Porras belongs, will be Q1,500.00.

With this, the base salary of the Attorney General is Q50,144.15, more Q4,669 of bonds and Q10,000 of representation expenses, which gives a total of Q64,813.15

Consuelo Porras sanctioned

In May 2022, the United States Department of State announced through a statement, a new appointment against Consuelo Porras, recently reelected attorney general and head of the Public Ministry (MP).

According to the US, Porras repeatedly obstructed and underground the anti -corruption investigations in Guatemala, "to protect their political allies and obtain undue political favors."

This new sanction includes Porras husband, Gilberto de Jesús Porras de Paz, which means that now both are sanctioned with the retirement of the visa because they are not eligible to enter the United States. Porras had already retired the visa since the late 2021.
