Controversies

On July 23, 2021 he dismissed Juan Francisco Sandoval, a prosecutor in charge of the Feci Section Prosecutor's Office (Special Prosecutor's Office against Impunity), who had been awarded by the United States for his work against corruption. This caused the rejection of a group of people and officials from the United States who saw an effective ally and worker in him. The reason for the decision was because, according to the Prosecutor's Office, he did not follow orders and was practically forming a parallel power within the Public Ministry taking advantage of the recognition of other countries. On the other hand, the supporters of the dismissed prosecutor explained that this was to hinder investigations carried out in the Prosecutor's Office, to this day neither of the two parties have verified any accusation.

On July 26, 2021, the academic Marco Fonseca published alleged evidence about the plagiarism that Porras made in the preparation of his doctoral thesis, which he presents as his own and without giving
