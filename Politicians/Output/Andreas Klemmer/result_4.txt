🌿New course for policy-makers🌿 How Nature-based Solutions can support #Justtransition with #decentwork!!

🌍Currently, 75 million people are employed by #NaturebasedSolutions or #nbs - and potentially 20 million new jobs can be generated by 2030, but 'just transition' policies are needed. Governments are facing an increasing demand to create #decentwork opportunities while protecting workers and employment during the transition to #lowcarboneconomies.

The International Labour Organization, UN Environment Programme, IUCN and ITCILO designed a new course which equips policymakers with a "how to" guide on designing decent work in NbS . NbS offer an opportunity to create immediate "no harm" jobs, while at the same time supporting a transition to a greener and job-rich economy.

🚀 Why Join?
The course is designed for policy makers that aim to influence the design and implementation of local, sectoral, national and global strategies for the transition to greener economies and NbS.

Participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of decent work and NbS principles and guidelines, which will enable informed decision-making.

📅 Starting date: 8th April until 3rd of May 📍 Location: Virtual
