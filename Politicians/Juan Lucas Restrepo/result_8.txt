What comes to mind when you think of an entrepreneur? Is it a cacao farmer? 

Cacao farmers are not just cultivators, but true entrepreneurs and experts in their business, from running their farms to navigating the ups and downs of the market. 

They are truly the unsung heroes of the chocolate we all enjoy today. This is why we do what we do. Empowering, recognising, and rewarding cacao farmers for more fair and sustainable #foodsystems.  

Now sit back, relax and soak up 5 reasons you'll want to tune-into the world's premier global cacao competition, the Cacao of Excellence Awards.üëáüèæüåü

As we approach the end of this year, I'm filled with pride and gratitude for our collective achievements as CGIAR and the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT.

Thanks to our scientists who keep striving to produce new #science and #innovation to leave no one behind.

A big thanks goes also to our #partners, a key element in the engine of scientific innovation, and of course to our funders, for continuing to believe in our potential to achieve #zerohunger and combat #climatechange.

There still lots to do to achieve our mission and one year less separating us from 2030, so 2024 will be all about acceleration and stepping up our efforts. 

Wishing you all joyful holidays, filled with cherished moments and a chance to recharge for the opportunities and challenges the new year holds.

What a week at #COP28 !

1Ô∏è‚É£ CGIAR hosted for the second year the #Food and #Agricuture pavilion, together with FAO International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and The Rockefeller Foundation

2Ô∏è‚É£ We launched the Alliance of Champions along with three countries and multiple partners - a mechanism that will help build coherence across global policy processes on #foodsystem, #climatechange and #biodiversity

3Ô∏è‚É£ We supported multiple negotiation processes including the #SSJWA, #GST and #GGA, providing #evidence and #science

And much more!

Thanks to all our #partners and colleagues from across the world who joined us to raise awareness on the importance of including #food into #climate conversations. We might not be there yet, but we will keep working hard to keep #food high on the agenda.
